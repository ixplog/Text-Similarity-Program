The yottametre ( SI symbol: Ym) is a unit of length in the metric system equal to 1024 metres

To help compare different orders of magnitude, this page lists distances starting at 1 Ym (1024 m or 106 million light years).

Distances shorter than 1 Ym

1.2 Ym — 127 million light years — Distance to the closest observed gamma ray burst GRB 980425

1.3 Ym — 137 million light years — Distance to the Centaurus Cluster of galaxies, the nearest large supercluster

1.9 Ym — 201 million light years — Diameter of the Local Supercluster

2.8 Ym — 296 million light years — Distance to the Coma Cluster

3.2 Ym — 338 million light years — Distance to the Stephan's Quintet

4.7 Ym — 496 million light years — Length of the CfA2 Great Wall, one of the largest observed superstructures in the Universe

6.1 Ym — 645 million light years — Distance to the Shapley Supercluster

9.5 Ym — 996 million light years — Diameter of the Eridanus Supervoid
