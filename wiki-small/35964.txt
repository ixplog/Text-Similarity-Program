To help compare different distances this page lists lengths between 1017 m (100 Pm or 11 light years) and 1018 m (106 light years).

Distances shorter than 100 Pm

110 Pm — 12 light years — Distance to Tau Ceti

240 Pm — 25 light years — Distance to Vega

260 Pm — 27 light years — Distance to Chara, a star approximately as bright as our Sun. Its faintness gives us an idea how our Sun would appear when viewed from even so close a distance as this.

350 Pm — 24 light years — Diameter of the Orion Nebula

350 Pm — 37 light years — Distance to Arcturus

400 Pm — 42 light years — Distance to Capella

620 Pm — 65 light years — Distance to Aldebaran Distances longer than 1 Em
