This article deals with the system of transport in Namibia, both public and private.

1. Road

Namibia's road network is regarded as one of the best on the continent; road construction and maintenance adheres to international standards. The country's more than roads are administered by the Roads Authority, a state-owned enterprise established by Act #17 of 1999. Due to low traffic volumes the majority of roads are not tarred. The distribution of road surfaces is:

standard bitumen road

low-volume bitumen road. These roads have the same base layer as gravel roads but are covered with a thin layer of bitumen to reduce maintenance cost and dust formation.

standard gravel road, covered with imported gravel.

earth-graded road. These roads are built by clearing the vegetation and blading the surface. Compaction is achieved by the traffic using the road. Some of these roads are not graded at all but just consist of earth or sand tracks separated by vegetation. These tracks are in use where a daily usage of less than five vehicles is expected.

salt road. These roads consist of concentrated salt water and gypsum-rich material. They are only built near the Atlantic coast inside the mist belt. The major highways in Namibia are:

B1 from Noordoewer (South African border) to Oshikango (Angolan border), 1694 km

B2 from Walvis Bay to Okahandja, 285 km

B3 from Nakop (South African border) to Grünau, 324 km

B4 from Lüderitz to Keetmanshoop, 351 km

B6 from Windhoek to Buitepos (Botswana border), 335 km

B8 from Otavi to Katima Mulilo (Zambian border), 837 km there are about 270,000 cars registered in Namibia, almost half of them in the capital Windhoek.

1.1. Road accidents

Namibia has a relatively high prevalence of road accidents, compared to its sparse population. In 2011, 491 people died in 2,846 crashes. Causes are often speeding and reckless driving, as well as general non-observance of traffic rules. Stray animals are also a major cause of accidents, particularly in the Kavango Region.

2. Railway

In 2005, a line to Ondangwa near the Angolan border was under construction. Railways in Namibia are operated by TransNamib.

Total track: 2,382 km Total narrow gauge track: 2,382 km gauge; single track (2002, 1995)

2.1. Railway links to adjacent countries

Angola - There is currently no rail connection to Angola, although an agreement has been signed for link. Angola uses the same gauge,, as Namibia. (Rail transport in Angola)

Botswana- There is currently no rail-link with Botswana, though the two countries use the same gauge. As of February 2011, construction on a Trans-Kalahari rail link between Botswanan coal fields and Walvis Bay was expected to begin in a year and a half. (Rail transport in Botswana)

South Africa- There is a rail connection to South Africa; the two countries use the same gauge. (Rail transport in South Africa)

Zambia- There is currently no rail-link with Zambia, though the two countries use the same gauge. As of February 2011, there has been some talk of extending rail to the Zambian border. (Rail transport in Zambia)

December - Progress

26 October - Talks between Namibia and Angola regarding a link between Namibia and Chamutete in Angola.

18 October - According to an Engineering News report, a 700 km extension of the Grootfontein branch is planned, to Katima Mulilo on the Zambian border. A feasibility study by March 2008. Walvis Bay Corridor Group says "Our focus is on trade facilitation through a cheaper and faster route. We are targeting the copper mines in Zambia. Katima Mulilo is about 130 km from the nearest railway in Zambia as the crow flies, once the Zambesi has been bridged. The lightly laid Mulobezi branch from Livingstone ( 80 km or so ) would need upgrading, although a shorter and straighter route might be considered.
