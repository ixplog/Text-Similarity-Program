The Dartmoor Worker is a collection, first assembled in 1966, of newspaper articles originally written for The Western Morning News by the principal authority on Dartmoor and its history, William Crossing, in the early 1900s. The book is illustrated with many photographs from the collection of Lady Sayer, a highly influential member of the Dartmoor Preservation Association during the mid 20th century.

The book details the activities of a number of workers on the moor, such as the farmers, the dry-stone wall builders, the peat-cutters, the warreners, and miners.
