Anthony "Tony" Peter Buzan (; born 2 June 1942) is an English author and educational consultant. He claims to have invented the thinking technique of Mind Mapping (though, as he says, it was used before him, by Leonardo Da-Vinci and others.) and mental literacy.

1. Background

Buzan was born in Palmers Green, Enfield, Middlesex. He is an alumnus of Kitsilano Secondary School in Vancouver, where he was Head Boys' Prefect 1959-60. His brother is the academic Barry Buzan. He is a promoter of mnemonic systems and mind mapping techniques. He launched his own software programme to support mind mapping called in December 2006. The Buzan Organisation holds trademarks on the phrase 'mind map' in the context of self-improvement educational courses in the UK, the USA and Germany. The trademark does not appear in the records of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.

Following his 1970s series Use Your Head for the BBC, many of his ideas have been set into his series of five books: Use Your Memory, Master Your Memory, Use Your Head, The Speed Reading Book and The Mind Map Book. He has since authored or co-authored over 100 books that have appeared in 30 languages..

As a popular psychology author, Tony Buzan has written on subjects relating to the brain, "genius quotient (GQ)", spiritual intelligence, memory, creativity and speed reading. He is the founder and President of the Brain Foundation (not to be confused with various medical-related bodies with the same name) and also the Brain Trust Charity, the World Memory Championships and the World Championships of the Brain. He was a co-founder of London's Mind Body Spirit Festival as well as the Mind Sports Olympiad.

Some critics have labeled his claims as pseudoscience and question the existence of evidence of the usefulness of mind mapping.
