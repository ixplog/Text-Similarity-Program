The 22nd century is a century of the Christian Era or Common Era in accordance with the Gregorian calendar. It is the century following the current 21st century, beginning on January 1, 2101 and ending on December 31, 2200.

1. Technological predictions

Work on cleaning up the site of the Oldbury Nuclear Power Station near Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, England, which was decommissioned on 29 February 2012, is scheduled to be complete between 2092 and 2101.

According to the Discovery Channel documentary, Extreme Engineering, the Japanese proposed Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid could be complete by 2110.

The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) initiated by Stanford University will be concluded in 2115.

2162 or later: The satellite Envisat, declared "dead" in 2012, is expected to deorbit and burn up in the atmosphere no earlier than 2162.

By 2200, it is predicted that Earth will become a Type I civilization on the Kardashev scale, according to Nikolai Kardashev's extrapolation of 1% energy usage growth per year.

2. Social predictions

2160 – Some scientists believe there are babies born in 2010 who may still be alive in 2160.

According to the UN Population Bureau, life expectancy in 2200 will be around 100 for developed countries and the world population will be about 8.5 billion. However, the UN has warned that these projections could be invalidated by any change and progress in future life extension technology and discoveries, as well as changes in future birthrates.

In his book The Next 100 Years, American political scientist George Friedman predicts that as the century begins, an ongoing confrontation between an increasingly powerful Mexico and the United States will be taking place. Mexico will be an economically and militarily powerful country capable of challenging the United States, while a Mexican majority in southern regions of the United States will have made them a de facto extension of Mexico, with increasing secessionist sentiment. Both countries will be competing for dominance over North America, which will remain the international centre of gravity throughout the next few centuries.

3. Biological predictions

By 2100, 12% (about 1250) of the bird species existing at the beginning of the 21st century are expected to be extinct or threatened with extinction.

By 2100, emperor penguins could be pushed to the brink of extinction due to global climate change, according to a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution study from January 2009. The study applied mathematical models to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming would affect an Antarctica colony of emperor penguins, and they forecast a decline of 87% in the colony's population by the end of the century.

4. Calendric predictions

On March 14, 2100 (which will be February 29, 2100 in the Julian calendar), the difference between the Julian calendar and the Gregorian calendar reaches 14 days. Since 14 is divisible by 7, this will be the first time in history since its inception that the Gregorian calendar will have the same day of the week for each day of the month for the whole year as the Julian calendar. This will last until February 28, 2200 of the Gregorian Calendar.

2100 will not be a leap year since it qualifies as a year that is divisible by 100, but not by 400.

FAT file systems theoretically support dates up to December 31, 2107, (though officially only up to December 31, 2099).

The Year type in MySQL supports dates up to December 31, 2155.

March 17, 2160 – Unless changes are made as to when Easter can be observed, this particular March 17 will fall within Holy Week for the first time since 2008 and fall on the same day (Monday) as it did in that year, likely requiring the movement of the Feast of Saint Patrick's Day to another date.

5. Time capsules

April 27, 2109 – A time capsule placed under the floor boards of the Old Queens Building at Rutgers University, in New Jersey, United States buried on April 27, 2009 is scheduled to be opened.

September 19, 2110 – A time capsule at the Plaza de Armas in Santiago, Chile is intended to be opened on that date. It was buried in 2010.

November 18, 2112 – The City of Beaumont, California in the United States will open their time capsule in honor of its Bi-Centennial.

2132 – A time capsule on Rideau Street in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada is intended to be opened that year. It was buried in 1982.

2193: A time capsule at the York Civic Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada is intended to be opened that year. It was buried in 1997.

2112 - a time capsule buried in Weavers Academy, Wellingborough, UK, will be opened after 100 years of being buried.

6. Astronomical predictions

6.1. Solar eclipses

December 8, 2113 : Annular solar eclipse, (9 min 35 s), Solar Saros 134.

June 3, 2114 : Total solar eclipse of 6 min 32 s, Solar Saros 139.

December 19, 2131 : Annular solar eclipse, (10 min 14 s), saros 134.

June 13, 2132 : Total solar eclipse of 6 min 55 s, saros 139.

December 30, 2149 : Annular solar eclipse, (10 min 42 s), saros 134.

June 25, 2150: Solar eclipse of 7 min 14 s, Solar Saros 139.
Exceeding 7 minutes of totality, this will be the first time this has happened in 177 years; the last one occurred on June 30, 1973. when the Concorde prototype followed the totality spot during 73 minutes.

January 10, 2168 : Annular solar eclipse, (10 min 55 s), saros 134.

July 5, 2168 : Total solar eclipse of 7 min 26 s, saros 139.
