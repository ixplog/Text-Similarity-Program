To help compare different orders of magnitude, this page lists distances starting at 10 Ym (1025 m or 1.1 gigalight-years). At this scale, expansion of the universe becomes significant. Distance of these objects are derived from their measured redshifts, which depends on the cosmological models used.

Distances shorter than 10 Ym

13.7 Ym — 1.37 gigalight-years 舒 Length of the Sloan Great Wall

18 Ym — redshift 0.16 — 1.9 gigalight-years 舒 Distance to the quasar 3C 273 (light travel distance)

33 Ym — 3.5 gigalight-years 舒 Maximum distance of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (light travel distance)

37.8 Ym — 4 gigalight-years 舒 Length of the Huge-LQG, one of the largest and most massive known cosmic structure.

75 Ym — redshift 0.95 — 8 gigalight-years — Approximate distance to the supernova SN 2002dd in the Hubble Deep Field North (light travel distance)

85 Ym — redshift 1.6 — 9 gigalight-years — Approximate distance to the gamma ray burst GRB 990123 (light travel distance)

94.6 Ym — 10 gigalight-years — Approximate distance to quasar OQ172 Distances longer than 100 Ym
