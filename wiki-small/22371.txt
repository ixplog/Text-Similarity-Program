1. Career

Lieb began his musical career at the age of fourteen, as a bassist, playing in funk and soul bands. However, he often left the bands he played in before they found any real success. Eventually he started exploring electronic music.

His first records, under the alias 'Force Legato', were released by ZYX Music. In 1992, Lieb met Matthias Schindehutte, A&R man for the newly formed Harthouse record label, who contracted him for the Spicelab project. At the same time, Lieb started work on harder tracks, released using the alias Psilocybin. 1993 saw his first releases under the alias L.S.G., which he discontinued in 2007. In 1994, he first co-operated with Harald Gro√ükopf (whom he later also performed with live), releasing tracks using the alias The Ambush.

In 1997, using the alias LSG, Lieb spent one week at #63 in the UK Singles Chart with "Netherworld". In 2000, and using his own name, he appeared in the UK Singles Chart for one week at #72 with the track "Metropolis", billed as 'Oliver Lieb presents Smoked'.
