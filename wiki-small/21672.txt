The nucleariids are a group of amoebae with filose pseudopods, known mostly from soils and freshwater. They are distinguished from the superficially similar vampyrellids mainly by having mitochondria with discoid cristae.

1. Classification

Nucleariids are opisthokonts, the group which includes animals, fungi and several smaller groups. Several studies place the nucleariids as a sister group to the fungi.

2. Characteristics

Nucleariids are usually small, up to about 50 Î¼m in size.

Nuclearia and Micronuclearia.

The other genera, Rabdiophrys, Pinaciophora, and Pompholyxophrys, are freshwater forms with hollow siliceous scales or spines. These were formerly included among the heliozoa as the Rotosphaerida. According to a 2009 paper, Fonticula, a cellular slime mold, is an opisthokont and more closely related to Nuclearia than to fungi.
