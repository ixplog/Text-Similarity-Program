A photosynthetic pigment (accessory pigment; chloroplast pigment; antenna pigment) is a pigment that is present in chloroplasts or photosynthetic bacteria and captures the light energy necessary for photosynthesis.

1. Bacteria

Like plants, the cyanobacteria use water as an electron donor for photosynthesis and therefore liberate oxygen; they also use chlorophyll as a pigment. In addition, most cyanobacteria use phycobiliproteins, water soluble pigments which occur in the cytoplasm of the chloroplast, to capture light energy and pass it on to the chlorophylls. (Some cyanobacteria, the prochlorophytes, use chlorophyll b instead of phycobilin.) It is thought that the chloroplasts in plants and algae all evolved from cyanobacteria.

Several other groups of bacteria use the bacteriochlorophyll pigments (similar to the chlorophylls) for photosynthesis. Unlike the cyanobacteria, these bacteria do not produce oxygen; they typically use hydrogen sulfide rather than water as the electron donor.

Recently, a very different pigment has been found in some marine Î³-proteobacteria: proteorhodopsin. It is similar to and probably originated from bacteriorhodopsin (see below under archaea). Bacterial chlorophyll b has been isolated from Rhodopseudomonas spp. but its structure is not yet known

2. Algae

Green algae, red algae and glaucophytes all use chlorophylls. Red algae and glaucophytes also use phycobiliproteins, but green algae do not.

3. Archaea

Halobacteria use the pigment bacteriorhodopsin which acts directly as a proton pump when exposed to light.
