3. Air Force

The Togolese Air Force (French: Armée de l'Air Togolaise) was established in 1964, and a French influence remains on the choice of aircraft used. Since 2005, the air force's chief of staff is Colonel Bouraïma Bonfoh.

The C-47 Skytrain was the first aircraft used; it was part of the force from 1960 to 1976. Replacing the C-47s were two DHC-5D Buffalo STOL transports in 1976. Also in the same year Togo acquired five ex-German Air Force Fouga Magister armed jet trainers and seven EMB.326GBs from Brazil to form the Escadrille de Chasse. Togo's armed jet trainer fleet was upgraded in 1981 by the deliveries of five Alpha jets and by three piston engine Aerospatiale TB-30 Epsilons in 1986. The Fouga Magisters were returned to France in 1985. During its existence the official name changed from Section Air der Forces armées Togolais in 1964 to Escadrille Nationale Togolaise in 1973, to Groupement Aerienne Togolaise (GAT) in 1980, and finally to Armée de l'Air Togolaise in 1997.

At present its operations are concentrated to the Base Transport de Lomé (Lomé Transport Base) at Lomé Tokoin Airport, where the transport aircraft are based, and the Base Chasse Niamtougou (Niamtougou Fighter Base) at Niamtougou International Airport, where the combat units are located.
