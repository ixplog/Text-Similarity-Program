This article is about the demographic features of the population of Kuwait.

Kuwaiti citizens accounted for 40% of Kuwait's total population in 2011, the rest is foreigners. The majority of Kuwait's citizen population is Muslim; there are no official figures, but it is estimated that 60%–70% are Sunni and 30%–40% are Shias. Kuwait has a native Christian community; in 1999, there were 400 Christian Kuwaiti citizens. There is also a small number of Bahá'í Kuwaiti citizens. The country has a large community of expatriate Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and Sikhs.

Kuwait consists of six governorates: Hawalli, Asimah, Farwaniyah, Jahra, Ahmadi and Mubarak Al-Kabeer. Most Kuwaitis live in Hawalli, Asimah and Farwaniyah governorates. The governorates of Jahra, Ahmadi and Mubarak Al-Kabeer are outlying areas (manatiq kharijiyya). Although Jahra, Ahmadi and Mubarak Al-Kabeer represent 53% of the electorate.

The government and people of Kuwait consider the high level of immigrants to be a problem. This led to the announcement in 2013 that Kuwait will reduce the number of expatriates by deporting 100,000 expats annually over the next 10 years. A recent proposal by a Kuwaiti lawmaker restricts all expats to only five years residence in Kuwait, all expats will be deported after living 5 years in Kuwait. Another Kuwaiti lawmaker recently called for the deportation of 1.4 million expats, the lawmaker believes 280,000 expats should be deported annually. Kuwait has placed heavy restrictions on expats seeking driving licenses and excluded others from receiving a license, including students and the unemployed.

1. Religions

Most of Kuwait's citizen population is Muslim; there are no official figures, but it is estimated that 60%-70% are Sunni and 30%-40% are Shias. There are 100,000 non-citizen Shia residents in Kuwait and there are no estimates for the non-citizen Sunni residents.

In 2001, there were 525,000 Sunni Kuwaiti citizens, 300,000 Shia Kuwaiti citizens and 820,000 Kuwaiti citizens in total thus Sunnis formed 64% and Shias formed 36.5% of the Kuwaiti citizen population. In 2002, the US Department of State reported that Shia Kuwaitis formed 30%-40% of Kuwait's citizen population, noting there were 525,000 Sunni Kuwaiti citizens and 855,000 Kuwaiti citizens in total (61% Sunnis, 39% Shias). In 2004, there were 600,000 Sunni Kuwaitis citizens, 300,000-350,000 Shia Kuwaiti citizens and 913,000 Kuwaiti citizens in total.

Kuwait also has a native Christian community. In 1999, there were 400 Christian Kuwaiti citizens. There is also a small number of Bahá'í Kuwaiti citizens. Most foreigners in Kuwait are Muslim, Hindu, Christian or Buddhist.

2. Governorates

Kuwait consists of six governorates: Hawalli, Asimah, Farwaniyah, Jahra, Ahmadi and Mubarak Al-Kabeer. Most Kuwaitis live in the governorates of Hawalli, Asimah and Farwaniyah. The governorates of Jahra, Ahmadi and Mubarak Al-Kabeer are outlying areas (manatiq kharijiyya).

3. Historical populations

The biggest population difficulty in Kuwait involves the Bidoon, stateless people numbering just over 100,000 who are classed as illegal residents and who are trying to claim Kuwaiti citizenship. Critics argue that these people are Arabs who migrated from Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia; a large part of the problem the Bidoon face is that these other states do not consider them as their nationals either. In 2013 a law was passed to grant citizenship to 4,000 of these people as part of an attempt to resolve the problem. However, the government has said that only a third of the Bidoon would qualify for possible naturalisation as it considers that the rest hold other nationalities, with officials alleging that they have destroyed their documents in order to claim Kuwaiti citizenship.
