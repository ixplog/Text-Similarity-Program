The Netherlands Antilles was an autonomous entity within the Kingdom of the Netherlands and consisted of the following five islands: Bonaire, Cura√ßao, Saba, Sint Eustatius and the Dutch part of Saint Martin (Sint Maarten).

The Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands () defined the association between the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. The overseas territories were autonomous, although there were a limited number of affairs which were handled by the Kingdom as a whole. These "Kingdom affairs" included foreign relations.

The government of the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved on 10 October 2010.
