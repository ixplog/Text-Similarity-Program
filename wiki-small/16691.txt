As an oil rich nation, Transport in Kuwait is largely road based, one car for every 2.25 people. Bus services make up Kuwait's entire public transport network, as the country has no rail infrastructure. Several railways are planned, including a Kuwait City metro. Kuwait has several maritime ports along the Persian Gulf. There are seven airports, the largest and only for civil-use is Kuwait International Airport.

1. Railways

Kuwait doesn't have any rail infrastructure, though increasing congestion on the country's roads has led to several railway projects being planned. Kuwait City would form one terminus of the proposed Gulf Railway, a railway network which will run from Kuwait to Oman, via cities across the Gulf.A four line, , metro network within Kuwait city is also in the planning stages.

2. Metro

The Kuwait Metropolitan Rapid Transit System Project is a planned four-line metro network which will total 160 km with 69 stations.

3. Road transport

As a nation with one car to every 2.25 people, Kuwait relies heavily on its road network for transportation. The total length of paved and unpaved roads was 6,524km in 2009. Traffic congestion is common throughout the day, particularly in Kuwait City.

Kuwait has one of the highest traffic accident death rates in the world, with hundreds of people killed, and thousands injured, every year. In the first half of 2012 the number of tickets issued for violations of traffic laws exceeded the number of registered vehicles.

As there are no railways country's public transport network consists almost entirely of bus routes. The state owned Kuwait Public Transportation Company was established in 1962. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait as well as longer distance services to other Gulf states. The main private bus company is CityBus, which operates about 20 routes across the country. Another private bus company, Kuwait Gulf Link Public Transport Services, was started in 2006. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait and longer distance services to neighbouring Arab countries.
