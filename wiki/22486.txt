In astrophysics and physical cosmology  Olbers  paradox  named after the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers  1758–1840  and also called the  dark night sky paradox   is the argument that the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the assumption of an infinite and eternal static universe  The darkness of the night sky is one of the pieces of evidence for a non static universe such as the Big Bang model  If the universe is static  homogeneous at a large scale  and populated by an infinite number of stars  any sight line from Earth must end at the  very bright  surface of a star  so the night sky should be completely bright  This contradicts the observed darkness of the night   1  History  Edward Robert Harrison s Darkness at Night  A Riddle of the Universe  1987  gives an account of the dark night sky paradox  seen as a problem in the history of science  According to Harrison  the first to conceive of anything like the paradox was Thomas Digges  who was also the first to expound the Copernican system in English and also postulated an infinite universe with infinitely many stars  Kepler also posed the problem in 1610  and the paradox took its mature form in the 18th century work of Halley and Cheseaux  The paradox is commonly attributed to the German amateur astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers  who described it in 1823  but Harrison shows convincingly that Olbers was far from the first to pose the problem  nor was his thinking about it particularly valuable  Harrison argues that the first to set out a satisfactory resolution of the paradox was Lord Kelvin  in a little known 1901 paper  and that Edgar Allan Poe s essay Eureka  1848  curiously anticipated some qualitative aspects of Kelvin s argument   2  The paradox  The paradox is that a static  infinitely old universe with an infinite number of stars distributed in an infinitely large space would be bright rather than dark   To show this  we divide the universe into a series of concentric shells  1 light year thick  Thus  a certain number of stars will be in the shell 1 000 000 000 to 1 000 000 001 light years away  If the universe is homogeneous at a large scale  then there would be four times as many stars in a second shell between 2 000 000 000 to 2 000 000 001 light years away  However  the second shell is twice as far away  so each star in it would appear four times dimmer than the first shell  Thus the total light received from the second shell is the same as the total light received from the first shell   Thus each shell of a given thickness will produce the same net amount of light regardless of how far away it is  That is  the light of each shell adds to the total amount  Thus the more shells  the more light  And with infinitely many shells there would be a bright night sky   Dark clouds could obstruct the light  But in that case the clouds would heat up  until they were as hot as stars  and then radiate the same amount of light   Kepler saw this as an argument for a finite observable universe  or at least for a finite number of stars  In general relativity theory  it is still possible for the paradox to hold in a finite universe  though the sky would not be infinitely bright  every point in the sky would still be like the surface of a star   3  The mainstream explanation  Poet Edgar Allan Poe suggested that the finite size of the observable universe resolves the apparent paradox  More specifically  because the universe is finitely old and the speed of light is finite  only finitely many stars can be observed within a given volume of space visible from Earth  although the whole universe can be infinite in space   The density of stars within this finite volume is sufficiently low that any line of sight from Earth is unlikely to reach a star   However  the Big Bang theory introduces a new paradox  it states that the sky was much brighter in the past  especially at the end of the recombination era  when it first became transparent  All points of the local sky at that era were comparable in brightness to the surface of the sun  due to the high temperature of the universe in that era  and most light rays will terminate not in a star but in the relic of the Big Bang   This paradox is explained by the fact that the Big Bang theory also involves the expansion of space which can cause the energy of emitted light to be reduced via redshift  More specifically  the extreme levels of radiation from the Big Bang have been redshifted to microwave wavelengths  1100 times longer than its original wavelength  as a result of the cosmic expansion  and thus form the cosmic microwave background radiation  This explains the relatively low light densities present in most of our sky despite the assumed bright nature of the Big Bang  The redshift also affects light from distant stars and quasars  but the diminution is minor  since the most distant galaxies and quasars have redshifts of only around 5 to 8 6   4  Alternative explanations  4 1  Steady state  The redshift hypothesised in the Big Bang model would by itself explain the darkness of the night sky  even if the universe were infinitely old  The steady state cosmological model assumed that the universe is infinitely old and uniform in time as well as space  There is no Big Bang in this model  but there are stars and quasars at arbitrarily great distances  The light from these distant stars and quasars will be redshifted accordingly  by the Doppler effect and thermalisation   so that the total light flux from the sky remains finite  Thus the observed radiation density  the sky brightness of extragalactic background light  can be independent of finiteness of the Universe  Mathematically  the total electromagnetic energy density  radiation energy density  in thermodynamic equilibrium from Planck s law is  e g  for temperature 2 7 K it is 40 fJ m3     4 5×10−31 kg m3 and for visible temperature 6000 K we get 1 J m3     1 1×10−17 kg m3  But the total radiation emitted by a star  or other cosmic object  is at most equal to the total nuclear binding energy of isotopes in the star  For the density of the observable universe of about 4 6×10−28 kg m3 and given the known abundance of the chemical elements  the corresponding maximal radiation energy density of 9 2×10−31 kg m3  i e  temperature 3 2 K  This is close to the summed energy density of the cosmic microwave background and the cosmic neutrino background  The Big Bang hypothesis  by contrast  predicts that the CBR should have the same energy density as the binding energy density of the primordial helium  which is much greater than the binding energy density of the non primordial elements  so it gives almost the same result  But  neglecting quantum fluctuations in the early universe  the Big Bang would also predict a uniform distribution of CBR  while the steady state model does not even predict its existence and cannot be modified to predict its temperature distribution accurately   4 2  Finite age of stars  Stars have a finite age and a finite power  thereby implying that each star has a finite impact on a sky s light field density  Edgar Allan Poe suggested that this idea could provide a resolution to Olbers  paradox  a related theory was also proposed by Jean Philippe de Chéseaux  However  stars are continually being born as well as dying  As long as the density of stars throughout the universe remains constant  regardless of whether the universe itself has a finite or infinite age  there would be infinitely many other stars in the same angular direction  with an infinite total impact  So the finite age of the stars does not explain the paradox   4 3  Brightness  Suppose that the universe were not expanding  and always had the same stellar density  then the temperature of the universe would continually increase as the stars put out more radiation  Eventually  it would reach 3000 K  corresponding to a typical photon energy of 0 3 eV and so a frequency of 7 5×1013 Hz   and the photons would begin to be absorbed by the hydrogen plasma filling most of the universe  rendering outer space opaque  This maximal radiation density corresponds to about eV m3     which is much greater than the observed value of   So the sky is about fifty billion times darker than it would be if the universe were neither expanding nor too young to have reached equilibrium yet   4 4  Fractal star distribution  A different resolution  which does not rely on the Big Bang theory  was first proposed by Carl Charlier in 1908 and later rediscovered by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1974  They both postulated that if the stars in the universe were distributed in a hierarchical fractal cosmology  e g   similar to Cantor dust —the average density of any region diminishes as the region considered increases—it would not be necessary to rely on the Big Bang theory to explain Olbers  paradox  This model would not rule out a Big Bang but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred   Mathematically  the light received from stars as a function of star distance in a hypothetical fractal cosmos is   where   r0   the distance of the nearest star  r0   0   r   the variable measuring distance from the Earth   L r    average luminosity per star at distance r   N r    number of stars at distance r   The function of luminosity from a given distance L r N r  determines whether the light received is finite or infinite  For any luminosity from a given distance L r N r  proportional to ra  is infinite for a ≥ −1 but finite for a   −1  So if L r  is proportional to r−2  then for to be finite  N r  must be proportional to rb  where b   1  For b   1  the numbers of stars at a given radius is proportional to that radius  When integrated over the radius  this implies that for b   1  the total number of stars is proportional to r2  This would correspond to a fractal dimension of 2  Thus the fractal dimension of the universe would need to be less than 2 for this explanation to work   This explanation is not widely accepted among cosmologists since the evidence suggests that the fractal dimension of the universe is at least 2  Moreover  the majority of cosmologists accept the cosmological principle  which assumes that matter at the scale of billions of light years is distributed isotropically  Contrarily  fractal cosmology requires anisotropic matter distribution at the largest scales   5  See also  Heat death paradox  List of paradoxes  6  References  7  Further reading  Edward Robert Harrison  1987  Darkness at Night  A Riddle
