The rotary engine was an early type of internal combustion engine  usually designed with an odd number of cylinders per row in a radial configuration  in which the crankshaft remained stationary  with the entire crankcase and its attached cylinders rotating around it as a unit in operation  Its main application was in aviation  although it also saw use before its primary aviation role  in a few early motorcycles and automobiles   This type of engine was widely used as an alternative to conventional inline engines  straight or V  during World War I and the years immediately preceding that conflict  They have been described as  a very efficient solution to the problems of power output  weight  and reliability    By the early 1920s  however  the inherent limitations of this type of engine had rendered it obsolete  with the power output increasingly going into overcoming the air resistance of the spinning engine itself  The rotating mass of the engine also caused significant gyroscopic precession  depending on the type of aircraft  this produced stability and control problems  especially for inexperienced pilots  Another factor in the demise of the rotary was the fundamentally inefficient use of fuel and lubricating oil  caused in part by the need to aspirate the fuel air mixture through the hollow crankshaft and crankcase along with the lubricating medium  as in a two stroke engine   1  Description  A rotary engine is essentially a standard Otto cycle engine  but instead of having a fixed cylinder block with rotating crankshaft as with a conventional radial engine  the crankshaft remains stationary and the entire cylinder block rotates around it  In the most common form  the crankshaft was fixed solidly to the airframe  and the propeller was simply bolted to the front of the crankcase   Three key factors contributed to the rotary engine s success at the time   Smooth running  Rotaries delivered power very smoothly because  relative to the engine mounting point  there are no reciprocating parts  and the relatively large rotating mass of the cylinders acted as a flywheel   Weight advantage  many conventional engines had to have heavy flywheels added to smooth out power impulses and reduce vibration  Rotary engines gained a substantial power to weight ratio advantage by having no need for an added flywheel   Improved cooling  when the engine was running the rotating cylinder block created its own fast moving cooling airflow  even with the aircraft at rest  Most rotary engines were arranged with the cylinders pointing outwards from a single crankshaft  in the same general form as a radial  but there were also rotary boxer engines and even one cylinder rotaries   Like radial engines  rotaries were generally built with an odd number of cylinders  usually either 7 or 9   so that a consistent every other piston firing order could be maintained  to provide smooth running  Rotary engines with an even number of cylinders were mostly of the  two row  type   1 1  Distinction between  rotary  and  radial  engines  Rotary and radial engines look strikingly similar when they are not running and can easily be confused  since both have cylinders arranged radially around a central crankshaft  Unlike the rotary engine  however  radial engines use a conventional rotating crankshaft in a fixed engine block   2  Rotary engine control  2 1  Monosoupape rotaries  It is often asserted that rotary engines had no carburetor and hence power could only be reduced by intermittently cutting the ignition using a  blip  switch  This was literally true only of the  Monosoupape   single valve  type  which took the air supply in through the exhaust valve  and so could not be controlled via the crankcase intake  The  throttle   fuel valve  of a monosoupape therefore provided only a very limited degree of speed regulation  as opening it made the mixture too rich  while closing it made it too lean  in either case quickly stalling the engine  or damaging the cylinders   Early models featured a pioneering form of variable valve timing in an attempt to give greater control  but this caused the valves to burn and therefore it was abandoned   The only way of running a Monosoupape engine smoothly at reduced revs was with a switch that changed the normal firing sequence so that each cylinder fired only once per two or three engine revolutions  but the engine remained in perfect balance  As with excessive use of the  blip  switch  running the engine on such a setting for too long resulted in large quantities of unburned fuel and oil in the exhaust  and gathering in the lower cowling  where it was a notorious fire hazard   2 2   Normal  rotaries  Most rotaries however  had normal inlet valves  so that the fuel  and lubricating oil  was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air   as in a normal four stroke engine  Although a conventional carburetor  with the ability to keep the fuel air ratio constant over a range of throttle openings was precluded by the spinning cylinder block  it was possible to adjust the air supply through a separate flap valve or  bloctube   The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting  usually full open  and then adjust the fuel air mixture to suit using a separate  fine adjustment  lever that controlled the air supply valve  Due to the rotary engine s large rotational inertia  it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel air mixture by trial and error without stalling it  although this varied between different types of engine  and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary  knack   After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to idle  the air valve was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained   Throttling a running engine back to reduce revs was possible by closing off the fuel valve to the required position while re adjusting the fuel air mixture to suit  This process was also tricky  so that  throttling back   especially when landing  was often accomplished by intermittently cutting the ignition using the blip switch   Cutting cylinders using ignition switches had the drawback of letting fuel continue to pass through the engine  oiling up the spark plugs and preventing the engine from restarting  Also  the raw oil fuel mix could collect in the cowling  As this could cause a serious fire when the switch was released  it became common practice for part or all of the bottom of the basically circular cowling on most rotary engines to be cut away  or fitted with drainage slots   By 1918 a Clerget handbook advised maintaining all necessary control by using the fuel and air controls  and starting and stopping the engine by turning the fuel on and off  The recommended landing procedure involved shutting off the fuel using the fuel lever  while leaving the blip switch on  The windmilling propeller made the engine continue to spin without delivering any power as the aircraft descended  It was important to leave the ignition on to allow the spark plugs to continue to spark and keep them from oiling up  so that the engine could  if all went well  be restarted simply by re opening the fuel valve  Pilots were advised to not use an ignition cut out switch  as it would eventually damage the engine   Pilots of surviving or reproduction aircraft fitted with rotary engines still find  however  that the blip switch is useful while landing  as it provides a more reliable  quicker way to initiate power if needed  rather than risk a sudden engine stall  or failure of a windmilling engine to restart at the worst possible moment   3  History  3 1  Millet  Félix Millet showed a 5 cylinder rotary engine built into a bicycle wheel at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889  Millet had patented the engine in 1888  so must be considered the pioneer of the internal combustion rotary engine  A machine powered by his engine took part in the Paris Bordeaux Paris race of 1895 and the system was put into production by Darracq in 1900   3 2  Hargrave  Lawrence Hargrave first developed a rotary engine in 1889 using compressed air  intending to use it in powered flight  Materials weight and lack of quality machining prevented it becoming an effective power unit   3 3  Balzer  Stephen Balzer of New York  a former watchmaker  constructed rotary engines in the 1890s  He was interested in the rotary layout for two main reasons   To generate at the low rpm at which the engines of the day ran  the pulse resulting from each combustion stroke was quite large  To damp out these pulses  engines needed a large flywheel  which added weight  In the rotary design the engine acted as its own flywheel  thus rotaries could be lighter than similarly sized conventional engines   The cylinders had good cooling airflow over them  even when the aircraft was at rest—which was important  as the low airspeed of aircraft of the time provided limited cooling airflow  and alloys of the day were less advanced  Balzer s early designs even dispensed with cooling fins  though subsequent rotaries did have this common feature of air cooled engines  Balzer produced a 3 cylinder  rotary engined car in 1894  then later became involved in Langley s Aerodrome attempts  which bankrupted him while he tried to make much larger versions of his engines  Balzer s rotary engine was later converted to static radial operation by Langley s assistant  Charles M  Manly  creating the notable Manly Balzer engine   3 4  De Dion Bouton  The famous De Dion Bouton company produced an experimental 4 cylinder rotary engine in 1899  Though intended for aviation use  it was not fitted to any aircraft   3 5  Adams Farwell  The Adams Farwell firm s automobiles  with the firm s first rolling prototypes using 3 cylinder rotary engines designed by Fay Oliver Farwell in 1898  led to production Adams Farwell cars with first the 3 cylinder  then very shortly thereafter 5 cylinder rotary engines later in 1906  as another early American automaker utilizing rotary engines expressly manufactured for automotive use  Emil Berliner sponsored its development of the 5 cylinder Adams Farwell rotary engine design concept as a lightweight power unit for his unsuccessful helicopter experiments  Adams Farwell engines later powered fixed wing aircraft in the US after 1910  It has also been asserted that the Gnôme design was derived from the Adams Farwell  since an Adams Farwell car is reported to have been demonstrated to the French Army in 1904  In contrast to the later Gnôme engines  and much like the later Clerget 9B and Bentley BR1 aviation rotaries  the Adams Farwell rotaries had conventional exhaust and inlet valves mounted in the cylinder heads   3 6  Gnome  The Gnome engine was the work of the three Seguin brothers  Louis  Laurent and Augustin  They were talented engineers and the grandsons of famous French engineer Marc Seguin  In 1906 the eldest brother  Louis  had formed the Société des Moteurs Gnome to build stationary engines for industrial use  having licensed production of the Gnom single cylinder stationary engine from Motorenfabrik Oberursel—who  in turn  built licensed Gnome engines for German aircraft during World War I   Louis was joined by his brother Laurent who designed a rotary engine specifically for aircraft use  using Gnom engine cylinders  The brothers  first experimental engine is said to have been a 5 cylinder model that developed   and was a radial rather than rotary engine  but no photographs survive of the five cylinder experimental model  The Seguin brothers then turned to rotary engines in the interests of better cooling  and the world s first production rotary engine  the 7 cylinder  air cooled  Omega  was shown at the 1908 Paris automobile show  The first Gnome Omega built still exists  and is now in the collection of the Smithsonian s National Air and Space Museum  The Seguins used the highest strength material available   recently developed nickel steel alloy   and kept the weight down by machining components from solid metal  using the best American and German machine tools to create the engine s components  the cylinder wall of a 50 hp Gnome was only 1 5 mm thick  while the connecting rods were milled with deep central channels to reduce weight  While somewhat low powered in terms of horsepower per litre  its power to weight ratio was an outstanding per kg   The following year  1909  the inventor Roger Ravaud fitted one to his Aéroscaphe  a combination hydrofoil aircraft  which he entered in the motor boat and aviation contests at Monaco  However  Henry Farman s use of the Gnome at the famous Rheims aircraft meet that year brought it to prominence  when he won the Grand Prix for the greatest non stop distance flown——and also set a world record for endurance flight  The very first successful seaplane flight  of Henri Fabre s Le Canard  was powered by a Gnome Omega on March 28  1910 near Marseille   Production of Gnome rotaries increased rapidly  with some 4 000 being produced before World War I  and Gnome also produced a two row version  the 100 h p  Double Omega   the larger 70 hp Gnome Lambda and the 160 hp two row Double Lambda  By the standards of other engines of the period  the Gnome was considered not particularly temperamental  and was credited as the first engine able to run for ten hours between overhauls   In 1913 the Seguin brothers introduced the new Monosoupape   single valve   series  which replaced inlet valves in the pistons by using a single valve in each cylinder head  which doubled as inlet and exhaust valve  The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve tappet rollers  a system later abandoned due to valves burning  The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two valve engines  and it used less lubricating oil  The 100 hp Monosoupape was built with 9 cylinders  and developed its rated power at 1 200 rpm  The later 160 hp nine cylinder Gnome 9N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design  and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format   Rotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rhône companies used conventional pushrod operated valves in the cylinder head  but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft  with the Le Rhônes having prominent copper intake tubes running from the crankcase to the top of each cylinder to admit the intake charge   The 80 hp  60 kW  seven cylinder Gnome was the standard at the outbreak of World War I  as the Gnome Lambda  and it quickly found itself being used in a large number of aircraft designs  It was so good that it was licensed by a number of companies  including the German Motorenfabrik Oberursel firm who designed the original Gnom engine  Oberursel was later purchased by Fokker  whose 80 hp Gnome Lambda copy was known as the Oberursel U 0  It was not at all uncommon for French Gnomes  as used in the earliest examples of the Bristol Scout biplane  to meet German versions  powering Fokker E I Eindeckers  in combat  from the latter half of 1915 on   The only attempts to produce twin row rotary engines in any volume were undertaken by Gnome  with their Double Lambda fourteen cylinder 160 hp design  and with the German Oberursel firm s early World War I clone of the Double Lambda design  the U III of the same power rating  While an example of the Double Lambda went on to power one of the Deperdussin Monocoque racing aircraft to a world record speed of nearly 204 km h  126 mph  in September 1913  the Oberursel U III is only known to have been fitted into a few German production military aircraft  the Fokker E IV fighter monoplane and Fokker D III fighter biplane  both of whose failures to become successful combat types were partially due to the poor quality of the German powerplant  which was prone to wearing out after only a few hours of combat flight   4  World War I  The favourable power to weight ratio of the rotaries was their greatest advantage  While larger  heavier aircraft relied almost exclusively on conventional in line engines  many fighter aircraft designers preferred rotaries right up to the end of the war   Rotaries had a number of disadvantages  notably very high fuel consumption  partially because the engine was typically run at full throttle  and also because the valve timing was often less than ideal  Oil consumption was also very high  Due to primitive carburetion and absence of a true sump  the lubricating oil was added to the fuel air mixture  This made engine fumes heavy with smoke from partially burnt oil  Castor oil was the lubricant of choice  as its lubrication properties were unaffected by the presence of the fuel  and its gum forming tendency was irrelevant in a total loss lubrication system  An unfortunate side effect was that World War I pilots inhaled and swallowed a considerable amount of the oil during flight  leading to persistent diarrhoea  Flying clothing worn by rotary engine pilots was routinely soaked with oil   The rotating mass of the engine also made it  in effect  a large gyroscope  During level flight the effect was not especially apparent  however  when turning  the gyroscopic precession became noticeable  Due to the direction of the engine s rotation  left turns required effort and happened relatively slowly  combined with a tendency to nose up  while right turns were almost instantaneous  with a tendency for the nose to drop  In some aircraft  this could be advantageous in situations such as dogfights  The Sopwith Camel suffered to such an extent that it required left rudder for both left and right turns  and could be extremely hazardous if the pilot applied full power at the top of a loop at low airspeeds  Trainee Camel pilots were warned to attempt their first hard right turns only at altitudes above   The Camel s most famous German foe  the Fokker Dr I triplane  also used a rotary engine  usually the Oberursel Ur II clone of the French built Le Rhone 9J 110 hp powerplant   Even before the First World War  attempts were made to overcome the inertia problem of rotary engines  As early as 1906 Charles Benjamin Redrup had demonstrated to the Royal Flying Corps at Hendon a  Reactionless  engine in which the crankshaft rotated in one direction and the cylinder block in the opposite direction  each one driving a propeller  A later development of this was the 1914 reactionless  Hart  engine designed by Redrup in which there was only one propeller connected to the crankshaft  but it rotated in the opposite direction to the cylinder block  thereby largely cancelling out negative effects  This proved too complicated for reliable operation and Redrup changed the design to a static radial engine  which was later tried in the experimental Vickers F B 12b and F B 16 aircraft  unfortunately without success   As the war progressed  aircraft designers demanded ever increasing amounts of power  Inline engines were able to meet this demand by improving their upper rev limits  which meant more power  Improvements in valve timing  ignition systems  and lightweight materials made these higher revs possible  and by the end of the war the average engine had increased from 1 200 rpm to 2 000  The rotary was not able to do the same due to the drag of the rotating cylinders through the air  For instance  if an early war model of 1 200 rpm increased its revs to only 1 400  the drag on the cylinders increased 36%  as air drag increases with the square of velocity  At lower rpm  drag could simply be ignored  but as the rev count rose  the rotary was putting more and more power into spinning the engine  with less remaining to provide useful thrust through the propeller   One clever attempt to rescue the design  in a similar manner to Redrup s British  reactionless  engine concept  was made by Siemens AG  The crankcase  with the propeller still fastened directly to the front of it  and cylinders spun counterclockwise at 900 rpm  as seen externally from a  nose on  viewpoint  while the crankshaft and other internal parts spun clockwise at the same speed  so the set was effectively running at 1800 rpm  This was achieved by the use of bevel gearing at the rear of the crankcase  resulting in the eleven cylindered Siemens Halske Sh III  with less drag and less net torque  Used on several late war types  notably the Siemens Schuckert D IV fighter  the new engine’s low running speed  coupled with large  coarse pitched propellers that sometimes had four blades  as the SSW D IV used   gave types powered by it outstanding rates of climb  with some examples of the late production Sh IIIa powerplant even said to be delivering as much as 240 hp   One new rotary powered aircraft  Fokker s own D VIII  was designed at least in part to provide some use for the Oberursel factory s backlog of otherwise redundant Ur II engines  themselves clones of the Le Rhône 9J rotary   Because of the Allied blockade of shipping  the Germans were increasingly unable to obtain from India the castor oil necessary to properly lubricate their rotary engines  Substitutes were never entirely satisfactory   causing increased running temperatures and reduced engine life   5  Postwar  By the time the war ended  the rotary engine had become obsolete  and it disappeared from use quite quickly  The British Royal Air Force probably used rotary engines for longer than most other operators  The RAF s standard post war fighter  the Sopwith Snipe  used the Bentley BR2 rotary as the most powerful  at some 230 hp  rotary engine ever built by the Allies of World War I  The standard RAF training aircraft of the early post war years  the 1914 origin Avro 504K  had a universal mounting to allow the use of several different types of low powered rotary  of which there was a large surplus supply  However  designers had to balance the cheapness of war surplus engines against their poor fuel efficiency and the operating expense of their total loss lubrication system   The first version of the 1921 Michel engine  an unusual opposed piston cam engine  was a rotary engine This was soon replaced by a very similar version  with the same cylinders and cam  but with the cylinders stationary and the cam track rotating in lieu of a crankshaft  A later version abandoned the cam altogether and used three coupled crankshafts   By the mid 1920s  rotaries had been more or less completely displaced even in British service  largely by the new generation of air cooled  stationary  radials such as the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar and Bristol Jupiter   The Swedish FVM Ö1 Tummelisa advanced training aircraft served until 1935 and was fitted with a Le Rhone Thulin 90hp rotary engine   6  Use in cars and motorcycles  Although rotary engines were mostly used in aircraft  a few cars and motorcycles were built with rotary engines  Perhaps the first was the Millet motorcycle of 1892  A famous motorcycle  winning many races  was the Megola  which had a rotary engine inside the front wheel  Another motorcycle with a rotary engine was Charles Redrup s 1912 Redrup Radial  which was a three cylinder 303 cc rotary engine fitted to a number of motorcycles by Redrup   In 1904 the Barry engine  also designed by Redrup  was built in Wales  a rotating 2 cylinder boxer engine weighing 6 5 kg was mounted inside a motorcycle frame   In the 1940s Cyril Pullin developed the Powerwheel  a wheel with a rotating one cylinder engine  clutch and drum brake inside the hub  but it never entered production   Cars with rotary engines were built by American companies Adams Farwell  Bailey  Balzer and Intrepid  amongst others   7  Other rotary engines  Besides the configuration described in this article with cylinders moving around a fixed crankshaft  several different engine designs are also called rotary engines  The most notable pistonless rotary engine  the Wankel rotary engine has been used by NSU in the Ro80 car  by Mazda in a variety of cars such as the RX series  and in some experimental aviation applications   In the late 1970s a concept engine called the Bricklin Turner Rotary Vee was tested  The Rotary Vee is similar in configuration to the elbow steam engine  Piston pairs connect as solid V shaped members  with each end floating in a pair of rotating cylinders clusters  The rotating cylinder cluster pairs are set with their axes at a wide V angle  The pistons in each cylinder cluster move parallel to each other instead of a radial direction  This engine design has not gone into production  The Rotary Vee was intended to power the Bricklin SV 1   8  See also  Petrol engine  Monosoupape engine  Manly Balzer engine  Nutating disc engine  Quasiturbine  Turbine  Wankel rotary engine  9
