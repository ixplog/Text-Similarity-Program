Mineralogy is a subject of geology specializing in the scientific study of chemistry  crystal structure  and physical  including optical  properties of minerals  Specific studies within mineralogy include the processes of mineral origin and formation  classification of minerals  their geographical distribution  as well as their utilization   1  History  Early writing on mineralogy  especially on gemstones  comes from ancient Babylonia  the ancient Greco Roman world  ancient and medieval China  and Sanskrit texts from ancient India and the ancient Islamic World  Books on the subject included the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder  which not only described many different minerals but also explained many of their properties  and Kitab al Jawahir  Book of Precious Stones  by Persian scientist Al Biruni  The German Renaissance specialist Georgius Agricola wrote works such as De re metallica  On Metals  1556  and De Natura Fossilium  On the Nature of Rocks  1546  which begin the scientific approach to the subject  Systematic scientific studies of minerals and rocks developed in post Renaissance Europe  The modern study of mineralogy was founded on the principles of crystallography  the origins of geometric crystallography  itself  can be traced back to the mineralogy practiced in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries  and to the microscopic study of rock sections with the invention of the microscope in the 17th century   2  Modern mineralogy  Historically  mineralogy was heavily concerned with taxonomy of the rock forming minerals  to this end  the International Mineralogical Association is an organization whose members represent mineralogists in individual countries  Its activities include managing the naming of minerals  via the Commission of New Minerals and Mineral Names   location of known minerals  etc  As of 2004 there are over 4 000 species of mineral recognized by the IMA  Of these  perhaps 150 can be called  common   another 50 are  occasional   and the rest are  rare  to  extremely rare    More recently  driven by advances in experimental technique  such as neutron diffraction  and available computational power  the latter of which has enabled extremely accurate atomic scale simulations of the behaviour of crystals  the science has branched out to consider more general problems in the fields of inorganic chemistry and solid state physics  It  however  retains a focus on the crystal structures commonly encountered in rock forming minerals  such as the perovskites  clay minerals and framework silicates   In particular  the field has made great advances in the understanding of the relationship between the atomic scale structure of minerals and their function  in nature  prominent examples would be accurate measurement and prediction of the elastic properties of minerals  which has led to new insight into seismological behaviour of rocks and depth related discontinuities in seismograms of the Earth s mantle  To this end  in their focus on the connection between atomic scale phenomena and macroscopic properties  the mineral sciences  as they are now commonly known  display perhaps more of an overlap with materials science than any other discipline   2 1  Physical mineralogy  Physical mineralogy is the specific focus on physical attributes of minerals  Description of physical attributes is the simplest way to identify  classify  and categorize minerals  and they include   crystal structure  crystal habit  twinning  cleavage  lustre  diaphaneity  color  streak  hardness  specific gravity  2 2  Chemical mineralogy  Chemical mineralogy focuses on the chemical composition of minerals in order to identify  classify  and categorize them  as well as a means to find beneficial uses from them  There are a few minerals which are classified as whole elements  including sulfur  copper  silver  and gold  yet the vast majority of minerals are chemical compounds  some more complex than others  In terms of major chemical divisions of minerals  most are placed within the isomorphous groups  which are based on analogous chemical composition and similar crystal forms  A good example of isomorphism classification would be the calcite group  containing the minerals calcite  magnesite  siderite  rhodochrosite  and smithsonite   2 3  Biomineralogy  Biomineralogy is a cross over field between mineralogy  paleontology and biology  It is the study of how plants and animals stabilize minerals under biological control  and the sequencing of mineral replacement of those minerals after deposition  It uses techniques from chemical mineralogy  especially isotopic studies  to determine such things as growth forms in living plants and animals as well as things like the original mineral content of fossils   2 4  Optical mineralogy  Optical mineralogy is a specific focus of mineralogy that applies sources of light as a means to identify and classify minerals  All minerals which are not part of the cubic system are double refracting  where ordinary light passing through them is broken up into two plane polarized rays that travel at different velocities and refracted at different angles  Mineral substances belonging to the cubic system contain only one index of refraction  Hexagonal and tetragonal mineral substances have two indices  while orthorhombic  monoclinic  and triclinic substances have three indices of refraction  With opaque ore minerals  reflected light from a microscope is needed for identification   2 5  Crystal structure  X rays are used to determine the atomic arrangements of minerals and so to identify and classify them  The arrangements of atoms define the crystal structures of the minerals  Some very fine grained minerals  such as clays  commonly can be identified most readily by their crystal structures  The structure of a mineral also offers a precise way of establishing isomorphism  With knowledge of atomic arrangements and compositions  one may deduce why minerals have specific physical properties  and one may calculate how those properties change with pressure and temperature   2 6  Formation environments  The environments of mineral formation and growth are highly varied  ranging from slow crystallization at the high temperatures and pressures of igneous melts deep within the Earth s crust to the low temperature precipitation from a saline brine at the Earth s surface   Various possible methods of formation include   sublimation from volcanic gases  deposition from aqueous solutions and hydrothermal brines  crystallization from an igneous magma or lava  recrystallization due to metamorphic processes and metasomatism  crystallization during diagenesis of sediments  formation by oxidation and weathering of rocks exposed to the atmosphere or within the soil environment   2 7  Descriptive mineralogy  Descriptive mineralogy summarizes results of studies performed on mineral substances  It is the scholarly and scientific method of recording the identification  classification  and categorization of minerals  their properties  and their uses  Classifications for descriptive mineralogy includes   native elements  sulfides  oxides and hydroxides  halides  carbonates  nitrates and borates  sulfates  chromates  molybdates and tungstates  phosphates  arsenates and vanadates  silicates  organic minerals  2 8  Determinative mineralogy  Determinative mineralogy is the actual scientific process of identifying minerals  through data gathering and conclusion  When new minerals are discovered  a standard procedure of scientific analysis is followed  including measures to identify a mineral s formula  its crystallographic data  its optical data  as well as the general physical attributes determined and listed   3  Uses  Minerals are essential to various needs within human society  such as minerals used as ores for essential components of metal products used in various commodities and machinery  essential components to building materials such as limestone  marble  granite  gravel  glass  plaster  cement  etc  Minerals are also used in fertilizers to enrich the growth of agricultural crops   3 1  Collecting  Mineral collecting is also a recreational study and collection hobby  with clubs and societies representing the field  Museums  such as the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Hall of Geology  Gems  and Minerals  the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County  the Natural History Museum  London  and the private Mim Mineral Museum in Beirut  Lebanon  have popular collections of mineral specimens on permanent display   4  See also  List of minerals   a simple list concentrating on minerals with Wikipedia articles   List
