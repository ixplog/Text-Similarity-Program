Trimix is a breathing gas  consisting of oxygen  helium and nitrogen  and is often used in deep commercial diving and during the deep phase of dives carried out using technical diving techniques   With a mixture of three gases it is possible to create mixes suitable for different depths or purposes by adjusting the proportions of each gas   The mixture of helium and oxygen with a 0% nitrogen content is generally known as Heliox  This is frequently used as a breathing gas in deep commercial diving operations  where it is often recycled to save the expensive helium component  Analysis of two component gases is much simpler than three component gases   1  Mixes  1 1  Advantages of helium in the mix  The main reason for adding helium to the breathing mix is to reduce the proportions of nitrogen and oxygen below those of air  to allow the gas mix to be breathed safely on deep dives  A lower proportion of nitrogen is required to reduce nitrogen narcosis and other physiological effects of the gas at depth  Helium has very little narcotic effect  A lower proportion of oxygen reduces the risk of oxygen toxicity on deep dives   The lower density of helium reduces breathing resistance at depth   Because of its low molecular weight  helium enters and leaves tissues more rapidly than nitrogen as the pressure is increased or reduced  this is called on gassing and off gassing   Because of its lower solubility  helium does not load tissues as heavily as nitrogen  but at the same time the tissues can not support as high an amount of helium when super saturated  In effect  helium is a faster gas to saturate and desaturate  which is a distinct advantage in saturation diving  but less so in bounce diving  where the increased rate of off gassing is largely counterbalanced by the equivalently increased rate of on gassing   1 2  Disadvantages of helium in the mix  Helium conducts heat six times faster than air  often helium breathing divers carry a separate supply of a different gas to inflate drysuits  This is to avoid the risk of hypothermia caused by using helium as inflator gas  Argon  carried in a small  separate tank  connected only to the inflator of the drysuit is preferred to air  since air conducts heat 50% faster than argon  Dry suits  if used together with a buoyancy compensator  still require a minimum of inflation to avoid  squeezing   i e  damage to skin caused by pressurizing dry suit folds   Some divers suffer from hyperbaric arthralgia  compression arthralgia  during descent   Helium dissolves into tissues more rapidly than nitrogen as the ambient pressure is increased  this is called on gassing   A consequence of the higher loading in some tissues is that many decompression algorithms require deeper decompression stops than a similar decompression dive using air  and helium is more likely to come out of solution and cause decompression sickness following a fast ascent   In addition to physiological disadvantages  the use of trimix also has economic and logistic disadvantages  The price of helium has increased by over 51% between the years 2000 and 2011  This price increase affects open circuit divers more than closed circuit divers due to the larger volume of helium consumed on a typical trimix dive  Additionally  as trimix fills require a more elaborate blending and compressor setup than less complex air and nitrox fills  there are fewer trimix filling stations  The relative scarcity of trimix filling stations may necessitate going far out of one s way in order to procure the necessary mix for a deep dive that requires the gas   1 3  Advantages of reducing oxygen in the mix  Lowering the oxygen content increases the maximum operating depth and duration of the dive before which oxygen toxicity becomes a limiting factor  Most trimix divers limit their working oxygen partial pressure  PO2  to 1 4 bar and may reduce the PO2 further to 1 3 bar or 1 2 bar depending on the depth  the duration and the kind of breathing system used  A maximum oxygen partial pressure of 1 4 bar for the active sectors of the dive  and 1 6 bar for decompression stops is recommended by several recreational and technical diving certification agencies for open circuit  and 1 2 bar or 1 3 bar as maximum for the active sectors of a dive on closed circuit rebreather   1 4  Advantages of keeping some nitrogen in the mix  Retaining nitrogen in trimix can contribute to the prevention of High Pressure Nervous Syndrome  a problem that can occur when breathing heliox at depths beyond about   Nitrogen is also much less expensive than helium   1 5  Naming conventions  Conventionally  the mix is named by its oxygen percentage  helium percentage and optionally the balance percentage  nitrogen  For example  a mix named  trimix 10 70  or trimix 10 70 20  consisting of 10% oxygen  70% helium  20% nitrogen is suitable for a dive   The ratio of gases in a particular mix is chosen to give a safe maximum operating depth and comfortable equivalent narcotic depth for the planned dive  Safe limits for mix of gases in trimix are generally accepted to be a maximum partial pressure of oxygen  PO2—see Dalton s law  of 1 0 to 1 6 bar and maximum equivalent narcotic depth of   At    12 52  has a PO2 of 1 3 bar and an equivalent narcotic depth of    In open circuit scuba  two classes of trimix are commonly used  normoxic trimix—with a minimum PO2 at the surface of 0 18 and hypoxic trimix—with a PO2 less than 0 18 at the surface  A normoxic mix such as  19 30  is used in the depth range  a hypoxic mix such as  10 50  is used for deeper diving  as a bottom gas only  and cannot safely be breathed at shallow depths where the PO2 is less than 0 18 bar   In fully closed circuit rebreathers that use trimix diluents  the mix can be hyperoxic in shallow water because the rebreather automatically adds oxygen to maintain a specific PO2  Less commonly  hyperoxic trimix is sometimes used on open circuit scuba  Hyperoxic trimix is sometimes referred to as Helitrox  TriOx  or HOTx  High Oxygen Trimix  with the  x  in HOTx representing the mixture s fraction of helium as a percentage   See breathing gas for more information on the composition and choice of gas blends   2  Blending  Gas blending of trimix involves decanting oxygen and helium into the diving cylinder and then topping up the mix with air from a diving air compressor  To ensure an accurate mix  after each helium and oxygen transfer  the mix is allowed to cool  its pressure is measured and further gas is decanted until the correct pressure is achieved  This process often takes hours and is sometimes spread over days at busy blending stations   A second method called  continuous blending  is now gaining favor  Oxygen  helium and air are blended on the intake side of a compressor  The oxygen and helium are fed into the air stream using flow meters  so as to achieve the rough mix  The low pressure mixture is analyzed for oxygen content and the oxygen and helium flows adjusted accordingly  On the high pressure side of the compressor a regulator is used to reduce pressure of a sample flow and the trimix is analyzed  preferably for both helium and oxygen  so that the fine adjustment to the intake gas flows can be made   The benefit of such a system is that the helium delivery tank pressure need not be as high as that used in the partial pressure method of blending and residual gas can be  topped up  to best mix after the dive  This is important mainly because of the high cost of helium   Drawbacks may be that the high heat of compression of helium results in the compressor overheating  especially in tropical climates  and that the hot trimix entering the analyzer on the high pressure side can affect the reliability of the analysis   DIY versions of the continuous blend units can be made for as little as $200  excluding analyzers    2 1   Standard  mixes  Although theoretically trimix can be blended with almost any combination of helium and oxygen  a number of  standard  mixes have evolved  such as 21 35  18 45 and 15 55—see Naming conventions   Most of these mixes originated from filling the cylinders with a certain percentage of helium  and then topping the mix with 32% enriched air nitrox  The  standard  mixes evolved because of three coinciding factors—the desire to keep that equivalent narcotic depth  END  of the mix at approximately   the requirement to keep the partial pressure of oxygen at 1 4 ATA or below at the deepest point of the dive  and the fact that many dive shops stored standard 32% enriched air nitrox in banks  which simplified mixing  The use of standard mixes makes it relatively easy to top up diving cylinders after a dive using residual mix—only helium and banked nitrox needs to be used to top up the residual gas from the last fill   The method of mixing a known nitrox mix with helium allows analysis of the fractions of each gas using only an oxygen analyser  since the ratio of the oxygen fraction in the final mix to the oxygen fraction in the initial nitrox gives the fraction of nitrox in the final mix  hence the fractions of the three components are easily calculated  It is demonstrably true that the END of a nitrox helium mixture at its maximum operating depth  MOD  is equal to the MOD of the nitrox alone   2 1 1  Heliair  Heliair is a breathing gas consisting of mixture of oxygen  nitrogen and helium and is often used during the deep phase of dives carried out using technical diving techniques  This term  first used by Sheck Exley  is mostly used by Technical Diving International   It is easily blended from helium and air and so has a fixed 21 79 ratio of oxygen to nitrogen with the balance consisting of a variable amount of helium  It is sometimes referred to as  poor man s trimix   because it is much easier to blend than trimix blends with variable oxygen content  since all that is required is to insert the requisite partial pressure of helium  and then top up with air from a conventional compressor  The more complicated  and dangerous  step of adding pure oxygen at pressure required to blend trimix is absent when blending heliair   Heliair blends are similar to the standard Trimix blends made with helium and Nitrox 32  but with a deeper END at MOD  Heliair will always have less than 21% oxygen  and will be hypoxic  less than 17% oxygen  for mixes with more than 20% helium   2 2  Hyperoxic trimix  The National Association of Underwater Instructors  NAUI  uses the term  helitrox  for hyperoxic 26 17 Trimix  i e  26% oxygen  17% helium  57% nitrogen  Helitrox requires decompression stops similar to Nitrox I  EAN32  and has a maximum operating depth of   where it has an equivalent narcotic depth of   This allows diving throughout the usual recreational range  while decreasing decompression obligation and narcotic effects compared to air   GUE and UTD also promote hyperoxic trimix  but prefer the term  TriOx    Other divers question whether this proliferation of terminology is useful  and feel that the term Trimix is sufficient  modified as appropriate with the terms hypoxic  normoxic and hyperoxic  and the usual forms for indicating constituent gas fraction   3  History as a diving gas   1919  Professor Elihu Thompson speculates that helium could be used instead of nitrogen to reduce the breathing resistance at great depth  The effects from narcosis was not proven until the salvage of the USS Squalus in 1939  Heliox was used with air tables resulting in a high incidence of decompression sickness so the use of helium was discontinued    1925  The US Navy begins examining helium s potential usage and by the mid 1920s lab animals were exposed to experimental chamber dives using heliox  Soon  human subjects breathing heliox 20 80  20% oxygen  80% helium  had been successfully decompressed from deep dives    1937  Several test dives are conducted with helium mixtures  including salvage diver Max
