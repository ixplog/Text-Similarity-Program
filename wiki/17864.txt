The Luddites were 19th century English textile artisans who protested against newly developed labour replacing machinery from 1811 to 1817  The stocking frames  spinning frames and power looms introduced during the Industrial Revolution threatened to replace the artisans with less skilled  low wage labourers  leaving them without work   Although the origin of the name Luddite    is uncertain  a popular theory is that the movement was named after Ned Ludd  a youth who allegedly smashed two stocking frames in 1779  and whose name had become emblematic of machine destroyers  The name evolved into the imaginary General Ludd or King Ludd  a figure who  like Robin Hood  was reputed to live in Sherwood Forest   1  Background  The movement can be seen as part of a rising tide of English working class discontent in the early 19th century  An agricultural variant of Luddism  centering on the breaking of threshing machines  occurred during the widespread Swing Riots of 1830 in southern and eastern England  The Luddittes  goal was to gain a better bargaining position with their employers  They were not afraid of technology per se  but were  labour strategists    Spasmodic rises in food prices provoked Keelmen in the port of Tyne to riot in 1710 and tin miners to plunder granaries at Falmouth in 1727  There was a rebellion in Northumberland and Durham in 1740  and manhandling of Quaker corn dealers in 1756  More peaceably  skilled artisans in the cloth  building  shipbuilding  printing and cutlery trades organised friendly societies to insure themselves against unemployment and sickness and sometimes  similar to guilds  against intrusion of  foreign  labour into their trades   The Luddite movement emerged during the harsh economic climate of the Napoleonic Wars  which saw a rise in difficult working conditions in the new textile factories  The movement began in Nottingham on 11 March 1811 and spread rapidly throughout England over the following two years  Handloom weavers burned mills and pieces of factory machinery   2  History  2 1  Luddite acts 1811–1813  The Luddites met at night on the moors surrounding industrial towns  where they would practise drills and manoeuvres  Their main areas of operation were Nottinghamshire in November 1811  followed by the West Riding of Yorkshire in early 1812 and Lancashire by March 1813  Luddites battled the British Army at Burton s Mill in Middleton and at Westhoughton Mill  both in Lancashire  Rumours abounded at the time that local magistrates employed agents provocateur to instigate the attacks  Using the pseudonym King Ludd  the Luddites and their supporters anonymously sent death threats to—and even attacked—magistrates and food merchants   2 2  Isolated incidents post 1814  Activists smashed Heathcote s lacemaking machine in Loughborough in 1816  He and other industrialists had secret chambers constructed in their buildings that could be used as hiding places during an attack   In 1817  an unemployed Nottingham stockinger and probable ex Luddite named Jeremiah Brandreth led the Pentrich Rising  which was a general uprising unrelated to machinery  but which could be viewed as the last major Luddite act   3  Government response  The British Army clashed with the Luddites on several occasions  At one time  more British soldiers were fighting the Luddites than were fighting Napoleon on the Iberian Peninsula  Three Luddites  led by George Mellor  ambushed and assassinated a mill owner named William Horsfall from Ottiwells Mill at Crosland Moor in Marsden  West Yorkshire  Horsfall had remarked that he would  Ride up to his saddle in Luddite blood   Mellor fired the fatal shot to Horsfall s groin  and all three men were arrested   The British government sought to suppress the Luddite movement with a mass trial at York in January 1813  following the attack on Cartwrights mill at Rawfolds near Cleckheaton  The government charged over sixty men  including Mellor and his companions  with various crimes in connection with Luddite activities  While some of those charged were actual Luddites  many had no connection to the movement  These trials were not legitimate judicial reckonings of each defendant s guilt  but show trials intended to deter other Luddites from continuing their activities  By meting out harsh consequences  including  in many cases  execution and penal transportation  the trials quickly ended the movement   Parliament subsequently made  machine breaking   i e  industrial sabotage  a capital crime with the Frame Breaking Act and the Malicious Damage Act  Lord Byron opposed this legislation  becoming one of the few prominent defenders of the Luddites after the treatment of the defendants at the York trials   Several decades later  in 1867  Karl Marx referred to the Luddites in Capital  Volume I  noting that it would be some time before workers were able to distinguish between the machines themselves and  the form of society which utilizes these instruments    4  In contemporary thought  The title Luddite developed a secondary meaning  a  Luddite  is a term describing those opposed to  or slow to adopt or incorporate into their lifestyle  industrialisation  automation  computerisation or new technologies in general  In 1956  there is a parliamentary speech that said  Organised workers were by no means wedded to a Luddite Philosophy    More recently  the term Neo Luddism has emerged to describe opposition to many forms of technology  According to a manifesto drawn up by the Second Luddite Congress  April 1996  Barnesville  Ohio   Neo Luddism is  a leaderless movement of passive resistance to consumerism and the increasingly bizarre and frightening technologies of the Computer Age    Economists apply the term  Luddite fallacy  to the notion that technological unemployment leads to structural unemployment  and is consequently macroeconomically injurious   If a technological innovation results in a reduction of necessary labour inputs in a given sector  then the industry wide cost of production falls  which lowers the competitive price and increases the equilibrium supply point which  theoretically  will require an increase in aggregate labour inputs   5  See also  Development criticism  Simple living  Technophobia  Turner Controversy – return to pre industrial methods
