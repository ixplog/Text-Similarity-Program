A vertical take off and landing  VTOL  aircraft is one that can hover  take off  and land vertically  This classification includes fixed wing aircraft as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors  such as cyclogyros cyclocopters and tiltrotors  Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well  such as CTOL  conventional take off and landing   STOL  short take off and landing   and or STOVL  short take off and vertical landing   Others  such as some helicopters  can only operate by VTOL  due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion  VTOL is a subset of V STOL  vertical and or short take off and landing    Besides the ubiquitous helicopter  there are currently two types of VTOL aircraft in military service  craft using a tiltrotor  such as the Bell Boeing V 22 Osprey  and aircraft using directed jet thrust such as the Harrier family  Generally speaking  VTOL aircraft capable of V STOL use it wherever possible  since it typically significantly increases takeoff weight  range or payload compared to pure VTOL   1  Rotorcraft  1 1  Helicopter  The helicopter s form of VTOL allows it to take off and land vertically  to hover  and to fly forwards  backwards  and laterally  These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed wing aircraft would usually not be able to take off or land  The capability to efficiently hover for extended periods of time is due to the helicopter s relatively long  and hence efficient rotor blades  and allows a helicopter to accomplish tasks that fixed wing aircraft and other forms of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft could not perform at least as well until 2011   On the other hand  the long rotor blades restrict the maximum speed to about 250 miles per hour of at least conventional helicopters  as retreating blade stall causes lateral instability   1 2  Autogyro  Autogyros are also known as Gyroplanes or Gyrocopters  The rotor is unpowered and rotates freely in the airflow as the craft travels forward  so the craft needs a conventional powerplant to provide thrust  An autogyro is not intrinsically capable of VTOL  for VTO the rotor must be spun up to speed by an auxiliary drive  and vertical landing requires precise control of rotor momentum and pitch   1 3  Gyrodyne  Gyrodynes are also known as Compound helicopters or Compound gyroplanes  A gyrodyne has the powered rotor of a helicopter with a separate forward thrust system of an autogyro  Apart from take off and landing the rotor may be unpowered and autorotate  Designs may also include stub wings for added lift   1 4  Cyclogyro  A cyclogyro or cyclocopter has a rotary wing whose axis and surfaces remain sideways across the airflow  as with a conventional wing   2  Powered lift  2 1  Convertiplane  A convertiplane takes off under rotor lift like a helicopter  then transitions to fixed wing lift in forward flight   2 1 1  Tiltrotor  A tiltrotor or proprotor tilts its propellers or rotors vertically for VTOL and then tilts them forwards for horizontal wing borne flight  while the main wing remains fixed in place   2 1 2  Tiltwing  A tiltwing has its propellers or rotors fixed to a conventional wing and tilts the whole assembly to transition between vertical and horizontal flight   2 2  Tail sitter  A tail sitter sits vertically on its tail for takeoff and landing  then tilts the whole aircraft forward for horizontal flight   2 3  Fan in wing  In the fan in wing configuration  a ducted fan is enclosed within the main wing shape  The craft takes off and land using fan lift  then transitions to wing borne lift in forward flight  The fans may or may not have covers which close over them in forward flight   2 4  Vectored thrust  Thrust vectoring is a technique used for jet and rocket engines  where the direction of the engine exhaust is varied  In VTOL  the exhaust can be varied between vertical and horizontal thrust   2 5  Lift jets  A lift jet is an auxiliary jet engine used to provide lift for VTOL operation  but may be shut down for normal wing borne flight   2 6  Lift via Coandă effect  Aircraft in which VTOL is achieved by exploiting the Coandă effect are capable of redirecting air much like thrust vectoring  but rather than routing airflow through a duct  the airflow is simply routed along an existing surface  which is usually the body of the craft allowing less material and weight  The VZ 9 AV Avrocar  or simply the VZ 9  was a Canadian VTOL aircraft developed by Avro Aircraft Ltd  which utilizes this phenomenon by blowing air into a central area  then it is directed down over the top surface  which is parabolic and resembles a bowed flying saucer  Due to the Coandă effect  the airflow is attracted to the nearest surface and continues to move along that surface despite the change in the surface s direction away from the airflow  The craft is designed to direct the airflow downward to provide lift   3  History  In addition to the helicopter  many approaches have been tried to develop practical aircraft with vertical take off and landing capabilities  Nikola Tesla patented a vertical take off and landing vehicle concept in 1928   In May 1951  both Lockheed and Convair were awarded contracts in the attempt to design  construct  and test two experimental VTOL fighters  Lockheed produced the XFV  and Convair producing the Convair XFY Pogo  nicknamed the  Pogo   Both experimental programs proceeded to flight status and completed test flights 1954–1955  when the contracts were cancelled  Similarly  the X 13 flew a series of test flights between 1955 and 1957  but also suffered the same fate   The use of vertical fans driven by engines was investigated in the 1950s  The US built an aircraft where the jet exhaust drove the fans  while British projects not built included fans driven by mechanical drives from the jet engines   NASA has flown other VTOL craft such as the Bell XV 15 research craft  1977   as have the Soviet Navy and Luftwaffe  Sikorsky tested an aircraft dubbed the X Wing  which took off in the manner of a helicopter  The rotors would become stationary in mid flight  and function as wings  providing lift in addition to the static wings  Boeing X 50 is a Canard Rotor Wing prototype that utilizes a similar concept   A different British VTOL project was the gyrodyne  where a rotor is powered during take off and landing but which then freewheels during flight  with separate propulsion engines providing forward thrust  Starting with the Fairey Gyrodyne  this type of aircraft later evolved into the much larger twin engined Fairey Rotodyne  that used tipjets to power the rotor on take off and landing but which then used two Napier Eland turboprops driving conventional propellers mounted on substantial wings to provide propulsion  the wings serving to unload the rotor during horizontal flight  The Rotodyne was developed to combine the efficiency of a fixed wing aircraft at cruise with the VTOL capability of a helicopter to provide short haul airliner service from city centres to airports   The CL 84 was a Canadian V STOL turbine tilt wing monoplane designed and manufactured by Canadair between 1964 and 1972  The Canadian government ordered three updated CL 84s for military evaluation in 1968  designated the CL 84 1  From 1972 to 1974  this version was demonstrated and evaluated in the United States aboard the aircraft carriers USS Guam and USS Guadalcanal  and at various other centres  These trials involved military pilots from the United States  the United Kingdom and Canada  During testing  two of the CL 84s crashed due to mechanical failures  but no loss of life occurred as a result of these accidents  No production contracts resulted   Although tiltrotors such as the Focke Achgelis Fa 269 of the mid 1940s and the Centro Técnico Aeroespacial  Convertiplano  of the 1950s reached testing or mock up stages  the V 22 Osprey is considered the world s first production tiltrotor aircraft  It has one three bladed proprotor  turboprop engine  and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip  The Osprey is a multi mission aircraft with both a vertical takeoff and landing  VTOL  and short takeoff and landing capability  STOL   It is designed to perform missions like a conventional helicopter with the long range  high speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft  The FAA classifies the Osprey as a model of powered lift aircraft   3 1  Jet lift  In 1947  Ryan X 13 Vertijet  a tailsitter design  was ordered by the US Navy  who then further issued a proposal in 1948 for an aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing  VTOL  aboard platforms mounted on the afterdecks of conventional ships  Both Convair and Lockheed competed for the contract but in 1950  the requirement was revised  with a call for a research aircraft capable of eventually evolving into a VTOL ship based convoy escort fighter   Another more influential early functional contribution to VTOL was Rolls Royce s Thrust Measuring Rig   flying bedstead   of 1953  This led to the first VTOL engines as used in the first British VTOL aircraft  the Short SC 1  1957  which used 4 vertical lift engines with a horizontal one for forward thrust   The Short SC 1 was the first British fixed wing VTOL aircraft  The SC 1 was designed to study the problems with VTOL flight and the transition to and from forward flight  The SC 1 was designed to meet a Ministry of Supply  MoS  request for tender  ER 143T  for a vertical take off research aircraft issued in September 1953  The design was accepted by the ministry and a contract was placed for two aircraft  XG900 and XG905  to meet Specification ER 143D dated 15 October 1954  The SC 1 was also equipped with the first  fly by wire  control system for a VTOL aircraft  This permitted three modes of control of the aerodynamic surfaces and or the nozzle controls   The Yakovlev Yak 38 was a Soviet Navy VTOL aircraft intended for use aboard their light carriers  cargoships  and capital ships  It was developed from the Yakovlev Yak 36 experimental aircraft in the 1970s  Before the Soviet Union broke up  a supersonic VTOL aircraft was developed as the Yak 38 s successor  the Yak 141  which never went into production   In the 1960s and early 1970s  Germany planned three different VTOL aircraft  One used the Lockheed F 104 Starfighter as a basis for research for a V STOL aircraft  Although two models  X1 and X2  were built  the project was canceled due to high costs and political problems as well as changed needs in the German Air Force and NATO  The EWR VJ 101C did perform free VTOL take offs and landings  as well as test flights beyond mach 1 in the mid  and late 60s  One of the test aircraft is preserved in the Deutsches Museum in Munich  Germany  The others were the VFW Fokker VAK 191B light fighter and reconnaissance aircraft  and the Dornier Do 31E 3  troop  transport   The LLRV was a spacecraft simulator for the Apollo lunar lander  It was designed to mimic the flight characteristics of the lunar module  LEM   which had to rely on a reaction engine to land on the Moon   The idea of using the same engine for vertical and horizontal flight by altering the path of the thrust led to the Bristol Siddeley Pegasus engine which used four rotating nozzles to direct thrust over a range of angles  This was developed side by side with an airframe  the Hawker P 1127  which became subsequently the Kestrel and then entered production as the Hawker Siddeley Harrier  though the supersonic Hawker Siddeley P 1154 was canceled in 1965  The French in competition with the P 1154 had developed a version of the Dassault Mirage III capable of attaining Mach 1  The Dassault Mirage IIIV achieved transition from vertical to horizontal flight in March 1966  reaching Mach 1 3 in level flight a short time later   3 2  V STOL  The Harrier is usually flown in STOVL mode  which enables it to carry a higher fuel or weapon load over a given distance   In V STOL the VTOL aircraft moves horizontally along the runway before taking off using vertical thrust  This gives aerodynamic lift as well as thrust lift and permits taking off with heavier loads and is more efficient   When landing the aircraft is much lighter due to the loss of propellant weight and a controlled vertical landing is possible   Now retired from British Royal Navy service  the Indian Navy operates Sea Harriers mainly from its aircraft carrier INS Viraat  The latest version of the Harrier  the BAE Harrier II has also been retired in December 2010  after being operated by the British Royal Air Force and Royal Navy  The United States Marine Corps  and the Italian and Spanish Navies use the AV 8B Harrier II  an equivalent derivative of the Harrier II  The Harrier II AV 8 will be replaced in the air arms of the US and UK by a STOVL variant of the Lockheed Martin F 35 Lightning II   4  Gallery  Image F 35 compilation ogg F 35 flight  transition to STOVL configuration  vertical take off  inflight re fueling  vertical hover and landing Image F 35 vertical landing ogg
