The MX 5  released as the MX 5 Miata in North America and as the Roadster in Japan  is a lightweight two seater roadster with a front engine  rear wheel drive layout  Manufactured by Mazda in Hiroshima  Japan  the model debuted in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show  The MX 5 was conceived as a small roadster 舑 with light weight and minimal mechanical complexity limited only by legal and safety requirements  technologically modern and reliable  The MX 5 is conceptually an evolution of the small British and Italian sports roadsters of the 1960s such as the Triumph Spitfire  MG MGB  Datsun 2000  Fiat 124 Sport Spider  Alfa Romeo Spider  and particularly the Lotus Elan   The second generation MX 5  NB  was launched in 1998  the third generation  NC  model was launched in 2005  and a fourth generation  ND  was announced for Q3 2015  It continues to be the best selling two seat convertible sports car in history and by July 2014 over 940 000 MX 5s had been built and sold around the world  However  production of the MX 5 fell by 2013 to below 14 000 units  due to the world finance crisis in 2008  and the pre announcement in 2012 of the coming ND model   Since the launch of the third generation  Mazda consolidated worldwide marketing using the MX 5 name with the exception of the United States where it is marketed as the MX 5 Miata  The name Miata derives from Old High German for reward   1  Generations and overview  The MX5 s first generation  the NA  sold over 400 000 units from 1989 to 1997 舑 with a straight 4 engine to 1993  a engine thereafter  with a DE tuned 1 6 as a budget option in some markets  舑 recognizable by its pop up headlights  The second generation  NB  was introduced in 1999 with a slight increase in engine power  it can be recognized by the fixed headlights and the glass rear window  although first generation owners may opt for the glass window design when replacing the original top  The third generation  NC  was introduced in 2006 with a engine   Launched at a time when production of small roadsters had almost come to an end  the Alfa Romeo Spider was the only comparable volume model in production at the time of the MX 5 s launch  Just a decade earlier  a host of similar models — notably the MG B  Triumph TR7  Triumph Spitfire  and Fiat Spider — had been available   The body is a conventional  but light  unibody or monocoque construction  with  detachable  front and rear subframes  The MX 5 also incorporates a longitudinal truss  marketed as the Powerplant Frame  PPF   providing a rigid connection between the engine and differential  minimizing flex and contributing to responsive handling  Some MX 5s feature limited slip differentials and anti lock braking system  Traction control is an option available on NC models  The earlier cars weighed just over a ton  with engine power output usually   The later cars were heavier  with higher power engines   With an approximate 50 50 front rear weight balance  the car has nearly neutral handling  Inducing oversteer is easy and very controllable  thus making the MX 5 a popular choice for amateur and stock racing  including  in the US  the Sports Car Club of America s Solo2 autocross and Spec Miata race series  and in the UK  the championship   The MX 5 has won awards including Wheels Magazine  s Car of the Year for 1989 and 2005  Sports Car International s  best sports car of the 1990s  and  ten best sports cars of all time   2005–2006 Car of the Year Japan  and 2005 Australian Car of the Year  The Miata has also made Car and Driver magazine s annual Ten Best list 14 times  In their December 2009 issue  Grassroots Motorsports magazine named the Miata as the most important sports car built during the previous 25 years   In 2009  English automotive critic Jeremy Clarkson wrote   2  Design genesis  In 1976  Bob Hall  a journalist at Motor Trend magazine who was an expert in Japanese cars and fluent in the language  met Kenichi Yamamoto and Gai Arai  head of Research and Development at Mazda  Yamamoto and Gai Arai asked Hall what kind of car Mazda should make in the future   In 1981  Hall moved to a product planning position with Mazda USA and again met Yamamoto  now chairman of Mazda Motors  who remembered their conversation about a roadster and in 1982 gave Hall the go ahead to research the idea further  At this time Hall hired designer Mark Jordan to join the newly formed Mazda design studio in Southern California  There  Hall and Jordan collaborated on the parameters of the initial image  proportion and visualization of the  light weight sports  concept  In 1983  the idea turned concept was approved under the  Offline 55  program  an internal Mazda initiative that sought to change the way new models were developed  Thus  under head of project Masakatsu  the concept development was turned into a competition between the Mazda design teams in Tokyo and California   The Californian team proposed a front engine  rear wheel drive layout  codenamed Duo 101  in line with the British roadster ancestry  but their Japanese counterparts favored the more common front engine  front wheel drive layout or the rear mid engine  rear wheel drive layout   The first round of judging the competing designs was held in April 1984  with designs presented on paper only  The mid engined car appeared to offer favorable qualities  although it was known at the time that such a layout would struggle to meet the noise  vibration  and harshness  NVH  requirements of the project  It was only at the second round of the competition in August 1984  when full scale clay models were presented  that the Duo 101 won the competition and was selected as the basis for what would become the MX 5   The Duo 101  so named as either a soft top or hardtop could be used  incorporated many key stylistic cues inspired by the Lotus Elan  a 1960s roadster  including the door handles and grill opening  International Automotive Design  IAD  in Worthing  England was commissioned to develop a running prototype  codenamed V705  It was built with a fiberglass body  a engine from a Mazda Familia and components from a variety of early Mazda models  The V705 was completed in August 1985 and taken to the US where it rolled on the roads around Santa Barbara  California and got positive reactions   The project received final approval on 18 January 1986  The model s codename was changed to P729 as it moved into the production phase  under head of program Toshihiko Hirai  The task of constructing five engineering mules  more developed prototypes  was again allocated to IAD  which also conducted the first front and rear crash tests on the P729  While Tom Matano  Mark Jordan  Wu Huang Chin  Norman Garrett  and Koichi Hayashi worked on the final design  the project was moved to Japan for engineering and production details   By 1989  with a definitive model name now chosen  the MX 5  as in  Mazda Experiment   project number 5  was ready to be introduced to the world as a true lightweight sports car  weighing just    Although Mazda s concept was for the MX 5 to be an inexpensive sports car  at introduction the design met strong demand  with many dealers placing customers on pre order lists and several dealers across North America increasing the vehicle markup   2 1  Jinba ittai  Mazda used a design credo across the three generations of the MX5 s development  the phrase   which translates loosely into English as  rider  jin  horse  ba  as one body  ittai     With the first generation of the MX 5  the phrase was developed into five specific core design requirements   That the car would be as compact and as light as possible while meeting global safety requirements   That the cockpit would comfortably accommodate two full stature occupants with no wasted space   That the basic layout would continue with the original s front midship rear drive configuration with the engine positioned ahead of the driver but behind the front axle for 50 50 weight distribution   That all four wheels would be attached by wishbone or multi link suspension systems to maximize tire performance  road grip  and dynamic stability   And that a power plant frame would again provide a solid connection between the engine and rear mounted differential to sharpen throttle response   3  First generation  NA   The MX 5 was unveiled at the Chicago Auto Show on February 10  1989  with a price tag of US$14 000  The MX 5  with production code NA  was made available for delivery to buyers worldwide in the following dates  May 1989  as a 1990 model  in the US and Canada  September 1  1989 in Japan  and 1990 in Europe  An optional hardtop was made available at the same time  in sheet moulding compound  SMC   Demand initially outstripped production  fueled by enthusiastic press reviews   In Japan  the car was not badged as a Mazda  as the company was experimenting with the creation of different marques for deluxe models  similar to Nissan s Infiniti and Toyota s Lexus  both brands of which launched at the same time as the Miata   Instead  the Mazda MX 5 was sold as the Eunos Roadster in Japan  and was joined by the MX 3 AZ 3 Eunos Presso  based on Japanese Mazda dealerships    The body shell of the NA was all steel with a light weight aluminium hood  Overall dimensions were in length  in width  and in height  Without options  the NA weighed only   Drag coefficient was indicated as 0 38  Suspension was an independent double wishbone on all four wheels  with an anti roll bar at the front and rear  Four wheel disc brakes  ventilated at the front  were behind alloy wheels with 185 60HR14 radial tires  The base model came with stamped steel wheels from the then current 323 Protege  The original MX 5 came with a dual overhead cam inline four cylinder engine  producing at 6 800 rpm  and of torque at 5 500 rpm  The engine employs an electronic fuel injection system using a vane type air flow meter and an electronic ignition system with a crankshaft angle sensor instead of a distributor  This engine  codename B6ZE RS   was specifically designed for the MX 5 and featured a lightened crankshaft  flywheel  and aluminum sump with cooling fins   Standard transmission was 5 speed manual  In Japan and the US  an optional automatic transmission was also offered but proved to be unpopular  The Japanese and American markets also received an optional viscous limited slip rear differential  although it was only available for cars with a manual transmission  To achieve the low introductory price  the base model was stripped  It had steel wheels  manual steering  roll up windows  and no stereo or air conditioning  Power steering  air conditioning  and stereo were added as standard equipment in later years   The NA could reach in 8 1 seconds and had a top speed of although Japanese market Eunos models were limited to   This first generation of Miata  often referred to as the NA  included a special Limited Edition of 250 examples in 1991  produced in British Racing Green with the first use of tan interior  to celebrate the highly successful launch of the MX 5 in the UK  These have a numbered brass plaque on the dash above the glovebox and on the front of the Owners Book  and are fitted with alloy wheels from MSW  Mazda Sports Workshop  which are often mistaken for BBS s  but are entirely unique to this model  1500 LE  Limited Edition  cars were produced in 1993  This model featured red leather interior  upgraded stereo  Nardi shift knob  leather wrapped steering wheel  cruise  limited slip differential  power windows  power mirrors  power steering  air conditioning  BBS wheels  Bilstein shocks  front and rear spoilers  ABS brakes  stainless sill plates  and Harley style peanut tank door speaker trim  All 1993 LE cars came in black   For the 1994 model year  the first generation MX 5 was freshened with the introduction of the more powerful BP ZE engine  dual airbags and a limited slip differential in some markets  The chassis was substantially braced to meet new side impact standards  most visibly by adding a  track bar  between the seatbelt towers inside the car  but also to the front and rear subframes  Also  1994 and 1995 were the only years in which Mazda offered a light metallic blue paint  Laguna Blue Mica   making these cars rare collectors cars to some  1994 also saw the introduction of the  R  package  a sport themed package with Bilstein shocks and subtle underbody spoilers  in addition to the removal of unnecessary items such as power steering  No body style changes were made  however   The new engine produced   which was then increased to for the 1996 model year  The base weight increased to   Performance was improved slightly  the additional power being partly offset by the extra weight  In some markets such as Europe  the engine continued to be available as a lower cost option  but was detuned to   This lower powered model did not receive all the additional chassis bracing of the new   Japanese and US cars were fitted with an optional Torsen LSD  which was far more durable than the previous viscous differential   There were a number of trim levels and special editions available  determined by local Mazda marketing departments  In the US  the base model was offered for US$13 995 at launch and was very basic  with manual windows  steel wheels  and without A C or power steering  The  A Package  offered power steering  a leather wrapped steering wheel  aluminum alloy wheels and cassette stereo  The  B Package  added power windows  along with cruise control and headrest speakers  while the  C Package  included a tan interior and top and leather seats  The  R Package  was for racing  and the annual special editions were formalized as  M Editions   These included all of the luxury options from the  C Package  as well as special paint and  sometimes  special wheels  In the UK  to celebrate Mazda s 24 hours of Le Mans win  Mazda brought out a special edition of the MX 5  with the winner s color scheme  see Mazda 787B  and came equipped with BBR  Brodie Brittain Racing  turbo conversion  the car is one of the most sought after special edition cars of the MX 5s   The first generation MX 5 was phased out with the 1997 model year  with the exception of 400 limited edition Berkeley models sold only in the UK in 1999 to mark the end of the NA   with the final 1500 NAs produced for the US market being the  STO    Special Touring Option   versions   3 1  M2 special editions  A small range of Miata units were assembled by the M2 Incorporated  Founded in November 1991  M2  also known as  Mazda Too   was Mazda s new off line planning   niche house   Research & Development company back in the early  90s  The M2 Corp  employees had noble intentions — creating niche mobiles derived from Mazda s volume products  Although M2 s basic mission involved focusing on the  soft  aspects of vehicle design in an attempt to create more specifically targeted niche variants  the changes to the off line cars would go well beyond mere cosmetics   Heading the M2 operation was Mr  Masakatsu Kato  original father of the Miata  Eunos Roadster  in Japan  as well as creator of several Mazda concept vehicles  Kato san was assisted by Hirotaka Tachibana  development engineer responsible for the superb dynamics of the FC  second generation RX 7  and the NA Roadster  Miata MX 5   M2 Corp  was based out of Tokyo  Japan  M2 Corp was a 100% owned subsidiary of Mazda  and it was closed by Mazda in 1995  Mazda kept a similar program going with the Mazdaspeed vehicles  and then in the late  90s Mazdaspeed was absorbed into Mazda as a subsidiary company in Mazda Auto Tokyo  There were many types of M2 branded vehicles between 1991 and 1995  beginning with the 1001 up to the 1031 Cafe Racer  Dec 91    M2 1001 Cafe Roadster  Dec 91  Limited 1 300 M2 Corp  released the M2 1001 Roadster in December 1991  It was a special  Limited Production  Roadster variant that was a short production run of only 300 units  in a special Blue Black Mica Paint  with a sticker price of $26 000  Prospective buyers were required to show up in person at M2 s Tokyo headquarters to register for a lottery to place an order for this extremely limited Roadster   This upscale Eunos Roadster was M2 s first turn key  race ready offering  Here is a list of some of the goodies that made it so popular  functional front airdam with integrated fog lamps  vintage aero mirrors  4 point roll bar  vintage gauge cluster  fixed back bucket seats  polished 3 spoke steering wheel  stiffer suspension package with M2 specific rates  polished aluminum strut brace  upgraded exhaust by HKS  intake system  1 6L motor with new aggressive pistons  upgraded camshaft  lightweight flywheel  LSD cooling intake  manual steering  manual windows  A C was optional   racing pedals  centerless console with matching shortened radio bezel  aluminum gas filler cap  a more aggressive wheel & tire package  15  x 6  Panasport rims   and a rear spoiler  which became standard for the R package   The performance changes made to the Roadster would bump the power to @ 7 000 rpm  and of torque @ 5 500 rpm  Once released  it proved so popular that people were paying up to $35 000 for one   M2 1002 Vintage Roadster  Nov 92  Limited 1 300 M2 CORP released its second Roadster in late 1992  with a sightly different front bumper but all the same items as the previous 1001 Roadster  This one did not do as well as the 1001   M2 1028 Street Competition Roadster  Feb 94  Limited 1 300 M2 CORP released its third Roadster in early 1994  based on the original  Jinba Ittai  concept made by Toshihiko Hirai  This was billed as a track ready Roadster   The US saw a cheaper version known as the R Package   Offered in Chaste White or Brilliant Black only  this Roadster used the new 1 8L powerplant with upgraded pistons  camshafts  and other similar goodies as the previous 1001 and 1002  This Roadster had an output of close to   and included 14  Eunos Factory Rims with a unique gunmetal paint with polished lip  The only real changes were a new set of lightweight side mirrors  MOMO Steering Wheel  Centerless console  racing seats  racing tow hook  a set of lower lip spoilers  R Package   and a newly designed  Duck Tail  trunk lid with integrated spoiler  The M2 1028 trunk lid was made from aluminum and weighed only   a very light weight from the original lid of   It also came with a 6 point roll cage  but no soft top  instead featuring a tarp that stretched over the cage  With optional FRP Hardtop with plexiglass rear window for more weight savings coming in at only    3 2  BBR MX 5 Turbo  Brodie Britain Racing  BBR  of Brackley  United Kingdom  have had a long history of involvement with the first generation  NA  cars in the UK  having supplied parts and equipment for a dealer supplied BBR Turbo version of the car between 1990 and 1991  This raised power output to   and produced of torque  The kit comprised 68 parts and was covered by a full dealer warranty  They were supplied and fitted to around 750 UK spec cars  including for the 1991  Le Mans  special edition  with a further 150 kits being supplied overseas   Two decades later in 2011  BBR now offer a turn key refurbishment package for old NA MX 5 s  again including a turbo charger kit  This now increases power output to   and produces of torque  The estimated top speed is now   with 0 60 approached in 5 5 seconds  The turbo charger used is the Garrett GT25 ball race unit  and the package also includes an air to air intercooler  and a digital piggy back ECU to control timing  fueling  and boost pressures  Subject to a satisfactory donor car  the refurbishment and turbo upgrade package includes rust treatment  a paint respray  new seats  wheels  and other trim  As of January 2011 the cost for a  refreshed  BBR MX 5 Turbo is £7 500   3 3  Technical specifications  UK   4  Second generation  NB   The redesigned MX 5 was previewed at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 1997  In February 1998  Mazda released the second generation MX 5  production code NB  for the 1999 model year  The NB featured a more powerful engine and external styling cues borrowed from the third generation Mazda RX 7 model  designed in 1995 by Tom Matano  Prices in the United States  the main market for the MX 5  started at US$19 770   Although many parts of the interior and body were different  the most notable changes were the headlamps  the first generation s retractable headlamps no longer passed pedestrian safety tests and were replaced by fixed ones  The new car grew slightly in width compared to the earlier model  its dimensions were  length   width   height and wheelbase   Without options  the NB weighed 1000 kg  2300 lb   The new generation was slightly more aerodynamic than the original  with a Cd figure of 0 36   The NB continued to employ four wheel independent suspension  with enlarged anti roll bars at the front and rear  but the wheels  tires and brakes were significantly upgraded  anti lock braking system was offered as an option  alloy wheels were now or in diameter and in width  depending on the trim package  sports models were equipped with the larger wheels and 195 50VR15 tires   The BP 4W engine remained at but received several minor updates  The engine compression ratio was raised from 9 0 1 to 9 5 1 by adding slightly domed pistons  the intake cam was changed to a solid lifter design with a stronger cam  the intake runners in the head were straightened and the intake manifold was mounted higher up  Mazda s Variable Intake Control System was introduced  which effectively gave a long narrow intake manifold at low rpm for better swirl  changing to a short  free flowing manifold at high rpm for maximum breathing  Power output of the new engine was quoted at with of torque   The B6 engine remained available in Europe and Japan  The base model NB could reach in 7 8 s and had a top speed of    4 1  MX 5 10th Anniversary Model  1999   In 1999  Mazda celebrated the 10th anniversary of the MX 5 with the 10th Anniversary Model  a limited edition featuring some until then exclusive features  namely a six speed transmission and Bilstein shock absorbers  performance figures were slightly different  with slower acceleration but higher top speed than the standard 5 speed model  The model s nickname among owners and enthusiasts was 10AM or 10AE  as in  10th Anniversary Edition    The car had a unique sapphire blue mica  called innocent blue in Japan  paint colour with two toned black leather and blue alcantara seats  The addition of the sixth gear resulted in different performance results  with 0– in 7 6 seconds  0 3 seconds faster than the standard 5 speed model  according to Car and Driver  and 0 4 seconds faster according to Motor Trend  However  in spite of the 10AM s greater weight  its top rated speed increased from   Combined fuel consumption improved from    Each car was sequentially numbered on a badge on the driver side front quarter panel  A  Certificate of Authenticity  with the same number came with each car  signed by Mazda President James E  Miller and dated 10 February 1999  On certain markets  a gift set was also included  consisting of a 1 24 scale diecast model  two Seiko branded wristwatches  his and hers  with matching blue faceplate and Miata logo  and metal keychain in the form of the Miata logo  all encased in a luxury blue velvet box  Despite the publicity that Mazda gave to this model  it took more than a year to sell all units  drawing criticism that too many units had been produced  another factor was the high price with an MSRP of $26 875  about $6500 more than a base model   For comparison  there were 3 500 units of the NC s 3rd Generation Limited launch model in 2005  and regular limited editions produced each year do not usually exceed 1 500 units per region  The polished wheels are notorious for corroding once the thin lacquer coating is damaged  Mazda replaced thousands of sets under warranty  There were minor differences in specification according to the market  such as no sports appearance package  front side back skirts  rear wing  or air conditioning for Europe   7 500 units of the 10th Anniversary were produced  with 3 700 distributed to Europe  of which  600   UK  20   Portugal   3 150 to North America  of which 3 000 to US and 150 to Canada   500 to Japan and 150 to Australia  Car number 7 500 was sold in the UK   4 2  Facelift  2001   For the 2001 model year  a facelift to the second generation MX 5 was released  There were some minor exterior changes  with a press release of July 18  2000  announcing the changes as  resulting in an even sportier and more forceful look   Fog lamps  previously an option  were made standard  Some cockpit elements were changed  with the instrument panel gauges receiving a white face and red numbers  The seats were also upgraded  incorporating more support in the side bolsters and taller headrests  Added for top models  designated  Sport  in the U K  were wheels with 205 45VR16 low profile tires  larger brakes at the front and rear  additional chassis stiffening braces  a limited slip differential  a 6 speed manual gearbox  Bilstein suspension and leather seats  The upgraded tires and suspension allowed the new model to pull 0 91 g in lateral grip in tests by Car and Driver magazine  The body was strengthened  gaining 16% in bending rigidity and 22% in torsional rigidity  With the minimum of options  the 2001 model weighed    The BP Z3 engine was slightly modified and now featured variable valve timing on the intake camshaft  The intake and exhaust system also received a minor upgrade  These modifications resulted in a power output of  Japan  UK and Australia  or  US only   In the United States  Mazda erroneously quoted the power figure for the Japanese and Australian model in early catalogues  Car and Driver magazine and numerous owners confirmed the missing power  and Mazda offered to buy back the 2001 cars due to those misleading power claims  Owners who did not take up the buy back offer were offered an apology and free servicing for the warranty period   2002 saw the launch of the MX5 SP  The MX 5 SP was developed and sold in Australia and its turbocharged engine produced at 6800 rpm  Only 100 of these cars were built  The SP was very expensive in comparison to a standard MX5 at the time but offered blistering performance  It has fast become a cult classic and sought after model in Australia   In 2003 Mazda launched a campaign to target a younger group of drivers with the introduction of the Shinsen Version  SV  Miata  The Shinsen  Japanese for  Fresh and New   provided an intermediate step between the base model and the pricier LS  Equipped with most standard features on the LS  such as cruise control and aluminum brush trim  This limited production model also shared an inverted color scheme of the same year Special Edition with a titanium silver exterior and dark blue top and interior   Also in 2003  a division of Mazda in Japan released the Roadster Coupé  with a fixed hardtop roof  The body structure was reworked to incorporate the roof and gave a substantial increase in chassis rigidity with a weight increase of   Production was limited to 179 units for Japan only  This was to become one of the rarest forms of the MX 5   4 3  Mazdaspeed MX 5  2004–2005   The 2004 model year saw the introduction of the official turbocharged Mazdaspeed MX 5  Roadster Turbo in Japan  It featured an IHI RHF5 VJ35 turbocharger equipped variant of the BP 4W engine that produced at 6000 rpm with a front mounted air to air intercooler  The Mazdaspeed could reach in 6 2 seconds but had a top speed of only due to its low 6 500 rev limiter  With its upgraded suspension and wider tires  the Mazdaspeed model could pull over 0 98 g in lateral grip  Other features included upgraded 6 speed transmission and clutch assemblies  upgraded drivetrain components  Racing Hart alloy wheels  special interior trim  The 2004 Mazdaspeed MX 5 was only available in Velocity Red Mica and Titanium Gray Metallic for the US market and Velocity Red Mica for the Canadian market while the 2005 model was available additionally in Lava Orange Mica and Black Mica in the US market  with Canada receiving only Titanium Grey Mica  Of the 5 428 Mazdaspeed MX 5s produced during model years 2004 and 2005  4 000 were produced in 2004  the 2005 production run was shortened to only 1428  due to a fire at the production facility  This model was also marketed in Australia as an MX 5 SE without any Mazdaspeed branding  exhaust tip excluded   featured 3 63 diff gears and was available in Sunlight Silver as well as Velocity Red Mica  Titanium Gray Metallic and Black Mica for 2005  It was also slightly detuned with only   Boost pressure was for Australian model vs of the North American and Japanese models which is the main contributor to the power difference  The MX 5 SE has been used for both gravel and tarmac rallying in Australia  showing the versatility of these cars in racing   4 4  Technical specifications  UK   4 5  Safety  The EuroNCAP Safety Ratings for MX 5s manufactured in 2002 were given 4 out of 5 stars for adult protection but only 1 out of 4 stars for pedestrian protection  EuroNCAP stated  This is a poor performance despite the MX 5 benefiting from not having to have the leading edge of its bonnet tested because of its low profile    5  Third generation  NC   Production of the third generation MX 5  code NC  began May 17  2005  for delivery in August  for the 2006 model year  This was partially due to the declining sales of the MX 5 during its second generation run  At its introduction in 2005  it won the Car of the Year Japan Award   The exterior styling  done by Yasushi Nakamuta until 2003  resembles the original design  but unlike the update from NA to NB  which was mostly a nose tail interior change  the NC shares no components with the NB  except for the side panel turning lights on non US models  The lead stylist of this model generation was Moray Callum   With the third generation  the suspension changed from a 4 wheel double wishbone setup to a front wishbone rear multilink setup  Technologies like traction control and stability control were added to increase driveability  According to Car and Driver  the NC has a skidpad number of 0 90g   For the US  the engine is the new 16 valve  MZR I4  producing and coupled to either a 5 speed or a 6 speed manual transmission or with the optional 6 speed automatic transmission  A limited slip differential is available with the 6 speed option  In Australia the MZR is offered  rated at and and the 6 speed transmission and LSD are standard  In Europe  two engines are offered  the MZR rated at and   coupled to the 6 speed manual transmission  and a new MZR  rated at and   coupled to the 5 speed manual transmission   A six speed automatic transmission  with steering wheel mounted paddle shifters  is optional  A test by Car and Driver magazine revealed a 0  time of 6 5 s for the U S  spec NC  Manufacturer figures for the European spec model are  0  in 9 4 s    and 7 9 s     In Japan  this generation no longer complies with Japanese government regulations concerning vehicle exterior width dimensions  and buyers in Japan are now liable for additional costs for ownership   The NC was launched with a special edition called  3rd Generation Limited  which featured added chrome accents and special wheels  3500 were built worldwide  300 in the UK  750 in the US  150 in Canada   delivered in advance of standard models   In July 2006  Mazda debuted a coupé convertible version of the NC with a three piece folding hardtop  named  MX 5 Roadster Coupe  in Europe   Roadster Power Retractable Hard Top  in Japan  and  MX 5 Miata Power Retractable Hard Top  in Canada and the US  The hardtop adds to the weight of a comparably equipped soft top  without diminishing trunk space when retracted  Constructed of polycarbonate  the top requires 12 seconds to raise or lower  and the first models were delivered to customers in late August 2006  Performance times are slightly affected with the weight increase  to 9 6 s    and 8 2 s    from 0   but top speed is increased from 196 km h  121 8 mph  to 200 km h  124 3 mph     and from to     for the European
