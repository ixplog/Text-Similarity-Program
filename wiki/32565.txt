Sildenafil  sold as Viagra and other trade names  is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension  Its use for sexual dysfunction in women is not clear   Common side effects include headaches and heart burn  as well as flushed skin  Caution is advised in those who have cardiovascular disease  Rare but serious side effects include prolonged erections  which can lead to damage to the penis  and sudden onset hearing loss  Sildenafil should not be taken by people who take nitrates such as nitroglycerin  as this may result in a severe and potentially fatal drop in blood pressure   It acts by inhibiting cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5  PDE5   an enzyme that promotes degradation of cGMP  which regulates blood flow in the penis   It was originally discovered by Pfizer scientists Andrew Bell  David Brown  and Nicholas Terrett  Since becoming available in 1998  sildenafil has been a common treatment for erectile dysfunction  its primary competitors are tadalafil  Cialis  and vardenafil  Levitra    1  Medical uses  1 1  Sexual dysfunction  The primary indication of sildenafil is treatment of erectile dysfunction  inability to sustain a satisfactory erection to complete intercourse   Its use is now standard treatment for erectile dysfunction including diabetes   1 2  Pulmonary hypertension  As well as erectile dysfunction  sildenafil citrate is also effective in the rare disease pulmonary arterial hypertension  It relaxes the arterial wall  leading to decreased pulmonary arterial resistance and pressure  This  in turn  reduces the workload of the right ventricle of the heart and improves symptoms of right sided heart failure  Because PDE5 is primarily distributed within the arterial wall smooth muscle of the lungs and penis  sildenafil acts selectively in both these areas without inducing vasodilation in other areas of the body  Pfizer submitted an additional registration for sildenafil to the United States Food and Drug Administration  FDA   and sildenafil was approved for this indication in June 2005  The preparation is named Revatio  to avoid confusion with Viagra  and the 20 mg tablets are white and round  Sildenafil joins bosentan and prostacyclin based therapies for this condition   2  Research  2 1  Antidepressant associated sexual dysfunction  People on antidepressants may experience sexual dysfunction  either as a result of their illness or as a result of their treatment  A 2003 study concluded sildenafil improved sexual function in men in this situation  Following up reports from 1999  the same researchers concluded sildenafil improved sexual function in female patients on antidepressants  as well   2 2  Altitude sickness  Sildenafil may be useful for the prevention and treatment of high altitude pulmonary edema associated with altitude sickness such as that suffered by mountain climbers   3  Adverse effects  In clinical trials  the most common adverse effects of sildenafil use included headache  flushing  dyspepsia  nasal congestion  and impaired vision  including photophobia and blurred vision  Some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue  cyanopsia   Some complained of blurriness and loss of peripheral vision  In July 2005  the FDA found that sildenafil could lead to vision impairment in rare cases and a number of studies have linked sildenafil use with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy  Rare but serious adverse effects found through postmarketing surveillance include priapism  severe hypotension  myocardial infarction  heart attack   ventricular arrhythmias  stroke  increased intraocular pressure  and sudden hearing loss  In October 2007  the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors  including sildenafil  required a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss   3 1  Interactions  Care should be exercised by patients who are also taking protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV  Protease inhibitors inhibit the metabolism of sildenafil  effectively multiplying the plasma levels of sildenafil  increasing the incidence and severity of side effects  Patients using protease inhibitors are recommended to limit their use of sildenafil to no more than one 25 mg dose every 48 hours  Other drugs that interfere with the metabolism of sildenafil include erythromycin and cimetidine  both of which can also lead to prolonged plasma half life levels   Concomitant use of sildenafil and an alpha blocker may lead to low blood pressure  but this effect does not occur if they are taken at least four hours apart   3 2  Contraindications  Contraindications include   When taking nitric oxide donors  organic nitrites and nitrates  such as glyceryl trinitrate  nitroglycerin   sodium nitroprusside  amyl nitrite   poppers    In men for whom sexual intercourse is inadvisable due to cardiovascular risk factors  Severe hepatic impairment  decreased liver function   Severe impairment in renal function  Hypotension  low blood pressure   Recent stroke or heart attack  Hereditary degenerative retinal disorders  including genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases   4  Nonmedical use  4 1  Recreational use  Sildenafil s popularity with young adults has increased over the years  Sildenafil s trade name  Viagra  is widely recognized in popular culture  and the drug s association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use  The reasons behind such use include the belief that the drug increases libido  improves sexual performance  or permanently increases penis size  Studies on the effects of viagra when used recreationally are limited  but suggest it has little effect when used by those not suffering from erectile dysfunction  In one study  a 25 mg dose was shown to cause no significant change in erectile quality  but did reduce the postejaculatory refractory time  This study also noted a significant placebo effect in the control group   Unprescribed recreational use of sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors is noted as particularly high among users of illegal drugs  Sildenafil is sometimes used to counteract the effects of other substances  often illicit  Some users mix it with methylenedioxymethamphetamine  MDMA  ecstasy   other stimulants  or opiates in an attempt to compensate for the common side effect of erectile dysfunction  a combination known as  sextasy    rockin  and rollin    or  trail mix   Mixing with amyl nitrite is particularly dangerous and potentially fatal   4 2  Jet lag research  The 2007 Ig Nobel Prize in Aviation went to Patricia V  Agostino  Santiago A  Plano  and Diego A  Golombek of Universidad Nacional de Quilmes  Argentina  for their discovery that Viagra helps treat jet lag recovery in hamsters  Their research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences   4 3  Use in sports  Professional athletes have been documented using sildenafil  believing the opening of their blood vessels will enrich their muscles  In turn  they believe it will enhance their performances   4 4  Cut flowers  Israeli and Australian researchers discovered that 1 mg of the drug dissolved in a vase of water can extend the shelf life of cut flowers  making them stand up straight for up to a week beyond their natural lifespan  The drug also slows down plant ripening  tests were done strawberries  legumes  roses  carnations  broccoli  and other perishables  Viagra increases the vase life of the flowers by slowing the breakdown of cGMP by cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5  Viagra acts on the cGMP in a fashion similar to nitric oxide  which also slows down the ripening process   but was found to be easier to use with cut flowers   4 5  Analogs  Acetildenafil is a structural analog of sildenafil  one of the PDE5 inhibitors found in a number of  herbal  aphrodisiac products sold over the counter  This class of analogs has not undergone any of the rigorous testing that drugs like sildenafil have passed  thus has an unknown side effect profile  Some attempts have been made to ban these drugs  but progress has been slow so far  as  even in those jurisdictions that have laws targeting designer drugs  the laws are drafted to ban analogues of illegal drugs of abuse  rather than analogues of prescription medicines  However  at least one court case has resulted in a product being taken off the market   The US FDA has banned numerous products claiming to be Eurycoma longifolia that  in fact  contain only analogs of sildenafil  Peddlers of such fake herbals typically respond by just changing the names of their products   5  Detection in biological fluids  Sildenafil and or N desmethylsildenafil  its major active metabolite  may be quantified in plasma  serum  or whole blood to assess pharmacokinetic status in those receiving the drug therapeutically  to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims  or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose   6  Mechanism of action  The mechanism of action of sildenafil involves the protection of cyclic guanosine monophosphate  cGMP  from degradation by cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5  PDE5  in the corpus cavernosum  Nitric oxide  NO  in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to guanylate cyclase receptors  which results in increased levels of cGMP  leading to smooth muscle relaxation  vasodilation  of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries  This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis  causing an erection  Robert F  Furchgott  Ferid Murad  and Louis Ignarro won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle vasodilation   Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5  PDE5   which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum  The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum  resulting in more cGMP and better erections  Without sexual stimulation  and therefore lack of activation of the NO cGMP system  sildenafil should not cause an erection  Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include tadalafil  Cialis  and vardenafil  Levitra    Sildenafil is broken down in the liver by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome p450 enzymes  mainly CYP450 3A4 major route   but also by CYP2C9  minor route  hepatic isoenzymes  The major product of metabolisation by these enzymes is N desmethylated sildenafil  which is metabolised further  This metabolite also has an affinity for the PDE receptors  about 40% of that of sildenafil  Thus  the metabolite is responsible for about 20% of sildenafil s action  Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces  about 80% of administered oral dose  and to a lesser extent in the urine  around 13% of the administered oral dose   If taken with a high fat meal  absorption is reduced  the time taken to reach the maximum plasma concentration increases by around one hour  and the maximum concentration itself is decreased by nearly one third   7  Chemical synthesis  The preparation steps for synthesis of sildenafil are   Methylation of 3 propylpyrazole 5 carboxylic acid ethyl ester with hot dimethyl sulfate  Hydrolysis with aqueous NaOH to free acid  Nitration with oleum fuming nitric acid  Carboxamide formation with refluxing thionyl chloride NH4OH  Reduction of nitro group to amino  Acylation with 2 ethoxybenzoyl chloride  Cyclization  Sulfonation to the chlorosulfonyl derivative  Condensation with 1 methylpiperazine   8  History  8 1  Origins  Sildenafil  compound UK 92 480  was synthesized by a group of pharmaceutical chemists working at Pfizer s Sandwich  Kent  research facility in England  It was initially studied for use in hypertension  high blood pressure  and angina pectoris  a symptom of ischaemic heart disease   The first clinical trials were conducted in Morriston Hospital in Swansea  Phase I clinical trials under the direction of Ian Osterloh suggested the drug had little effect on angina  but it could induce marked penile erections  Pfizer therefore decided to market it for erectile dysfunction  rather than for angina  The drug was patented in 1996  approved for use in erectile dysfunction by the FDA on March 27  1998  becoming the first oral treatment approved to treat erectile dysfunction in the United States  and offered for sale in the United States later that year  It soon became a great success  annual sales of Viagra peaked in 2008 at US$1 934 million   The British press portrayed Peter Dunn and Albert Wood as the inventors of the drug  but only Andrew Bell  David Brown  and Nicholas Terrett are listed on the original composition of matter patent   8 2  Marketing and sales  Even though sildenafil is available only by prescription from a doctor  it was advertised directly to consumers on U S  TV  famously being endorsed by former United States Senator Bob Dole and football star Pelé   Numerous sites on the Internet offer Viagra for sale after an  online consultation   often a simple web questionnaire  The Viagra name has become so well known  many fake aphrodisiacs now call themselves  herbal viagra  or are presented as blue tablets imitating the shape and colour of Pfizer s product  Viagra is also informally known as  vitamin V    the blue pill   or  blue diamond   as well as various other nicknames   In 2000  Viagra sales accounted for 92% of the global market for prescribed erectile dysfunction pills  By 2007  Viagra s global share had plunged to about 50% due to several factors  including the entry of Cialis and Levitra  along with several counterfeits and clones  and reports of vision loss in people taking PDE5 inhibitors   In February 2007  it was announced that Boots  the UK pharmacy chain  would try over the counter sales of Viagra in stores in Manchester  England  Men between the ages 30 and 65 would be eligible to buy four tablets after a consultation with a pharmacist   On May 6  2013  Pfizer  which manufacturers Viagra  told the Associated Press they will begin selling the drug directly to patients on its website   8 3  Patents  8 3 1  European Union  Pfizer s patent on sildenafil citrate expired in some member countries of the EU  Austria  Denmark  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  The Netherlands  Spain  Sweden  the United Kingdom and Switzerland on 21 June 2013  A UK patent held by Pfizer on the use of PDE5 inhibitors  see below  as treatment of impotence was invalidated in 2000 because of obviousness  this decision was upheld on appeal in 2002   8 3 2  United States  In 1992  Pfizer filed a patent covering the substance sildenafil and its use to treat cardiovascular diseases  This patent was published in 1993 and expired in 2012  In 1994  Pfizer filed a patent covering the use of sildenafil to treat erectile dysfunction  This patent was published in 2002 and will expire in 2019  Teva sued to have the latter patent invalidated  but Pfizer prevailed in an August 2011 federal district court case   The patent on Revatio  indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension rather than erectile dysfunction  expired in late 2012  Generic versions of this low dose form of sildenafil have been available in the U S  from a number of manufacturers  including Greenstone  Mylan  and Watson  since early 2013  No legal barrier exists to doctors prescribing this form of sildenafil  off label  for erectile dysfunction  although the dosage typically required for treating ED requires patients to take multiple pills   8 3 3  Canada  In Canada  Pfizer s patent 2 324 324 for Revatio  sildenafil used to treat pulmonary hypertension  was found invalid by the Federal Court in June 2010  on an application by Ratiopharm Inc   On November 8  2012  the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Pfizer s patent 2 163 446 on Viagra was invalid from the beginning because the company did not provide full disclosure in its application  The decision  Teva Canada Ltd  v  Pfizer Canada Inc   pointed to section 27 3  b  of The Patent Act which requires that disclosure must include sufficient information  to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it pertains  to produce it  It added further   As a matter of policy and sound statutory interpretation  patentees cannot be allowed to  game  the system in this way  This  in my view  is the key issue in this appeal    Teva Canada launched Novo Sildenafil  a generic version of Viagra  on the day the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision  To remain competitive  Pfizer then reduced the price of Viagra in Canada  However  on November 9  2012  Pfizer filed a motion for a re hearing of the appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada  on the grounds that the court accidentally exceeded its jurisdiction by voiding the patent  Finally  on April 22  2013  the Supreme Court of Canada invalidated Pfizer s patent altogether   8 3 4  India  Manufacture and sale of sildenafil citrate drugs known as  generic viagra  is common in India  where Pfizer s patent claim does not apply  Trade names include Kamagra  Ajanta Pharma   Silagra  Cipla   Edegra  Sun Pharmaceutical   Penegra  Zydus Cadila   and Zenegra  Alkem Laboratories    8 3 5  China  Manufacture and sale of sildenafil citrate drugs is common in China  where Pfizer s patent claim is not widely enforced   8 3 6  Other countries  Egypt approved Viagra for sale in 2002  but soon afterwards allowed local companies to produce generic versions of the drug  citing the interests of poor people who would not be able to afford Pfizer s price   Pfizer s patent on sildenafil citrate expired in Brazil in 2010   9
