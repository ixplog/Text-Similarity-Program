The early history of Monaco is primarily concerned with the protective and strategic value of the Rock of Monaco  the area s chief geological landmark  which served first as a shelter for ancient peoples and later as a fortress  Part of Liguria s history since the fall of the Roman Empire  from the 14th to the early 15th century the area was contested for primarily political reasons  Since that point  excepting a brief period of French occupation  it has remained steadily under the control of the House of Grimaldi   1  Early history and Ligurian settlement  The Rock of Monaco served as a shelter for the area s early inhabitants from the end of the Paleolithic period  approximately 300 000 BC  evidence of which has been found in a cave in St  Judist s Gardens  According to the accounts of historian Diodorus Siculus and geographer Strabo  the area s first permanent settlers were the mountain dwelling Ligures  who emigrated from their native city of Genoa  Italy  However  the ancient Ligurian language  which probably was Indo European  is not directly connected to the Italian dialect spoken by the modern inhabitants of Liguria  nor to the modern Monegasque language   2  Greek colonization and Herculean legend  During the 6th century B C  Phocaeans from Massalia  modern day Marseille  founded the colony of Monoikos  The name of the colony derives from the local veneration of the Roman god Hercules  who was said to have constructed the ancient path that passed through the region from Spain to Italy  The Roman emperor Julian also wrote of Hercules s construction of Monaco s port and a coastal road  The road was dotted with altars to Hercules  and a temple dedicated to him was established on the Rock of Monaco  The name Port Hercules was subsequently used for the ancient port  Monoeci meaning  Single One  or Monoikos meaning  Single House  could be a reference to Hercules or his temple  or the isolated community inhabiting the area around the rock   According to the  travels of Hercules  theme  also documented by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo  both Greeks and native Ligurian people asserted that Hercules passed through the area   3  Roman rule  After the Gallic Wars  Monoecus  which served as a stopping point for Julius Caesar on his way to campaign in Greece  fell under Roman control as part of the Maritime Alps province  Gallia Transalpina    The Roman poet Virgil called it  that castled cliff  Monoecus by the sea   Aeneid  VI 830   The commentator Servius s use of the passage  in R  Maltby  Lexicon of Ancient Latin Etymologies  Leeds  asserts  under the entry portus  that the epithet was derived   No temple to Hercules has been found at Monaco  see also Lucan 1 405    although the rocky ground and dense conurbation make future excavations unlikely   The port is mentioned in Pliny the Elder s Natural History  III v  and in Tacitus  Histories  III 42   when Valens was forced to put into the port  Fabius Valens e sinu Pisano segnitia maris aut adversante vento portum Herculis Monoeci depellitur    4  Middle Ages  Monaco remained under Roman control until the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476  The city was then under the domain of Odoacer until his fall at the hands of the Ostrogoths in the late 5th century  Monaco was recaptured by the Romans during the reign of Justinian in the mid 6th century and was held until its capture by the Lombards in the 7th century  Monaco then passed hands between the Lombards and Franks  Though these raids left the area almost entirely depopulated  the Saracens were expelled in 975  and by the 11th century the area was again populated by Ligurians   In 1191  Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI granted suzerainty over the area to the city of Genoa  the native home of the Ligurians  On June 10  1215  a detachment of Genoese Ghibellines led by Fulco del Cassello began the construction of a fortress atop the Rock of Monaco  This date is often cited as the beginning of Monaco s modern history   As the Ghibellines intended their fortress to be a strategic military stronghold and center of control for the area  they set about creating a settlement around the base of the Rock to support the garrison  in an attempt to lure residents from Genoa and the surrounding cities  they offered land grants and tax exemption to new settlers   5  Rise of the Grimaldis  The Grimaldis  descended from Otto Canella and taking their name from his son Grimaldo  were an ancient and prominent Guelphic Genoese family  Members of this family  in the course of the civil strife in Genoa between the Guelphs and Ghibellines  took refuge in Monaco  accompanied by various other Guelphic families  most notably the Fieschis   Francesco Grimaldi seized the Rock of Monaco in 1297  starting the Grimaldi dynasty  under the sovereignty of the Republic of Genoa  The Grimaldis acquired Menton in 1346 and Roquebrune in 1355  enlarging their possessions  In 1338 Monegasque ships under the command of Carlo Grimaldi participated  along with those of France and Genoa  in the English Channel naval campaign  Plunder from the sack of Southampton was brought back to Monaco  contributing to the principality s prosperity   Honoré II  Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633  and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of Péronne  1641   Since then the area has remained under the control of the Grimaldi family to the present day  except when under French control during the French revolution from 1793 to May 17  1814   6  Protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia  The principality was re established in 1814  only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815  Monaco remained in this position until 1860  when by the Treaty of Turin  Sardinia ceded to France the surrounding county of Nice  as well as Savoy    With the protectorate  that lasted nearly half a century  Italian was the official language of Monaco  The Monégasque dialect is closer to Italian than French  but influenced by both   During this time there was unrest in the towns of Menton and Roquebrune  which declared independence  hoping for annexation by Sardinia and participation in the Italian Risorgimento  The unrest continued until the ruling prince gave up his claim to the two towns  some 95% of the country   and they were ceded to France in return for four million francs  This transfer and Monaco s sovereignty was recognised by the Franco Monegasque Treaty of 1861   7  Sovereignty  Designated as a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna after Napoleon s defeat  Monaco s sovereignty was confirmed by the Franco Monegasque Treaty of 1861  France accepted the existence of the Principality of Monaco  but annexed 95% of its former territory  the areas of Menton and Roquebrune   Monaco s military defense since then has been the responsibility of France   The Prince of Monaco was an absolute ruler until the Monegasque Revolution of 1910 forced him to proclaim a constitution in 1911  The famous Casino of Monte Carlo opened in 1863  organized by the Societé des Bains de Mer   Sea bathing Society    which also ran the  Hotel de Paris   taxes paid by the S B M  have been plowed into Monaco s infrastructure  Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with a railway link to France  In July 1918  a treaty was signed providing for limited French protection over Monaco  The treaty  written into the Treaty of Versailles  established that Monegasque policy would be aligned with French political  military  and economic interests  One of the motivations for the treaty was the upcoming Monaco Succession Crisis of 1918   While Prince Louis II s sympathies were strongly pro French  he tried to keep Monaco neutral during World War II but supported the Vichy French government of his old army colleague  Marshall Philippe Pétain   Nonetheless  his tiny principality was tormented by domestic conflict partly as a result of Louis  indecisiveness  and also because the majority of the population was of Italian descent  many of them supported the fascist regime of Italy s Benito Mussolini   In November 1942  the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco  setting up a fascist puppet government  Soon after in September 1943  following Mussolini s fall in Italy  the German Army occupied Monaco and began the deportation of the Jewish population   Among them was René Blum  founder of the Opera  who died in a Nazi concentration camp  Under Prince Louis  secret orders  the Monaco police  often at great risk to themselves  warned in advance those people whom the Gestapo planned to arrest  The country was liberated as German troops retreated   The current ruler  Prince Albert II  succeeded his father Prince Rainier III in 2005  Prince Rainier  in turn  had acceded to the throne following the death of his grandfather  Prince Louis II  in 1949   The revised Constitution of Monaco  proclaimed in 1962  abolished capital punishment  provided for female suffrage  established a Supreme Court to guarantee fundamental liberties and made it difficult for a French national to transfer his or her residence there   In 1993  Monaco became an official member of the United Nations with full voting rights  In 2002  a new treaty between France and Monaco clarifies that if there are no heirs to carry on the dynasty  the Principality will remain an independent nation  rather than be annexed by France  Monaco s military defense  however  is still the responsibility of France   The principality s mild climate  attractive scenery  and gambling facilities have made Monaco world famous as a tourism and recreation centre   8  See also  History of Europe  History of France  History of Italy  List of Princes of Monaco  Politics of Monaco  9  Notes  10  References  11  Further reading
