Mere Christianity is a theological book by C  S  Lewis  adapted from a series of BBC radio talks made between 1942 and 1944  while Lewis was at Oxford during World War II  Considered a classic of Christian apologetics  the transcripts of the broadcasts originally appeared in print as three separate pamphlets  The Case for Christianity  1942   Christian Behaviour  1943   and Beyond Personality  1944   Lewis was invited to give the talks by Rev  James Welch  the BBC Director of Religious Broadcasting  who had read his 1940 book  The Problem of Pain   1  Thesis  Lewis  an Anglican  intended to describe the Christian common ground  In Mere Christianity  he aims at avoiding controversies to explain fundamental teachings of Christianity  for the sake of those basically educated as well as the intellectuals of his generation  for whom the jargon of formal Christian theology did not retain its original meaning   1 1  The Case for Christianity  Lewis spends most of his defense of the Christian faith on an argument from morality  a point which persuaded him from atheism to Christianity  He bases his case on a moral law  a  rule about right and wrong  commonly known to all human beings  citing the example of Nazism  both Christians and atheists believed that Hitler s actions were morally wrong  On a more mundane level  it is generally accepted that stealing is violating this moral law  Lewis argues that the moral law is like the law of nature in that it was not contrived by humans  However  it is unlike natural laws in that it can be broken or ignored  and it is known intuitively  rather than through observation  After introducing the moral law  Lewis argues that thirst reflects the fact that people naturally need water  and there is no other substance which satisfies that need  Lewis points out that earthly experience does not satisfy the human craving for  joy  and that only God could fit the bill  humans cannot know to yearn for something if it does not exist   After providing reasons for his conversion to theism  Lewis goes over rival conceptions of God to Christianity  Pantheism  he argues  is incoherent  and atheism too simple  Eventually he arrives at Jesus Christ  and invokes a well known argument now known as the  Lewis trilemma   Lewis  arguing that Jesus was claiming to be God  uses logic to advance three possibilities  either he really was God  was deliberately lying  or was not God but thought himself to be  which would make him delusional and likely insane   The book goes on to say that the latter two possibilities are not consistent with Jesus  character and it was most likely that he was being truthful   Lewis claims that to understand Christianity  one must understand the moral law  which is the underlying structure of the universe and is  hard as nails   Unless one grasps the dismay which comes from humanity s failure to keep the moral law  one cannot understand the coming of Christ and his work  The eternal God who is the law s source takes primacy over the created Satan whose rebellion undergirds all evil  The death and resurrection of Christ is introduced as the only way in which our inadequate human attempts to redeem humanity s sins could be made adequate in God s eyes   God  became a man  in Christ  Lewis says  so that mankind could be  amalgamated with God s nature  and make full atonement possible  Lewis offers several analogies to explain this abstract concept  that of Jesus  paying the penalty  for a crime   paying a debt   or helping humanity out of a hole  His main point  however  is that redemption is so incomprehensible that it cannot be fully appreciated  and he attempts to explain that the method by which God atones for the sins of humanity is not nearly as important as the fact that he does so   1 2  Christian Behaviour  The next third of the book explores the ethics resulting from Christian belief  He cites the four cardinal virtues  prudence  justice  temperance  and fortitude  After touching on these  he goes into the three theological virtues  hope  faith  and charity  Lewis also explains morality as being composed of three layers  relationships between man and man  the motivations and attitudes of the man himself  and contrasting worldviews   Lewis also covers such topics as social relations and forgiveness  sexual ethics and the tenets of Christian marriage  and the relationship between morality and psychoanalysis  He also writes about the great sin  pride  which he argues to be the root cause of all evil and rebellion   His most important point is that Christianity mandates that one  love your neighbor as yourself   He points out that all persons unconditionally love themselves  Even if one does not like oneself  one would still love oneself  Christians  he writes  must also apply this attitude to others  even if they do not like them  Lewis calls this one of the great secrets  when one acts as if he loves others  he will presently come to love them   2  Cultural impact  In 2006  Mere Christianity was placed third in Christianity Today s list of the most influential books amongst evangelicals since 1945  The title has influenced Touchstone Magazine  A Journal of Mere Christianity and William Dembski s book Mere Creation  Charles Colson s conversion to Christianity resulted from his reading this book  as did the conversions of Francis Collins  Jonathan Aitken  Josh Caterer and the philosopher C  E  M  Joad   A passage in the book also influenced the name of contemporary Christian Texan Grammy nominated pop rock group Sixpence None the Richer  The phrase   the hammering process  was used by Christian metal band Living Sacrifice for the name of their album The Hammering Process  Metalcore band  Norma Jean  derived the title of their song  No Passenger  No Parasite  from the section in the book in which Lewis describes a fully Christian society as having  No passengers or parasites    3  References  4  External
