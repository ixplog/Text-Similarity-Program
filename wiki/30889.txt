Bowes Benson  1833 1890   second sister of Edward White Benson  archbishop of Canterbury  q  v  Suppl    by whom he had issue Mary Eleanor  1874 1883    3  Views  Hare was said to have been  conspicuous for great industry – to have wide interests in life and clearness of intellectual vision   He was a member of the London based Political Economy Club and the British Dictionary of National Biography says of him   His original electoral system ideas included making England one huge electorate  later he changed this to seven or eight hundred electorates  and that each voter would sign and check his vote  By 1873  however  he had adapted his ideas to take account of the secret vote  Under Hare s method  simply dividing the vote by the number of seats constituted the quota and then the surplus was expected to be distributed  at random    Hare s famous original work Machinery of Representation appeared in 1857  in two editions  and many editions of his equally famous Treatise on the Election of Representatives  Parliamentary and Municipal appeared between 1859 and 1873  In the preface to the fourth edition he stated his belief that proportional representation would      end the evils of corruption  violent discontent and restricted power of selection or voter choice   A great deal of writing on this theory developed and several societies were formed worldwide for its adoption  although Hare pointed out that his scheme was not meant to bear the title  representation for minorities   Moreover  he noted in the preface to his third edition a point that was to become a feature of Tasmanian politics   Finally  with the help of contemporaries such as John Stuart Mill and Catherine Helen Spence  Hare popularised the idea of proportional representation worldwide  The permanent recognition of his name in the Tasmanian system is perhaps appropriate despite little being left of his original proposals  His death in May 1891 occurred several years before the first use of proportional representation in Tasmania in 1897   The London headquarters of the Electoral Reform Society are named in his honour   4  Systems  Hare lends his name to the following   a system of proportional representation  also known as Single Transferable Vote  STV   a particular quota being used by STV  the Hare quota  a seat allocation method  also known as the largest remainder method The Single Transferable Vote method has been widely used for multiple winner elections  While continuing to be the main method of elections in the Republic of Ireland and for some elections in Australia  it has been widely used in numerous corporations and organizations  and has been employed in local elections in a few jurisdictions of the United States  2007 saw the reintroduction of STV in public elections on the British mainland in elections to Scottish local authorities  STV had been used for elections to Parliament for some University Seats from 1918 to 1945 and in 1918 for Scottish boards   Mill described Hare s system as  the greatest improvement of which the system of representative government is susceptible  an improvement which…exactly meets and cures the grand  and what before seemed inherent  defect of the representative system    Hare was not a mathematician so never subjected his STV system to a rigorous mathematical analysis   5  Law reports  Hare also obtained minor fame in an entirely different field  law reporting   At a time when there were no official reports of judicial decisions  Hare published reports of key decisions of the courts to enable them to be used as precedents  Two key judicial decisions  which are still frequently cited today  are reported only in Hare s Reports in Chancery   Henderson v Henderson  1843  3 Hare 100  from which the rule known as  the rule in Henderson v Henderson  is derived   Foss v Harbottle  1843  2 Hare 461  from which the rule known as  the rule in Foss v Harbottle  is derived  and which is still the cornerstone of minority shareholder rights in company law in common law legal systems over 160 years later  The Hare law reports were published from 1841 to 1853   6  Works  The machinery of representation  1857   A treatise on election of representatives  parliamentary and municipal  1859   The election of representatives parliamentary and municipal  a treatise  1865   7  References
