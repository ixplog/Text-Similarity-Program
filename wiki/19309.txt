Aérea de Moçambique  or FAM was part of the national army initially  and from 1985 to 1990 was known as the People s Liberation Air Force  Força Aérea Popular de Libertação   Due to Mozambique s history  the air force has a history of using former Portuguese aircraft  ever since its setting up after independence in 1975  supported by Cuba and the USSR  As such there was an inflow of Soviet built aircraft to support the government in the civil war up to 1992  Following the ceasefire in that year the change in government policies towards Western style economics meant that Cuban support for the Air Force dwindled and most of the aircraft have fallen into disrepair at the three main bases of Beira  Nacala and Nampula  The FAM is now effectively a token force  and the defence budget has been cut down to 1 5 of Mozambique s Gross National Product  The aircraft inventory is thus  The number of personnel in the Air Force are estimated at 4000   In 2011  the Portuguese Air Force
