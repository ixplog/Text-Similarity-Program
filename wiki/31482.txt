In geometry  the tangent line  or simply tangent  to a plane curve at a given point is the straight line that  just touches  the curve at that point  Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve  More precisely  a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve at a point on the curve if the line passes through the point on the curve and has slope where f is the derivative of f  A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in n dimensional Euclidean space   As it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet  called the point of tangency  the tangent line is  going in the same direction  as the curve  and is thus the best straight line approximation to the curve at that point   Similarly  the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that  just touches  the surface at that point  The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized  see Tangent space   The word tangent comes from the Latin   wikt en tangere#Latin tangere    to touch   1  History  The first definition of a tangent was  a right line which touches a curve  but which when produced  does not cut it   This old definition prevents inflection points from having any tangent  It has been dismissed and the modern definitions are equivalent to those of Leibniz  The tangent problem has given rise to differential calculus  The main ideas behind differential calculus are due to Pierre Fermat and were developed by John Wallis  Isaac Barrow  Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz   Pierre de Fermat developed a general technique for determining the tangents of a curve using his method of adequality in the 1630s   Leibniz defined the tangent line as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve   2  Tangent line to a curve  The intuitive notion that a tangent line  touches  a curve can be made more explicit by considering the sequence of straight lines  secant lines  passing through two points  A and B  those that lie on the function curve  The tangent at A is the limit when point B approximates or tends to A  The existence and uniqueness of the tangent line depends on a certain type of mathematical smoothness  known as  differentiability   For example  if two circular arcs meet at a sharp point  a vertex  then there is no uniquely defined tangent at the vertex because the limit of the progression of secant lines depends on the direction in which  point B  approaches the vertex   At most points  the tangent touches the curve without crossing it  though it may  when continued  cross the curve at other places away from the point of tangent   A point where the tangent  at this point  crosses the curve is called an inflection point  Circles  parabolas  hyperbolas and ellipses do not have any inflection point  but more complicated curves do have  like the graph of a cubic function  which has exactly one inflection point   Conversely  it may happen that the curve lies entirely on one side of a straight line passing through a point on it  and yet this straight line is not a tangent line  This is the case  for example  for a line passing through the vertex of a triangle and not intersecting the triangle—where the tangent line does not exist for the reasons explained above  In convex geometry  such lines are called supporting lines   2 1  Analytical approach  The geometrical idea of the tangent line as the limit of secant lines serves as the motivation for analytical methods that are used to find tangent lines explicitly  The question of finding the tangent line to a graph  or the tangent line problem  was one of the central questions leading to the development of calculus in the 17th century  In the second book of his Geometry  René Descartes   s fr Page Descartes La Géométrie djvu 52 said   of the problem of constructing the tangent to a curve   And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most general problem in geometry that I know  but even that I have ever desired to know    2 1 1  Intuitive description  Suppose that a curve is given as the graph of a function  y   f x   To find the tangent line at the point p    a  f a    consider another nearby point q    a + h  f a + h   on the curve  The slope of the secant line passing through p and q is equal to the difference quotient  As the point q approaches p  which corresponds to making h smaller and smaller  the difference quotient should approach a certain limiting value k  which is the slope of the tangent line at the point p  If k is known  the equation of the tangent line can be found in the point slope form   2 1 2  More rigorous description  To make the preceding reasoning rigorous  one has to explain what is meant by the difference quotient approaching a certain limiting value k  The precise mathematical formulation was given by Cauchy in the 19th century and is based on the notion of limit  Suppose that the graph does not have a break or a sharp edge at p and it is neither plumb nor too wiggly near p  Then there is a unique value of k such that  as h approaches 0  the difference quotient gets closer and closer to k  and the distance between them becomes negligible compared with the size of h  if h is small enough  This leads to the definition of the slope of the tangent line to the graph as the limit of the difference quotients for the function f  This limit is the derivative of the function f at x   a  denoted f ′ a   Using derivatives  the equation of the tangent line can be stated as follows   Calculus provides rules for computing the derivatives of functions that are given by formulas  such as the power function  trigonometric functions  exponential function  logarithm  and their various combinations  Thus  equations of the tangents to graphs of all these functions  as well as many others  can be found by the methods of calculus   2 1 3  How the method can fail  Calculus also demonstrates that there are functions and points on their graphs for which the limit determining the slope of the tangent line does not exist  For these points the function f is non differentiable  There are two possible reasons for the method of finding the tangents based on the limits and derivatives to fail  either the geometric tangent exists  but it is a vertical line  which cannot be given in the point slope form since it does not have a slope  or the graph exhibits one of three behaviors that precludes a geometric tangent   The graph y   x1 3 illustrates the first possibility  here the difference quotient at a   0 is equal to h1 3 h   h−2 3  which becomes very large as h approaches 0  This curve has a tangent line at the origin that is vertical   The graph y   x2 3 illustrates another possibility  this graph has a cusp at the origin  This means that  when h approaches 0  the difference quotient at a   0 approaches plus or minus infinity depending on the sign of x  Thus both branches of the curve are near to the half vertical line for which y 0  but none is near to the negative part of this line  Basically  there is no tangent at the origin in this case  but in some context one may consider this line as a tangent  and even  in algebraic geometry  as a double tangent   The graph y    x  of the absolute value function consists of two straight lines with different slopes joined at the origin  As a point q approaches the origin from the right  the secant line always has slope 1  As a point q approaches the origin from the left  the secant line always has slope −1  Therefore  there is no unique tangent to the graph at the origin  Having two different  but finite  slopes is called a corner   Finally  since differentiability implies continuity  the contrapositive states discontinuity implies non differentiability  Any such jump or point discontinuity will have no tangent line  This includes cases where one slope approaches positive infinity while the other approaches negative infinity  leading to an infinite jump discontinuity  2 2  Equations  When the curve is given by y   f x  then the slope of the tangent is so by the point–slope formula the equation of the tangent line at  X  Y  is  where  x  y  are the coordinates of any point on the tangent line  and where the derivative is evaluated at    When the curve is given by y   f x   the tangent line s equation can also be found by using polynomial division to divide by   if the remainder is denoted by   then the equation of the tangent line is given by  When the equation of the curve is given in the form f x  y    0 then the value of the slope can be found by implicit differentiation  giving  The equation of the tangent line at a point  X Y  such that f X Y    0 is then  This equation remains true if but  in this case the slope of the tangent is infinite   If the tangent line is not defined and the point  X Y  is said singular   For algebraic curves  computations may be simplified somewhat by converting to homogeneous coordinates  Specifically  let the homogeneous equation of the curve be g x  y  z    0 where g is a homogeneous function of degree n  Then  if  X  Y  Z  lies on the curve  Euler s theorem implies  It follows that the homogeneous equation of the tangent line is  The equation of the tangent line in Cartesian coordinates can be found by setting z 1 in this equation   To apply this to algebraic curves  write f x  y  as  where each ur is the sum of all terms of degree r  The homogeneous equation of the curve is then  Applying the equation above and setting z 1 produces  as the equation of the tangent line  The equation in this form is often simpler to use in practice since no further simplification is needed after it is applied   If the curve is given parametrically by  then the slope of the tangent is  giving the equation for the tangent line at as  If   the tangent line is not defined  However  it may occur that the tangent line exists and may be computed from an implicit equation of the curve   2 3  Normal line to a curve  The line perpendicular to the tangent line to a curve at the point of tangency is called the normal line to the curve at that point  The slopes of perpendicular lines have product −1  so if the equation of the curve is y   f x  then slope of the normal line is  and it follows that the equation of the normal line at  X  Y  is  Similarly  if the equation of the curve has the form f x  y    0 then the equation of the normal line is given by  If the curve is given parametrically by  then the equation of the normal line is  2 4  Angle between curves  The angle between two curves at a point where they intersect is defined as the angle between their tangent lines at that point  More specifically  two curves are said to be tangent at a point if they have the same tangent at a point  and orthogonal if their tangent lines are orthogonal   2 5  Multiple tangents at the origin  The formulas above fail when the point is a singular point  In this case there may be two or more branches of the curve which pass through the point  each branch having its own tangent line  When the point is the origin  the equations of these lines can be found for algebraic curves by factoring the equation formed by eliminating all but the lowest degree terms from the original equation  Since any point can be made the origin by a change of variables  this gives a method for finding the tangent lines at any singular point   For example  the equation of the limaçon trisectrix shown to the right is  Expanding this and eliminating all but terms of degree 2 gives  which  when factored  becomes  So these are the equations of the two tangent lines through the origin   3  Tangent circles  Two circles of non equal radius  both in the same plane  are said to be tangent to each other if they meet at only one point  Equivalently  two circles  with radii of ri and centers at  xi  yi   for i   1  2 are said to be tangent to each other if  Two circles are externally tangent if the distance between their centres is equal to the sum of their radii   Two circles are internally tangent if the distance between their centres is equal to the difference between their radii   4  Surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds  The tangent plane to a surface at a given point p is defined in an analogous way to the tangent line in the case of curves  It is the best approximation of the surface by a plane at p  and can be obtained as the limiting position of the planes passing through 3 distinct points on the surface close to p as these points converge to p  More generally  there is a k dimensional tangent space at each point of a k dimensional manifold in the n dimensional Euclidean space   5  See also  Newton s method  Normal  geometry   Osculating circle  Osculating curve  Perpendicular  Subtangent  Supporting line  Tangent cone  Tangential angle
