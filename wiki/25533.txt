Rheged    is described in poetic sources as one of the kingdoms of the Hen Ogledd   Old North    the Brittonic speaking region of what is now Northern England and southern Scotland  in the Early Middle Ages  Its borders are not described in the poems  but some modern scholars have suggested that it included what is now Cumbria in North West England and possibly extended into Lancashire and Scotland  In the historical sources Rheged is intimately associated with the king Urien Rheged and his family  Its inhabitants spoke Cumbric  a Brittonic dialect closely related to Old Welsh   1  Location  The name Rheged appears regularly as an epithet of a certain Urien in a number of early Welsh poems and royal genealogies  His victories over the Anglian chieftains of Bernicia in the second half of the 6th century are recorded by Nennius and celebrated by the bard Taliesin  who calls him  Ruler of Rheged   He is thus placed squarely in the North of Britain and perhaps specifically in Westmorland when referred to as  Ruler of Llwyfenydd   identified with the Lyvennet Valley   Later legend associates Urien with the city of Carlisle  the Roman Luguvalium   only twenty five miles away  Higham suggests that Rheged was  broadly conterminous with the earlier Civitas Carvetiorum  the Roman administrative unit based on Carlisle   Although it is possible that Rheged was merely a stronghold  it was not uncommon for sub Roman monarchs to use their kingdom s name as an epithet  It is generally accepted  therefore  that Rheged was a kingdom covering a large part of modern Cumbria   Place name evidence from Dunragit  possibly  Fort of Rheged   suggests that  at least in one period of its history  Rheged extended into Dumfries and Galloway  More problematic interpretations suggest that it could also have reached as far south as Rochdale in Greater Manchester  recorded in the Domesday Book as Recedham  The River Roch on which Rochdale stands was recorded in the 13th century as Rached or Rachet  These place names may  apparently  incorporate the element  Rheged  precisely because they lay on or near its borders  Certainly Urien s kingdom stretched eastward at one time  as he was also  Ruler of Catraeth   Catterick in North Yorkshire    2  Kings of Rheged  The traditional royal genealogy of Urien and his successors traces their ancestry back to Coel Hen  alias King Cole   who is considered by many to be a mythical figure  if he has some historicity  he may have ruled a considerable part of the North in the early 5th century  All of those listed below may have ruled in Rheged  but only three of their number can be verified from external sources   Meirchion Gul  father of Cynfarch  Cynfarch Oer  Cynfarch the Dismal   also known as Cynfarch fab Meirchion and Cynfarch Gul  father of Urien  Urien Rheged   c  550 – 590   about whom survive eight songs of Taliesin  Owain  also celebrated for having fought the Bernicians  son of Urien  3  Southern Rheged  A second royal genealogy exists for a line  perhaps of kings  descended from Cynfarch Oer s brother  Elidir Lydanwyn  According to Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd Elidir s son  Llywarch Hen  was a ruler in North Britain in the 6th century  He was driven from his territory by princely in fighting after Urien s death and was perhaps in old age associated with Powys  However  it is possible  because of internal inconsistencies  that the poetry connected to Powys was associated with Llywarch s name at a later  probably 9th century  date  Llywarch is referred to in some poems as king of South Rheged  and in others as king of Argoed  suggesting that the two regions were the same  Searching for Llywarch s kingdom has led some historians to propose that Rheged may have been divided between sons  resulting in northern and southern successor states  The connections of the family of Llywarch and Urien with Powys has suggested to some  on grounds of proximity  that the area of modern Lancashire may have been their original home   4  End of Rheged  After Bernicia united with Deira to become the kingdom of Northumbria  Rheged was annexed by Northumbria  some time before AD 730  There was a royal marriage between Prince  later King  Oswiu of Northumbria and the Rhegedian princess Riemmelth  granddaughter of Rum  Rhun   probably in 638  so it is probable that it was a peaceful takeover  both kingdoms being inherited by the same man   After Rheged was incorporated into Northumbria  the old Cumbric language was gradually replaced by Old English  Cumbric surviving only in remote upland communities  In the 10th century  after the power of Northumbria was destroyed by Viking incursions and settlement  large areas west of the Pennines fell without warfare under the control of the British Kingdom of Strathclyde  with Leeds recorded as being on the border between the Britons and the Norse Kingdom of York  This may have represented the political assertion of lingering British culture in the region  The area of Cumbria remained under the control of Strathclyde until the early 11th century when Strathclyde itself was absorbed into the Scottish kingdom  The name of the people  whose modern Welsh form is Cymry has  however  survived in the name of Cumberland and now Cumbria  it probably derives from an old Celtic word *Kombroges meaning  fellow countrymen    5  Rheged Centre  The name Rheged has been adopted by the Rheged Centre close to Penrith in Cumbria  The centre has a number of retail outlets and cafés with a Cumbrian theme  as well as the largest turf roof in Europe and a giant cinema screen   A special film was commissioned for the opening of the centre in 2000 but this film is no longer being shown   Rheged  The Lost Kingdom     www imdb com title
