The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System  UMTS  is a third generation mobile cellular system for networks based on the GSM standard  Developed and maintained by the 3GPP  3rd Generation Partnership Project   UMTS is a component of the International Telecommunications Union IMT 2000 standard set and compares with the CDMA2000 standard set for networks based on the competing cdmaOne technology  UMTS uses wideband code division multiple access  W CDMA  radio access technology to offer greater spectral efficiency and bandwidth to mobile network operators   UMTS specifies a complete network system  which includes the radio access network  UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network  or UTRAN   the core network  Mobile Application Part  or MAP  and the authentication of users via SIM  subscriber identity module  cards   The technology described in UMTS is sometimes also referred to as Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access  FOMA  or 3GSM   Unlike EDGE  IMT Single Carrier  based on GSM  and CDMA2000  IMT Multi Carrier   UMTS requires new base stations and new frequency allocations   1  Features  UMTS supports maximum theoretical data transfer rates of 42 Mbit s when HSPA+ is implemented in the network  Users in deployed networks can expect a transfer rate of up to 384 kbit s for Release  99  R99  handsets  the original UMTS release   and 7 2 Mbit s for HSDPA handsets in the downlink connection  These speeds are significantly faster than the 9 6 kbit s of a single GSM error corrected circuit switched data channel  multiple 9 6 kbit s channels in HSCSD and 14 4 kbit s for CDMAOne channels   Since 2006  UMTS networks in many countries have been or are in the process of being upgraded with High Speed Downlink Packet Access  HSDPA   sometimes known as 3 5G  Currently  HSDPA enables downlink transfer speeds of up to 21 Mbit s  Work is also progressing on improving the uplink transfer speed with the High Speed Uplink Packet Access  HSUPA   Longer term  the 3GPP Long Term Evolution  LTE  project plans to move UMTS to 4G speeds of 100 Mbit s down and 50 Mbit s up  using a next generation air interface technology based upon orthogonal frequency division multiplexing   The first national consumer UMTS networks launched in 2002 with a heavy emphasis on telco provided mobile applications such as mobile TV and video calling  The high data speeds of UMTS are now most often utilised for Internet access  experience in Japan and elsewhere has shown that user demand for video calls is not high  and telco provided audio video content has declined in popularity in favour of high speed access to the World Wide Web—either directly on a handset or connected to a computer via Wi Fi  Bluetooth or USB   2  Technology  UMTS combines three different air interfaces  GSM s Mobile Application Part  MAP  core  and the GSM family of speech codecs   2 1  Air interfaces  UMTS provides several different terrestrial air interfaces  called UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access  UTRA   All air interface options are part of ITU s IMT 2000  In the currently most popular variant for cellular mobile telephones  W CDMA  IMT Direct Spread  is used   Please note that the terms W CDMA  TD CDMA and TD SCDMA are misleading  While they suggest covering just a channel access method  namely a variant of CDMA   they are actually the common names for the whole air interface standards   2 1 1  W CDMA  UTRA FDD   W CDMA uses the DS CDMA channel access method with a pair of 5 MHz wide channels  In contrast  the competing CDMA2000 system uses one or more available 1 25 MHz channels for each direction of communication  W CDMA systems are widely criticized for their large spectrum usage  which has delayed deployment in countries that acted relatively slowly in allocating new frequencies specifically for 3G services  such as the United States    The specific frequency bands originally defined by the UMTS standard are 1885–2025 MHz for the mobile to base  uplink  and 2110–2200 MHz for the base to mobile  downlink   In the US  1710–1755 MHz and 2110–2155 MHz are used instead  as the 1900 MHz band was already used  While UMTS2100 is the most widely deployed UMTS band  some countries  UMTS operators use the 850 MHz and or 1900 MHz bands  independently  meaning uplink and downlink are within the same band   notably in the US by AT&T Mobility  New Zealand by Telecom New Zealand on the XT Mobile Network and in Australia by Telstra on the Next G network  Some carriers such as T Mobile use band numbers to identify the UMTS frequencies  For example  Band I  2100 MHz   Band IV  1700 2100 MHz   and Band V  850 MHz    W CDMA is a part of IMT 2000 as IMT Direct Spread   2 1 2  TD CDMA  UTRA TDD 3 84 Mcps High Chip Rate  HCR    UMTS TDD s air interfaces that use the TD CDMA channel access technique are standardized as UTRA TDD HCR  which uses increments of 5 MHz of spectrum  each slice divided into 10ms frames containing fifteen time slots  1500 per second   The time slots  TS  are allocated in fixed percentage for downlink and uplink  TD CDMA is used to multiplex streams from or to multiple transceivers  Unlike W CDMA  it does not need separate frequency bands for up  and downstream  allowing deployment in tight frequency bands   TD CDMA is a part of IMT 2000 as IMT CDMA TDD   2 1 3  TD SCDMA  UTRA TDD 1 28 Mcps Low Chip Rate  LCR    TD SCDMA uses the TDMA channel access method combined with an adaptive synchronous CDMA component on 1 6 MHz slices of spectrum  allowing deployment in even tighter frequency bands than TD CDMA  However  the main incentive for development of this Chinese developed standard was avoiding or reducing the license fees that have to be paid to non Chinese patent owners  Unlike the other air interfaces  TD SCDMA was not part of UMTS from the beginning but has been added in Release 4 of the specification   Like TD CDMA  TD SCDMA is known as IMT CDMA TDD within IMT 2000   2 2  Radio access network  UMTS also specifies the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network  UTRAN   which is composed of multiple base stations  possibly using different terrestrial air interface standards and frequency bands   UMTS and GSM EDGE can share a Core Network  CN   making UTRAN an alternative radio access network to GERAN  GSM EDGE RAN   and allowing  mostly  transparent switching between the RANs according to available coverage and service needs  Because of that  UMTS s and GSM EDGE s radio access networks are sometimes collectively referred to as UTRAN GERAN   UMTS networks are often combined with GSM EDGE  the latter of which is also a part of IMT 2000   The UE  User Equipment  interface of the RAN  Radio Access Network  primarily consists of RRC  Radio Resource Control   RLC  Radio Link Control  and MAC  Media Access Control  protocols  RRC protocol handles connection establishment  measurements  radio bearer services  security and handover decisions  RLC protocol primarily divides into three Modes—Transparent Mode  TM   Unacknowledge Mode  UM   Acknowledge Mode  AM   The functionality of AM entity resembles TCP operation whereas UM operation resembles UDP operation  In TM mode  data will be sent to lower layers without adding any header to SDU of higher layers  MAC handles the scheduling of data on air interface depending on higher layer  RRC  configured parameters   The set of properties related to data transmission is called Radio Bearer  RB   This set of properties decides the maximum allowed data in a TTI  Transmission Time Interval   RB includes RLC information and RB mapping  RB mapping decides the mapping between RB   logical channel   transport channel  Signaling messages are sent on Signaling Radio Bearers  SRBs  and data packets  either CS or PS  are sent on data RBs  RRC and NAS messages go on SRBs   Security includes two procedures  integrity and ciphering  Integrity validates the resource of messages and also makes sure that no one  third unknown party  on the radio interface has modified the messages  Ciphering ensures that no one listens to your data on the air interface  Both integrity and ciphering are applied for SRBs whereas only ciphering is applied for data RBs   2 3  Core network  With Mobile Application Part  UMTS uses the same core network standard as GSM EDGE  This allows a simple migration for existing GSM operators  However  the migration path to UMTS is still costly  while much of the core infrastructure is shared with GSM  the cost of obtaining new spectrum licenses and overlaying UMTS at existing towers is high   The CN can be connected to various backbone networks  such as the Internet or an Integrated Services Digital Network  ISDN  telephone network  UMTS  and GERAN  include the three lowest layers of OSI model  The network layer  OSI 3  includes the Radio Resource Management protocol  RRM  that manages the bearer channels between the mobile terminals and the fixed network  including the handovers   3  Spectrum allocation  Over 130 licenses have already been awarded to operators worldwide  as of December 2004   specifying W CDMA radio access technology that builds on GSM  In Europe  the license process occurred at the tail end of the technology bubble  and the auction mechanisms for allocation set up in some countries resulted in some extremely high prices being paid for the original 2100 MHz licenses  notably in the UK and Germany  In Germany  bidders paid a total €50 8 billion for six licenses  two of which were subsequently abandoned and written off by their purchasers  Mobilcom and the Sonera Telefonica consortium   It has been suggested that these huge license fees have the character of a very large tax paid on future income expected many years down the road  In any event  the high prices paid put some European telecom operators close to bankruptcy  most notably KPN   Over the last few years some operators have written off some or all of the license costs  Between 2007 and 2009  all three Finnish carriers began to use 900 MHz UMTS in a shared arrangement with its surrounding 2G GSM base stations for rural area coverage  a trend that is expected to expand over Europe in the next 1–3 years   The 2100 MHz band  downlink around 2100 MHz and uplink around 1900 MHz  allocated for UMTS in Europe and most of Asia is already used in North America  The 1900 MHz range is used for 2G  PCS  services  and 2100 MHz range is used for satellite communications  Regulators have  however  freed up some of the 2100 MHz range for 3G services  together with a different range around 1700 MHz for the uplink   AT&T Wireless launched UMTS services in the United States by the end of 2004 strictly using the existing 1900 MHz spectrum allocated for 2G PCS services  Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless in 2004 and has since then launched UMTS in select US cities  Cingular renamed itself AT&T Mobility and is rolling out some cities with a UMTS network at 850 MHz to enhance its existing UMTS network at 1900 MHz and now offers subscribers a number of dual band UMTS 850 1900 phones   T Mobile s rollout of UMTS in the US focused on the 1700 MHz band   In Canada  UMTS coverage is being provided on the 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands on the Rogers and Bell Telus networks  Bell and Telus share the network  Recently  new providers Wind Mobile  Mobilicity and Videotron have begun operations in the 1700 MHz band   In 2008  Australian telco Telstra replaced its existing CDMA network with a national UMTS based 3G network  branded as NextG  operating in the 850 MHz band  Telstra currently provides UMTS service on this network  and also on the 2100 MHz UMTS network  through a co ownership of the owning and administrating company 3GIS  This company is also co owned by Hutchison 3G Australia  and this is the primary network used by their customers  Optus is currently rolling out a 3G network operating on the 2100 MHz band in cities and most large towns  and the 900 MHz band in regional areas  Vodafone is also building a 3G network using the 900 MHz band   In India  BSNL has started its 3G services since October 2009  beginning with the larger cities and then expanding over to smaller cities  The 850 MHz and 900 MHz bands provide greater coverage compared to equivalent 1700 1900 2100 MHz networks  and are best suited to regional areas where greater distances separate base station and subscriber   Carriers in South America are now also rolling out 850 MHz networks   4  Interoperability and global roaming  UMTS phones  and data cards  are highly portable—they have been designed to roam easily onto other UMTS networks  if the providers have roaming agreements in place   In addition  almost all UMTS phones are UMTS GSM dual mode devices  so if a UMTS phone travels outside of UMTS coverage during a call the call may be transparently handed off to available GSM coverage  Roaming charges are usually significantly higher than regular usage charges   Most UMTS licensees consider ubiquitous  transparent global roaming an important issue  To enable a high degree of interoperability  UMTS phones usually support several different frequencies in addition to their GSM fallback  Different countries support different UMTS frequency bands – Europe initially used 2100 MHz while the most carriers in the USA use 850   MHz and 1900   MHz  T Mobile has launched a network in the US operating at 1700 MHz  uplink   2100 MHz  downlink   and these bands are also being adopted elsewhere in the Americas  A UMTS phone and network must support a common frequency to work together  Because of the frequencies used  early models of UMTS phones designated for the United States will likely not be operable elsewhere and vice versa  There are now 11 different frequency combinations used around the world—including frequencies formerly used solely for 2G services   UMTS phones can use a Universal Subscriber Identity Module  USIM  based on GSM s SIM  and also work  including UMTS services  with GSM SIM cards  This is a global standard of identification  and enables a network to identify and authenticate the  U SIM in the phone  Roaming agreements between networks allow for calls to a customer to be redirected to them while roaming and determine the services  and prices  available to the user  In addition to user subscriber information and authentication information  the  U SIM provides storage space for phone book contact  Handsets can store their data on their own memory or on the  U SIM card  which is usually more limited in its phone book contact information   A  U SIM can be moved to another UMTS or GSM phone  and the phone will take on the user details of the  U SIM  meaning it is the  U SIM  not the phone  which determines the phone number of the phone and the billing for calls made from the phone   Japan was the first country to adopt 3G technologies  and since they had not used GSM previously they had no need to build GSM compatibility into their handsets and their 3G handsets were smaller than those available elsewhere  In 2002  NTT DoCoMo s FOMA 3G network was the first commercial UMTS network—using a pre release specification  it was initially incompatible with the UMTS standard at the radio level but used standard USIM cards  meaning USIM card based roaming was possible  transferring the USIM card into a UMTS or GSM phone when travelling   Both NTT DoCoMo and SoftBank Mobile  which launched 3G in December 2002  now use standard UMTS   4 1  Handsets and modems  All of the major 2G phone manufacturers  that are still in business  are now manufacturers of 3G phones  The early 3G handsets and modems were specific to the frequencies required in their country  which meant they could only roam to other countries on the same 3G frequency  though they can fall back to the older GSM standard   Canada and USA have a common share of frequencies  as do most European countries  The article UMTS frequency bands is an overview of UMTS network frequencies around the world   Using a cellular router  PCMCIA or USB card  customers are able to access 3G broadband services  regardless of their choice of computer  such as a tablet PC or a PDA   Some software installs itself from the modem  so that in some cases absolutely no knowledge of technology is required to get online in moments  Using a phone that supports 3G and Bluetooth 2 0  multiple Bluetooth capable laptops can be connected to the Internet  Some smartphones can also act as a mobile WLAN access point   There are very few 3G phones or modems available supporting all 3G frequencies  UMTS850 900 1700 1900 2100 MHz   Nokia has recently released a range of phones that have Pentaband 3G coverage  including the N8 and E7  Many other phones are offering more than one band which still enables extensive roaming  For example  Apple s iPhone 4 contains a quadband chipset operating on 850 900 1900 2100 MHz  allowing usage in the majority of countries where UMTS FDD is deployed   5  Other competing standards  The main competitor to UMTS is CDMA2000  IMT MC   which is developed by the 3GPP2  Unlike UMTS  CDMA2000 is an evolutionary upgrade to an existing 2G standard  cdmaOne  and is able to operate within the same frequency allocations  This and CDMA2000 s narrower bandwidth requirements make it easier to deploy in existing spectra  In some  but not all  cases  existing GSM operators only have enough spectrum to implement either UMTS or GSM  not both  For example  in the US   the amount of spectrum available is 5 MHz in each direction  A standard UMTS system would saturate that spectrum  Where CDMA2000 is deployed  it usually co exists with UMTS  In many markets however  the co existence issue is of little relevance  as legislative hurdles exist to co deploying two standards in the same licensed slice of spectrum   Another competitor to UMTS is EDGE  IMT SC   which is an evolutionary upgrade to the 2G GSM system  leveraging existing GSM spectrums  It is also much easier  quicker  and considerably cheaper for wireless carriers to  bolt on  EDGE functionality by upgrading their existing GSM transmission hardware to support EDGE rather than having to install almost all brand new equipment to deliver UMTS  However  being developed by 3GPP just as UMTS  EDGE is not a true competitor  Instead  it is used as a temporary solution preceding UMTS roll out or as a complement for rural areas  This is facilitated by the fact that GSM EDGE and UMTS specification are jointly developed and rely on the same core network  allowing dual mode operation including vertical handovers   China s TD SCDMA standard is often seen as a competitor  too  TD SCDMA has been added to UMTS  Release 4 as UTRA TDD 1 28 Mcps Low Chip Rate  UTRA TDD LCR   Unlike TD CDMA  UTRA TDD 3 84 Mcps High Chip Rate  UTRA TDD HCR  which complements W CDMA  UTRA FDD   it is suitable for both micro and macro cells  However  the lack of vendors  support is preventing it from being a real competitor   While DECT is technically capable of competing with UMTS and other cellular networks in densely populated  urban areas  it has only been deployed for domestic cordless phones and private in house networks   All of these competitors have been accepted by ITU as part of the IMT 2000 family of 3G standards  along with UMTS FDD   On the Internet access side  competing systems include WiMAX and Flash OFDM   6  Migrating from GSM GPRS to UMTS  From a GSM GPRS network  the following network elements can be reused   Home Location Register  HLR   Visitor Location Register  VLR   Equipment Identity Register  EIR   Mobile Switching Center  MSC   vendor dependent   Authentication Center  AUC   Serving GPRS Support Node  SGSN   vendor dependent   Gateway GPRS Support Node  GGSN  From a GSM GPRS communication radio network  the following elements cannot be reused   Base station controller  BSC   Base transceiver station  BTS  They can remain in the network and be used in dual network operation where 2G and 3G networks co exist while network migration and new 3G terminals become available for use in the network   The UMTS network introduces new network elements that function as specified by 3GPP   Node B  base transceiver station   Radio Network Controller  RNC   Media Gateway  MGW  The functionality of MSC and SGSN changes when going to UMTS  In a GSM system the MSC handles all the circuit switched operations like connecting A  and B subscriber through the network  SGSN handles all the packet switched operations and transfers all the data in the network  In UMTS the Media gateway  MGW  take care of all data transfer in both circuit and packet switched networks  MSC and SGSN control MGW operations  The nodes are renamed to MSC server and GSN server   7  Problems and issues  Some countries  including the United States  have allocated spectrum differently from the ITU recommendations  so that the standard bands most commonly used for UMTS  UMTS 2100  have not been available  In those countries  alternative bands are used  preventing the interoperability of existing UMTS 2100 equipment  and requiring the design and manufacture of different equipment for the use in these markets  As is the case with GSM900 today  standard UMTS 2100 MHz equipment will not work in those markets  However  it appears as though UMTS is not suffering as much from handset band compatibility issues as GSM did  as many UMTS handsets are multi band in both UMTS and GSM modes  Penta band  850  900  1700   2100  and 1900 MHz bands   quad band GSM  850  900  1800  and 1900 MHz bands  and tri band UMTS  850  1900  and 2100 MHz bands  handsets are becoming more commonplace   In its early days  UMTS had problems in many countries  Overweight handsets with poor battery life were first to arrive on a market highly sensitive to weight and form factor  The Motorola A830  a debut handset on Hutchison s 3 network  weighed more than 200 grams and even featured a detachable camera to reduce handset weight  Another significant issue involved call reliability  related to problems with handover from UMTS to GSM  Customers found their connections being dropped as handovers were possible only in one direction  UMTS → GSM   with the handset only changing back to UMTS after hanging up  In most networks around the world this is no longer an issue   Compared to GSM  UMTS networks initially required a higher base station density  For fully fledged UMTS incorporating video on demand features  one base station needed to be set up every 1–1 5 km  0 62–0 93 mi   This was the case when only the 2100 MHz band was being used  however with the growing use of lower frequency bands  such as 850 and 900 MHz  this is no longer so  This has led to increasing rollout of the lower band networks by operators since 2006   Even with current technologies and low band UMTS  telephony and data over UMTS requires more power than on comparable GSM networks  Apple Inc  cited UMTS power consumption as the reason that the first generation iPhone only supported EDGE  Their release of the iPhone 3G quotes talk time on UMTS as half that available when the handset is set to use GSM  Other manufacturers indicate different battery lifetime for UMTS mode compared to GSM mode as well  As battery and network technology improve  this issue is diminishing   7 1  Security issues  As early as 2008 it was known that carrier networks can be used to surreptitiously gather user location information  In August 2014  the Washington Post reported on widespread marketing of surveillance systems using Signalling System No  7  SS7  protocols to locate callers anywhere in the world   In December 2014  news broke that SS7 s very own functions can be repurposed for surveillance  because of its lax security  in order to listen to calls in real time or to record encrypted calls and texts for later decryption or to defraud users and cellular carriers   The German Telekom and Vodafone declared the same day that they had fixed gaps in their networks  but that the problem is global and can only be fixed with a telecommunication system wide solution   8  Releases  The evolution of UMTS progresses according to planned releases  Each release is designed to introduce new features and improve upon
