The Kaman SH 2 Seasprite is a ship based helicopter  originally developed in the late 1950s as a fast utility helicopter for the United States Navy  In the 1970s  anti submarine  anti surface threat capabilities were added to the design  including over the horizon targeting  resulting in modifying most existing UH 2 models to the SH 2 Seasprite   This aircraft extends and increases shipboard sensor and weapon capabilities against several types of enemy threats  including submarines of all types  surface ships and patrol craft that may be armed with anti ship missiles  It served with the U S  Navy from the 1960s until the last SH 2G helicopters were retired in 2001   1  Design and development  1 1  Origins  In 1956  the U S  Navy launched a competition to meet its requirement for a compact  all weather multipurpose naval helicopter  Kaman s K 20 model was selected as the winner  Kaman was awarded a contract for four prototype and 12 production HU2K 1 helicopters in late 1957  Kaman s design was for a conventional helicopter powered by a single General Electric T58 8F turboshaft engine  driving a 44 foot four bladed main rotor and a four bladed tail rotor   In 1960  the Royal Canadian Navy announced that the HU2K was the frontrunner for a large anti submarine warfare contract  the Canadian Treasury Board had approved an initial procurement of 12 units for $14 5 million  Abruptly  Kaman raised the estimated price to $23 million  and there was concern that the manufacturer s weight and performance projections were overly optimistic  The Naval Board decided to wait until after the US Navy had conducted sea trials before approving the purchase  These trials revealed the HU2K to be overweight and underpowered  and thus incapable of meeting Canadian requirements  Hence  in late 1961  the Sikorsky Sea King was selected   With no follow on orders  Kaman ended production in the late 1960s after delivering 184 SH 2s to the U S  Navy  production was later restarted in 1971 to manufacture an improved variant of the helicopter  the SH 2F  A significant factor in the reopening of the production line was that the Navy s Sikorsky SH 60 Sea Hawk  which was newer and more capable in anti submarine operations  was too large to be operated from the small flight decks of older frigates   1 2  Further development  Upon enactment of the 1962 United States Tri Service aircraft designation system  the HU2K 1 was redesignated UH 2A and the HU2K 1U was redesignated UH 2B  In service  the UH 2 Seasprite would see several modifications and improvements  such as the addition of fixtures for mounting external stores  Beginning in 1968  the Navy s remaining UH 2s were extensively remanufactured  their single engines being replaced by a twin engine arrangement   The UH 2 was selected to be the airframe for the interim Light Airborne Multi Purpose System  LAMPS  helicopter in October 1970  LAMPS evolved in the late 1960s from an urgent requirement to develop a manned helicopter that would support a non aviation ship and serve as its tactical Anti Submarine Warfare arm  Known as LAMPS Mark I  the advanced sensors  processors  and display capabilities aboard the helicopter enabled ships to extend their situational awareness beyond the line of sight limitations that hamper shipboard radars and the short distances for acoustic detection and prosecution of underwater threats associated with hull mounted sonars  H 2s reconfigured for the LAMPS mission were redesignated SH 2D  On 16 March 1971  the first SH 2D LAMPS prototype first flew   The full LAMPS I system was equipped on the SH 2F  The SH 2F was delivered to the Navy beginning in 1973  This variant had upgraded engines  longer life rotor  and higher take off weight  In 1981  the Navy ordered 60 production SH 2Fs  Beginning in 1987  16 SH 2Fs were upgraded with chin mounted Forward Looking Infrared Sensors  FLIR   Chaff  AIRBOC  Flares  dual rear mounted IR scramblers  and Missile Mine detecting equipment   Eventually all but two H 2s then in Navy inventory were remanufactured into SH 2Fs  The final production procurement of the SH 2F was in Fiscal Year 1986  The last six orders for production SH 2Fs were switched to the SH 2G Super Seasprite variant   2  Operational history  2 1  United States  The UH 2 began entering operational service in 1962  The Navy soon found the helicopter s capabilities to be restricted by its single engine  and ordered Kaman to retrofit all of its Seasprites with a twin engine arrangement instead  with two engines the Seasprite was capable of reaching an airspeed of 130 knots and operating at a range of up to 411 nautical miles  The Navy would operate a total fleet of nearly 200 Seasprites for various duties  such as anti submarine warfare  ASW   search and rescue  SAR  and transportation  Typically  several UH 2s would be deployed upon an aircraft carrier to perform plane guard and SAR missions   The UH 2 was introduced in time to see action in the Tonkin Gulf incident in August 1964  the Seasprite s principal contribution to what would become the Vietnam War was the retrieval of downed aircrews  both from the sea and from inside enemy territory  and was increasingly relied upon in this mission as the war intensified  such as during Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965  In October 1966 alone  out of 269 downed pilots  helicopter based SAR teams were able to recover 103 men   In the 1970s  the conversion of UH 2s to the SH 2 anti submarine configuration provided the US Navy with its first ASW helicopter capable of operating from vessels other than its aircraft carriers  The small size of the SH 2 allowed it to be operated from flight decks that were too small for most helicopters  this being a factor in the Navy s decision to acquire the improved SH 2F in the early 1980s   SH 2Fs were utilized to enforce and support Operation Earnest Will in July 1987  Operation Praying Mantis in April 1988  and Operation Desert Storm during January 1991 in the Persian Gulf region  The countermeasures and additional equipment on the SH 2F allowed it to conduct combat support and surface warfare missions in these hostile environments  which had an often minimal threat from submarines  The SH 2F was retired from active service in October 1993  at roughly the same time that the Navy retired the last of its Vietnam era Knox Class Frigates that were unable to accommodate the larger SH 60 Sea Hawk   In 1991  the US Navy began to receive deliveries of the new SH 2G Super Seasprite  a total of 18 converted SH 2Fs and 6 new built SH 2Gs were produced  These were assigned to Naval Reserve squadrons  the SH 2G entered service with HSL 84 in 1993  The SH 2 served in some 600 deployments and flew 1 5 million flight hours before the last of the type were finally retired in mid 2001   2 2  New Zealand  The Royal New Zealand Navy  RNZN  replaced its Westland Wasps with four interim SH 2F Seasprites  ex US Navy   operated and maintained by a mix of Navy and Air Force personnel known as No  3 Squadron RNZAF Naval Support Flight  to operate with ANZAC class frigates until the fleet of five new SH 2G Super Seasprites were delivered  The Navy air element was transferred to No  6 Squadron RNZAF at RNZAF Base Auckland in Whenuapai in October 2005  RNZN Seasprites have seen service in East Timor  Six additional SH 2Fs rejected by the Royal Australian Navy were purchased and are now stationed at the RNZAF Ground Training Wing  GTW  at Woodbourne near Blenheim as training helicopters  An SH 2F  ex RNZN  NZ3442  is preserved in the Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum  donated to the museum by Kaman Aircraft Corporation after an accident while in service with the RNZN   2 3  Exports  In the late 1990s the United States offered surplus U S  Navy SH 2Fs as foreign aid to a number of countries  Greece which had been offered six and Turkey which had been offered 14 rejected the offer  Egypt acquired four SH 2F aircraft under the aid program mainly for spares to support a fleet of ten SH 2Gs  Poland acquired the later SH 2G   3  Variants   YHU2K 1  Four test and evaluation prototypes powered by an 875 shp General Electric T58 GE 6 turboshaft engine  Later redesignated YUH 2A in 1962   HU2K 1  Utility transport helicopter  powered by a 1 250 shp  932 kW
