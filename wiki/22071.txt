Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  usually abbreviated to NSAIDs    also called nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents analgesics  NSAIAs  or nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medicines  NSAIMs   are a class of drugs that provides analgesic  pain killing  and antipyretic  fever reducing  effects  and  in higher doses  anti inflammatory effects   The term nonsteroidal distinguishes these drugs from steroids  which  among a broad range of other effects  have a similar eicosanoid depressing  anti inflammatory action  As analgesics  NSAIDs are unusual in that they are non narcotic and thus are used as a non addictive alternative to narcotics   The most prominent members of this group of drugs  aspirin  ibuprofen and naproxen  are all available over the counter in most countries  Paracetamol  acetaminophen  is generally not considered an NSAID because it has only little anti inflammatory activity  It treats pain mainly by blocking COX 2 mostly in the central nervous system  but not much in the rest of the body   NSAIDs inhibit the activity of both cyclooxygenase 1  COX 1  and cyclooxygenase 2  COX 2   and thereby  the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes  It is thought that inhibiting COX 2 leads to the anti inflammatory  analgesic and antipyretic effects and that those NSAIDs also inhibiting COX 1  particularly aspirin  may cause gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers   1  Medical uses  NSAIDs are usually used for the treatment of acute or chronic conditions where pain and inflammation are present  Research continues into their potential for prevention of colorectal cancer   NSAIDs are generally used for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions   Osteoarthritis  Rheumatoid arthritis  Mild to moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury  Low back pain  Inflammatory arthropathies  e g   ankylosing spondylitis  psoriatic arthritis  Reiter s syndrome   Tennis elbow  Headache  migraine  Acute gout  Dysmenorrhoea  menstrual pain   Metastatic bone pain  Postoperative pain  Muscle stiffness and pain due to Parkinson s disease  Pyrexia  fever   Ileus  Renal colic  They are also given to neonate infants whose ductus arteriosus is not closed within 24 hours of birth Aspirin  the only NSAID able to irreversibly inhibit COX 1  is also indicated for inhibition of platelet aggregation  This is useful in the management of arterial thrombosis and prevention of adverse cardiovascular events  Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by inhibiting the action of thromboxane A2   2  Contraindications  NSAIDs may be used with caution by people with the following conditions   Irritable bowel syndrome  Persons who are over age 50  and who have a family history of GI problems  Persons who have had past GI problems from NSAID use NSAIDs should usually be avoided by people with the following conditions   Peptic ulcer or stomach bleeding  uncontrolled hypertension  kidney disease  a past transient ischemic attack  excluding Aspirin   a past stroke  excluding Aspirin   a past Myocardial infarction  excluding Aspirin   Coronary artery disease  excluding Aspirin   undergoing Coronary artery bypass surgery  taking aspirin for heart  in third trimester of pregnancy  3  Adverse effects  The widespread use of NSAIDs has meant that the adverse effects of these drugs have become increasingly prevalent  Use of NSAIDs increases risk of having a range of gastrointestinal  GI  problems  When NSAIDs are used for pain management after surgery they cause increased risk of kidney problems   An estimated 10 20% of NSAID patients experience dyspepsia  In the 1990s high doses of prescription NSAIDs were associated with serious upper gastrointestinal adverse events  including bleeding  Over the past decade  deaths associated with gastric bleeding have declined   NSAIDs  like all drugs  may interact with other medications  For example  concurrent use of NSAIDs and quinolones may increase the risk of quinolones  adverse central nervous system effects  including seizure   3 1  Combinational risk  If a COX 2 inhibitor is taken  a traditional NSAID  prescription or over the counter  should not be taken at the same time  In addition  people on daily aspirin therapy  e g   for reducing cardiovascular risk  must be careful if they also use other NSAIDs  as these may inhibit the cardioprotective effects of aspirin   Rofecoxib was shown to produce significantly fewer gastrointestinal ADRs compared with naproxen  This study  the VIGOR trial  raised the issue of the cardiovascular safety of the coxibs  A statistically insignificant increase in the incidence of myocardial infarctions was observed in patients on rofecoxib  Further data  from the APPROVe trial  showed a statistically significant relative risk of cardiovascular events of 1 97 versus placebo—which caused a worldwide withdrawal of rofecoxib in October 2004   Use of methotrexate together with NSAIDS in rheumatoid arthritis is safe  if adequate monitoring is done   3 2  Cardiovascular  NSAIDs aside from aspirin  both newer selective COX 2 inhibitors and traditional anti inflammatories  increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke  They are not recommended in those who have had a previous heart attack as they increase the risk of death and   or recurrent MI  Naproxen seems least harmful   NSAIDs aside from  low dose  aspirin are associated with a doubled risk of heart failure in people without a history of cardiac disease  In people with such a history  use of NSAIDs  aside from low dose aspirin  was associated with a more than 10 fold increase in heart failure  If this link is proven causal  researchers estimate that NSAIDs would be responsible for up to 20 percent of hospital admissions for congestive heart failure  In people with heart failure  NSAIDs increase mortality risk  hazard ratio  by approximately 1 2 1 3 for naproxen and ibuprofen  1 7 for rofecoxib and celecoxib  and 2 1 for diclofenac   3 3  Possible Erectile dysfunction risk  A 2005 Finnish study linked long term  over 3 months  use of NSAIDs with an increased risk of erectile dysfunction  This study was correlational only  and depended solely on self reports  questionnaires    A 2011 publication in the Journal of Urology received widespread publicity  According to this study  men who used NSAIDs regularly were at significantly increased risk of erectile dysfunction  A link between NSAID use and erectile dysfunction still existed after controlling for several conditions  However  the study was observational and not controlled  with low original participation rate  potential participation bias  and other uncontrolled factors  The authors warned against drawing any conclusion regarding cause   3 4  Gastrointestinal  The main adverse drug reactions  ADRs  associated with NSAID use relate to direct and indirect irritation of the gastrointestinal  GI  tract  NSAIDs cause a dual assault on the GI tract  the acidic molecules directly irritate the gastric mucosa  and inhibition of COX 1 and COX 2 reduces the levels of protective prostaglandins  Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the GI tract causes increased gastric acid secretion  diminished bicarbonate secretion  diminished mucus secretion and diminished trophic effects on epithelial mucosa   Common gastrointestinal ADRs include   Nausea Vomiting  Dyspepsia  Gastric ulceration bleeding   Diarrhea Clinical NSAID ulcers are related to the systemic effects of NSAID administration  Such damage occurs irrespective of the route of administration of the NSAID  e g   oral  rectal  or parenteral  and can occur even in patients with achlorhydria   Ulceration risk increases with therapy duration  and with higher doses  To minimise GI ADRs  it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time—a practice that studies show is often not followed  Recent studies show that over 50% of patients who take NSAIDs have sustained some mucosal damage to their small intestine   There are also some differences in the propensity of individual agents to cause gastrointestinal ADRs  Indomethacin  ketoprofen and piroxicam appear to have the highest prevalence of gastric ADRs  while ibuprofen  lower doses  and diclofenac appear to have lower rates   Certain NSAIDs  such as aspirin  have been marketed in enteric coated formulations that manufacturers claim reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal ADRs  Similarly  some believe that rectal formulations may reduce gastrointestinal ADRs  However  considering the mechanism of such ADRs  and in clinical practice  these formulations have not demonstrated a reduced risk of GI ulceration   Commonly  gastric  but not necessarily intestinal  adverse effects can be reduced through suppressing acid production  by concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor  e g   omeprazole  esomeprazole  or the prostaglandin analogue misoprostol  Misoprostol is itself associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal ADRs  diarrhea   While these techniques may be effective  they are expensive for maintenance therapy   3 5  Inflammatory bowel disease  NSAIDs should be used with caution in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease  e g   Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis  due to their tendency to cause gastric bleeding and form ulceration in the gastric lining  Pain relievers such as paracetamol  also known as acetaminophen  or drugs containing codeine  which slows down bowel activity  are safer medications for pain relief in IBD   3 6  Renal  NSAIDs are also associated with a relatively high incidence of renal adverse drug reactions  ADRs   The mechanism of these renal ADRs is due to changes in renal haemodynamics  kidney blood flow   ordinarily mediated by prostaglandins  which are affected by NSAIDs  Prostaglandins normally cause vasodilation of the afferent arterioles of the glomeruli  This helps maintain normal glomerular perfusion and glomerular filtration rate  GFR   an indicator of renal function  This is particularly important in renal failure where the kidney is trying to maintain renal perfusion pressure by elevated angiotensin II levels  At these elevated levels  angiotensin II also constricts the afferent arteriole into the glomerulus in addition to the efferent arteriole it normally constricts  Prostaglandins serve to dilate the afferent arteriole  by blocking this prostaglandin mediated effect  particularly in renal failure  NSAIDs cause unopposed constriction of the afferent arteriole and decreased renal perfusion pressure   Common ADRs associated with altered renal function include   Salt  Sodium  and fluid retention  Hypertension  high blood pressure  These agents may also cause renal impairment  especially in combination with other nephrotoxic agents  Renal failure is especially a risk if the patient is also concomitantly taking an ACE inhibitor  which removes angiotensin II s vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole  and a diuretic  which drops plasma volume  and thereby RPF —the so called  triple whammy  effect   In rarer instances NSAIDs may also cause more severe renal conditions   Interstitial nephritis  Nephrotic syndrome  Acute renal failure  Acute tubular necrosis NSAIDs in combination with excessive use of phenacetin and or paracetamol  acetaminophen  may lead to analgesic nephropathy   3 7  Photosensitivity  Photosensitivity is a commonly overlooked adverse effect of many of the NSAIDs  The 2 arylpropionic acids are the most likely to produce photosensitivity reactions  but other NSAIDs have also been implicated including piroxicam  diclofenac and benzydamine   Benoxaprofen  since withdrawn due to its hepatotoxicity  was the most photoactive NSAID observed  The mechanism of photosensitivity  responsible for the high photoactivity of the 2 arylpropionic acids  is the ready decarboxylation of the carboxylic acid moiety  The specific absorbance characteristics of the different chromophoric 2 aryl substituents  affects the decarboxylation mechanism  While ibuprofen has weak absorption  it has been reported as a weak photosensitising agent   3 8  During pregnancy  NSAIDs are not recommended during pregnancy  particularly during the third trimester  While NSAIDs as a class are not direct teratogens  they may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and renal ADRs in the fetus  Additionally  they are linked with premature birth and miscarriage  Aspirin  however  is used together with heparin in pregnant women with antiphospholipid antibodies  Additionally  Indomethacin is used in pregnancy to treat polyhydramnios by reducing fetal urine production via inhibiting fetal renal blood flow   In contrast  paracetamol  acetaminophen  is regarded as being safe and well tolerated during pregnancy  but Leffers et al  released a study in 2010 indicating that there may be associated male infertility in the unborn  Doses should be taken as prescribed  due to risk of hepatotoxicity with overdoses   In France  the country s health agency contraindicates the use of NSAIDs  including aspirin  after the sixth month of pregnancy   3 9  Other  Common adverse drug reactions  ADR   other than listed above  include  raised liver enzymes  headache  dizziness  Uncommon ADRs include  hyperkalaemia  confusion  bronchospasm  rash  Rapid and severe swelling of the face and or body  Ibuprofen may also rarely cause irritable bowel syndrome symptoms  NSAIDs are also implicated in some cases of Stevens–Johnson syndrome   Most NSAIDs penetrate poorly into the central nervous system  CNS   However  the COX enzymes are expressed constitutively in some areas of the CNS  meaning that even limited penetration may cause adverse effects such as somnolence and dizziness   In very rare cases  ibuprofen can cause aseptic meningitis   As with other drugs  allergies to NSAIDs might exist  While many allergies are specific to one NSAID  up to 1 in 5 people may have unpredictable cross reactive allergic responses to other NSAIDs as well   3 10  Drug interactions  NSAIDs reduce renal blood flow and thereby decrease the efficacy of diuretics  and inhibit the elimination of lithium and methotrexate   NSAIDs cause hypocoagulability  which may be serious when combined with other drugs that also decrease blood clotting  such as warfarin   NSAIDs may aggravate hypertension  high blood pressure  and thereby antagonize the effect of antihypertensives  such as ACE Inhibitors   NSAIDs may interfere and reduce efficiency of SSRI antidepressants  4  Mechanism of action  Most NSAIDs act as nonselective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase  COX   inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase 1  COX 1  and cyclooxygenase 2  COX 2  isoenzymes  This inhibition is competitively reversible  albeit at varying degrees of reversibility   as opposed to the mechanism of aspirin  which is irreversible inhibition  COX catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid  itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2   Prostaglandins act  among other things  as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation  This mechanism of action was elucidated by John Vane  1927–2004   who received a Nobel Prize for his work  see Mechanism of action of aspirin    COX 1 is a constitutively expressed enzyme with a  house keeping  role in regulating many normal physiological processes  One of these is in the stomach lining  where prostaglandins serve a protective role  preventing the stomach mucosa from being eroded by its own acid  COX 2 is an enzyme facultatively expressed in inflammation  and it is inhibition of COX 2 that produces the desirable effects of NSAIDs   When nonselective COX 1 COX 2 inhibitors  such as aspirin  ibuprofen  and naproxen  lower stomach prostaglandin levels  ulcers of the stomach or duodenum internal bleeding can result   NSAIDs have been studied in various assays to understand how they affect each of these enzymes  While the assays reveal differences  unfortunately different assays provide differing ratios   The discovery of COX 2 led to research to development of selective COX 2 inhibiting drugs that do not cause gastric problems characteristic of older NSAIDs   Paracetamol  acetaminophen  is not considered an NSAID because it has little anti inflammatory activity  It treats pain mainly by blocking COX 2 mostly in the central nervous system  but not much in the rest of the body   However  many aspects of the mechanism of action of NSAIDs remain unexplained  and for this reason further COX pathways are hypothesized  The COX 3 pathway was believed to fill some of this gap but recent findings make it appear unlikely that it plays any significant role in humans and alternative explanation models are proposed   NSAIDs are also used in the acute pain caused by gout because they inhibit urate crystal phagocytosis besides inhibition of prostaglandin synthase   4 1  Antipyretic activity  NSAIDS have antipyretic activity and can be used to treat fever  Fever is caused by elevated levels of prostaglandin E2  which alters the firing rate of neurons within the hypothalamus that control thermoregulation  Antipyretics work by inhibiting the enzyme COX  which causes the general inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis  PGE2  within the hypothalamus  PGE2 signals to the hypothalamus to increase the body s thermal set point  Ibuprofen has been shown more effective as an antipyretic than paracetamol  acetaminophen   Arachidonic acid is the precursor substrate for cyclooxygenase leading to the production of prostaglandins F  D & E   5  Classification  NSAIDs can be classified based on their chemical structure or mechanism of action  Older NSAIDs were known long before their mechanism of action was elucidated and were for this reason classified by chemical structure or origin  Newer substances are more often classified by mechanism of action   5 1  Salicylates  Aspirin  acetylsalicylic acid   Diflunisal  Dolobid   Salicylic acid and other salicylates  Salsalate  Disalcid   5 2  Propionic acid derivatives  Ibuprofen  Dexibuprofen  Naproxen  Fenoprofen  Ketoprofen  Dexketoprofen  Flurbiprofen  Oxaprozin  Loxoprofen  5 3  Acetic acid derivatives  Indomethacin  Tolmetin  Sulindac  Etodolac  Ketorolac  Diclofenac  Safety alert by FDA   Aceclofenac  Nabumetone  drug itself is non acidic but the active  principal metabolite has a carboxylic acid group   5 4  Enolic acid  Oxicam  derivatives  Piroxicam  Meloxicam  Tenoxicam  Droxicam  Lornoxicam  Isoxicam  5 5  Anthranilic acid derivatives  Fenamates    Mefenamic acid  Meclofenamic acid  Flufenamic acid  Tolfenamic acid  5 6  Selective COX 2 inhibitors  Coxibs   Celecoxib  FDA alert   Rofecoxib  withdrawn from market   Valdecoxib  withdrawn from market   Parecoxib FDA withdrawn  licenced in the EU  Lumiracoxib TGA cancelled registration  Etoricoxib not FDA approved  licenced in the EU  Firocoxib used in dogs and horses  5 7  Sulfonanilides  Nimesulide  systemic preparations are banned by several countries for the potential risk of hepatotoxicity   5 8  Others  Clonixin  Licofelone acts by inhibiting LOX  lipooxygenase  & COX and hence known as 5 LOX COX inhibitor  H harpagide in Figwort or Devil s Claw  5 9  Chirality  Most NSAIDs are chiral molecules  diclofenac is a notable exception   However  the majority are prepared in a racemic mixture  Typically  only a single enantiomer is pharmacologically active  For some drugs  typically profens   an isomerase enzyme in vivo converts the inactive enantiomer into the active form  although its activity varies widely in individuals  This phenomenon is likely responsible for the poor correlation between NSAID efficacy and plasma concentration observed in older studies  when specific analysis of the active enantiomer was not performed   Ibuprofen and ketoprofen are now available in single  active enantiomer preparations  dexibuprofen and dexketoprofen   which purport to offer quicker onset and an improved side effect profile  Naproxen has always been marketed as the single active enantiomer   5 10  Main practical differences  NSAIDs within a group tend to have similar characteristics and tolerability  There is little difference in clinical efficacy among the NSAIDs when used at equivalent doses  Rather  differences among compounds usually relate to dosing regimens  related to the compound s elimination half life   route of administration  and tolerability profile   Regarding adverse effects  selective COX 2 inhibitors have lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding  but a substantially more increased risk of myocardial infarction than the increased risk from nonselective inhibitors  Some data also supports that the partially selective nabumetone is less likely to cause gastrointestinal events  The nonselective naproxen appears risk neutral with regard to cardiovascular events   A consumer report noted that ibuprofen  naproxen  and salsalate are less expensive than other NSAIDs  and essentially as effective and safe when used appropriately to treat osteoarthritis and pain   6  Pharmacokinetics  Most nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs are weak acids  with a pKa of 3 5  They are absorbed well from the stomach and intestinal mucosa  They are highly protein bound in plasma  typically  95%   usually to albumin  so that their volume of distribution typically approximates to plasma volume  Most NSAIDs are metabolised in the liver by oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites that typically are excreted in the urine  though some drugs are partially excreted in bile  Metabolism may be abnormal in certain disease states  and accumulation may occur even with normal dosage   Ibuprofen and diclofenac have short half lives  2–3 hours   Some NSAIDs  typically oxicams  have very long half lives  e g  20–60 hours    7  History  From the era of Greek medicine to the mid 19th century  the discovery of medicinal agents was classed as an empirical art  folklore and mythological guidance were combined in deploying the vegetable and mineral products that made up the expansive pharmacopoeia of the time  Myrtle leaves were in use by 1500 BCE  Hippocrates  460   377 BCE  first reported using willow bark and in 30 BCE Celsus described the signs of inflammation and also used willow bark to mitigate them  On April 25  1763  Edward Stone wrote to the Royal Society describing his observations on the use of willow bark based medicines in febrile patients  The active ingredient of willow bark  a glycoside called salicin  was first isolated by Johann Andreas Buchner in 1827  By 1829  French chemist Henri Leroux had improved the extraction process to obtain about 30g of purified salicin from 1 5 kg of bark   By hydrolysis  salicin releases glucose and salicylic alcohol which can be converted into salicylic acid  both in vivo and through chemical methods  The acid is more effective than salicin and  in addition to its fever reducing properties  is anti inflammatory and analgesic  In 1869  Hermann Kolbe synthesised salicylate  although it was too acidic for the gastric mucosa  The reaction used to synthesise aromatic acid from a phenol in the presence of CO2 is known as the Kolbe Schmitt reaction   By 1897 the German chemist Felix Hoffmann and the Bayer company prompted a new age of pharmacology by converting salicylic acid into acetylsalicylic acid—named aspirin by Heinrich Dreser  Other NSAIDs were developed from the 1950s forward   In 2001  NSAIDs accounted for 70 000 000 prescriptions and 30 billion over the counter doses sold annually in the United States   8  Veterinary use  Research supports the use of NSAIDs for the control of pain associated with veterinary procedures such as dehorning and castration of calves  The best effect is obtained by combining a short term local anesthetic such as lidocaine with an NSAID acting as a longer term analgesic  However  as different species have varying reactions to different medications in the NSAID family  little of the existing research data can be extrapolated to animal species other than those specifically studied  and the relevant government agency in one area sometimes prohibits uses approved in other jurisdictions   For example  ketoprofen s effects have been studied in horses more than in ruminants but  due to controversy over its use in racehorses  veterinarians who treat livestock in the United States more commonly prescribe flunixin meglumine  which  while labeled for use in such animals  is not indicated for post operative pain   In the United States  meloxicam is approved for use only in canines  whereas  due to concerns about liver damage  it carries warnings against its use in cats except for one time use during surgery  In spite of these warnings  meloxicam is frequently prescribed  off label  for non canine animals including cats and livestock species  In other countries  for example The European Union  EU   there is a label claim for use in cats   9  References
