Psychophysiology  from Greek   psȳkhē   breath  life  soul     physis   nature  origin   and    logia  is the branch of psychology that is concerned with the physiological bases of psychological processes  While psychophysiology was a general broad field of research in the 1960s and 1970s  it has now become quite specialized  and has branched into subspecializations  For example  social psychophysiology  cardiovascular psychophysiology  cognitive psychophysiology  and cognitive neuroscience   1  Background  Some people have difficulty distinguishing a psychophysiologist from a physiological psychologist  two very different perspectives  Psychologists are interested in why we may fear spiders and physiologists may be interested in the input output system of the amygdala  A psychophysiologist will attempt to link the two  Psychophysiologists generally study the psychological physiological link in intact human subjects  While early psychophysiologists almost always examined the impact of psychological states on physiological system responses  since the 1970s  psychophysiologists also frequently study the impact of physiological states and systems on psychological states and processes  It is this perspective of studying the interface of mind and body that makes psychophysiologists most distinct   Historically  most psychophysiologists tended to examine the physiological responses and organ systems innervated by the autonomic nervous system  More recently  psychophysiologists have been equally  or potentially more  interested in the central nervous system  exploring cortical brain potentials such as the many types of event related potentials  ERPs   brain waves  and utilizing advanced technology such as functional magnetic resonance imaging  fMRI   MRI  PET  MEG  and other neuroimagery techniques   Continuing the comparison between a psychophysiologist and a physiological psychologist  a psychophysiologist may look at how exposure to a stressful situation will produce a result in the cardiovascular system such as a change in heart rate  HR   vasodilation vasoconstriction  myocardial contractility  or stroke volume  A physiological psychologist may look at how one cardiovascular event may influence another cardiovascular or endocrine event  or how activation of one neural brain structure exerts excitatory activity in another neural structure which then induces an inhibitory effect in some other system  Often  physiological psychologists examine the effects that they study in infrahuman subjects using surgical or invasive techniques and processes   Psychophysiology is closely related to the field of Neuroscience and Social neuroscience  which primarily concerns itself with relationships between psychological events and brain responses  Psychophysiology is also related to the medical discipline known as psychosomatics   While psychophysiology was a discipline off the mainstream of psychological and medical science prior to roughly the 1960 and 1970s  more recently  psychophysiology has found itself positioned at the intersection of psychological and medical science  and its popularity and importance have expanded commensurately with the realization of the inter relatedness of mind and body   2  Commonly used measures  Many measures are part of modern psychophysiology including measures of brain activity such as ERPs  brain waves  electroencephalography  EEG   fMRI  functional magnetic resonance imaging   measures of skin conductance  skin conductance response  SCR  galvanic skin response  GSR   cardiovascular measures  heart rate  HR  beats per minute  BPM  heart rate variability  HRV  vasomotor activity   muscle activity  electromyography  EMG   electrogastrogram  EGG  changes in pupil diameter with thought and emotion  pupillometry   eye movements  recorded via the electro oculogram  EOG  and direction of gaze methods  and cardiodynamics  recorded via impedance cardiography    3  Uses of psychophysiology  Psychophysiological measures are often used to study emotion and attention responses to stimuli  during exertion and increasingly  to better understand cognitive processes  Physiological sensors have been used to detect emotions in schools and intelligent tutoring systems   4  Psychophysiological inference and physiological computer games  Physiological computing represents a category of affective computing that incorporates real time software adaption to the psychophysiological activity of the user  The main goal of this is to build a computer that responds to user emotion  cognition and motivation  The approach is to enable implicit and symmetrical human computer communication by granting the software access to a representation of the user s psychological status   There are several possible methods to represent the psychological state of the user  discussed in the affective computing page   The advantages of using psychophysiological indices are that their changes are continuous  measures are covert and implicit  and only available data source when the user interacts with the computer without any explicit communication or input device  These systems rely upon an assumption that the psychophysiological measure is an accurate one to one representation of a relevant psychological dimension such as mental effort  task engagement and frustration   Physiological computing systems all contain an element that may be termed as an adaptive controller that may be used to represent the player  This adaptive controller represents the decision making process underlying software adaptation  In their simplest form  adaptive controllers are expressed in Boolean statements  Adaptive controllers encompass not only the decision making rules  but also the psychophysiological inference that is implicit in the quantification of those trigger points used to activate the rules  The representation of the player using an adaptive controller can become very complex and often only one dimensional  The loop used to describe this process is known as the biocybernetic loop  The biocybernetic loop describes the closed loop system that receives psychophysiological data from the player  transforms that data into a computerized response  which then shapes the future psychophysiological response from the player  A positive control loop tends towards instability as player software loop strives towards a higher standard of desirable performance  The physiological computer game may wish to incorporate both positive and negative loops into the adaptive controller   5  See also  Karl U  Smith  Vladimir Nebylitsyn  6  Sources  Bos  M  W   Dijksterhuis  A   & van Baaren  R   2012   Food for thought  Trust
