Mind control  also known as brainwashing  reeducation  coercive persuasion  thought control  or thought reform  is a theoretical indoctrination process which results in  an impairment of autonomy  an inability to think independently  and a disruption of beliefs and affiliations  In this context  brainwashing refers to the involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values   The term has been applied to any tactic  psychological or otherwise  which can be seen as subverting an individual s sense of control over their own thinking  behavior  emotions or decision making   Theories of brainwashing and of mind control were originally developed to explain how totalitarian regimes appeared to succeed systematically in indoctrinating prisoners of war through propaganda and torture techniques  These theories were later expanded and modified by psychologists including Jean Marie Abgrall and Margaret Singer to explain a wider range of phenomena  especially conversions to new religious movements  NRMs   A third generation theory proposed by Ben Zablocki focused on the use of mind control to retain members of NRMs and cults  The suggestion that NRMs use mind control techniques has resulted in scientific and legal controversy   1  The Korean War and the idea of brainwashing  1 1  Origin of the term  The Oxford English Dictionary records the earliest known English language usage of brainwashing in an article by newspaperman Edward Hunter  in Miami News  published on October 7th  1950  Hunter  said to be a CIA propagandist  wrote a series of books and articles on the theme of Chinese brainwashing  and the word brainwashing quickly became a stock phrase in Cold War headlines   The Chinese term  xǐ năo  literally  wash brain   was originally used to describe methodologies of coercive persuasion used under the Maoist government in China  which aimed to transform individuals with a reactionary imperialist mindset into  right thinking  members of the new Chinese social system  The term punned on the Taoist custom of  cleansing washing the heart mind     xǐ xīn  before conducting certain ceremonies or entering certain holy places   Hunter and those who picked up the Chinese term used it to explain why some American GI prisoners of war cooperated with their Chinese captors  even in a few cases defecting to the enemy side  British radio operator Robert W  Ford and British army Colonel James Carne also claimed that the Chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their war era imprisonment   The U S  military and government laid charges of  brainwashing  in an effort to undermine detailed confessions made by military personnel to war crimes  including biological warfare  After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote Frank Schwable  Chief of Staff of the First Marine Air Wing admitting to participating in germ warfare  United Nations commander Gen  Mark W  Clark asserted   Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful  If they did  however  too familiar are the mind annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want      The men themselves are not to blame  and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way    1 2  Korean War brainwashing debunked  Reexamining the concept of brainwashing after the war  in 1956 the U S Department of the Army published a report entitled Communist Interrogation  Indoctrination  and Exploitation of Prisoners of War which called brainwashing a  popular misconception   The report states  exhaustive research of several government agencies failed to reveal even one conclusively documented case of  brainwashing  of an American prisoner of war in Korea    US POW s captured by North Korea were brutalized with starvation  beatings  forced death marches  exposure to extremes of temperature  binding in stress positions  and withholding of medical care  but the abuse had no relation to indoctrination  in which  North Korea was  not particularly interested   In contrast American POW s in the custody of North Korea s Chinese Communist allies did face a concerted interrogation and indoctrination program  However   systematic  physical torture was not employed in connection with interrogation or indoctrination   the report states   Instead  the Chinese elicited information using tricks such as harmless seeming written questionnaires  followed by interviews  The  most insidious  and effective Chinese technique according to the US Army Report was a convivial display of false friendship  which persuaded some GI s to make anti American statements  and in a few isolated cases  refuse repatriation and remain in China     w hen an American soldier was captured by the Chinese  he was given a vigorous handshake and a pat on the back  The enemy  introduced  himself as a friend of the  workers  of America       in many instances the Chinese did not search the American captives  but frequently offered them American cigarettes  This display of friendship caught most Americans totally off guard and they never recovered from the initial impression made by the Chinese         A fter the initial contact with the enemy  some Americans seemed to believe that the enemy was sincere and harmless  They relaxed and permitted themselves to be lulled into a well disguised trap  of cooperating with  the cunning enemy   Two academic studies of the repatriation of American prisoners of war by Robert Jay Lifton and by Edgar Schein concluded that brainwashing  called  thought reform  by Lifton and  coercive persuasion  by Schein   if it occurred  had at best a transient effect  Both researchers found that the Chinese mainly used coercive persuasion to disrupt the ability of the prisoners to organize and maintain morale and hence to escape  By placing the prisoners under conditions of physical and social deprivation and disruption  and then by offering them more comfortable situations such as better sleeping quarters  better food  warmer clothes or blankets  the Chinese did succeed in getting some of the prisoners to make anti American statements   Nevertheless  the majority of prisoners did not actually adopt Communist beliefs  instead behaving as though they did in order to avoid the plausible threat of extreme physical abuse  Both researchers also concluded that such coercive persuasion succeeded only on a minority of POWs  and that the end result of such coercion remained very unstable  as most of the individuals reverted to their previous condition soon after they left the coercive environment  In 1961 they both published books expanding on these findings  Schein published Coercive Persuasion and Lifton published Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism   1 3  CIA mind control program  Largely in response to alleged Soviet  Chinese  and North Korean use of mind control techniques on U S  prisoners of war in Korea  the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  created its own secret mind control program in 1950  The CIA wanted to experiment with similar methods on their own captives   See also Sidney Gottlieb    Forensic psychologist Dick Anthony concluded that the CIA had invented the concept of  brainwashing  as a propaganda strategy to undercut communist claims that American POWs in Korean communist camps had voluntarily expressed sympathy for communism  He argued that the books of Edward Hunter  whom he identified as a secret CIA  psychological warfare specialist  passing as a journalist  pushed the CIA brainwashing theory onto the general public  Succumbing to their own propaganda  for twenty years starting in the early 1950s  the CIA and the Defense Department conducted secret research  notably including Project MKULTRA  in an attempt to develop practical brainwashing techniques  the results are unknown   2  New religious movements and the shift of focus  After the Korean War  applications of mind control theories in the United States shifted in focus from politics to religion  From the 1960s an increasing number of American youths started to come into contact with new religious movements  NRMs   and some who converted suddenly adopted beliefs and behaviors that differed greatly from those of their families and friends  in some cases they neglected or even broke contact with their loved ones   In the 1970s  the anti cult movement applied mind control theories to explain these sudden and seemingly dramatic religious conversions  The media was quick to follow suit  and social scientists sympathetic to the anti cult movement  who were usually psychologists  developed more sophisticated models of brainwashing  While some psychologists were receptive to these theories  sociologists were for the most part skeptical of their ability to explain conversion to NRMs   Margaret Singer  invented a new profession as a psychologist in the service  for several years almost full time  of anti cult lawsuits and initiatives   After the American Psychological Association rejected her theories  and her testimony was no longer allowed in court cases  she unsuccessfully sued the APA for  defamation  frauds  aiding and abetting and conspiracy    2 1  Theories of mind control and religious conversion  Over the years various theories of conversion and member retention have been proposed that link mind control to some new religious movements  NRMs   particularly those religious movements referred to as  cults  by their critics  These theories resemble the original political brainwashing theories with some minor changes  Philip Zimbardo discusses mind control as  the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception  motivation  affect  cognition and or behavioral outcomes   and he suggests that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation  In a 1999 book  Robert Lifton also applied his original ideas about thought reform to Aum Shinrikyo  concluding that in this context thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion  Margaret Singer  who also spent time studying the political brainwashing of Korean prisoners of war  agreed with this conclusion  in her book Cults in Our Midst she describes six conditions which would create an atmosphere in which thought reform is possible   According to Ted Patrick  the founder of FREECOG  later the Cult Awareness Network   brainwashing consisted of  hypnosis through brain waves projected from a cult recruiter’s eyes and fingertips   Based on this reasoning Patrick began developing a means of reversing cultic programming  which he termed deprogramming   Approaching the subject from the perspective of neuroscience and social psychology  Kathleen Taylor suggests that manipulation of the prefrontal cortex activates  brainwashing   rendering a person more susceptible to black and white thinking  Meanwhile  in Influence  Science and Practice  social psychologist Robert Cialdini argues that mind control is possible through the covert exploitation of the unconscious rules that underlie and facilitate healthy human social interactions  He states that common social rules can be used to prey upon the unwary  Using categories  he offers specific examples of both mild and extreme mind control—both one on one and in groups—notes the conditions under which each social rule is most easily exploited for false ends  and offers suggestions on how to resist such methods   Although most sociologists of religion consider the theories of brainwashing or mind control to be discredited  the anti cult movement still follows the  brainwashing thesis    2 2  Deprogramming and the anti cult movement  James Richardson observes that if the new religious movements  NRMs  had access to powerful brainwashing techniques  one would expect that NRMs would have high growth rates  yet in fact most have not had notable success in recruitment  Most adherents participate for only a short time  and the success in retaining members is limited  For this and other reasons  sociologists of religion including David Bromley and Anson Shupe consider the idea that  cults  are brainwashing American youth to be  implausible   In addition to Bromley  Thomas Robbins  Dick Anthony  Eileen Barker  Newton Maloney  Massimo Introvigne  John Hall  Lorne Dawson  Anson Shupe  Gordon Melton  Marc Galanter  and Saul Levine  amongst other scholars researching NRMs  have argued and established to the satisfaction of courts  relevant professional associations and scientific communities that there exists no generally accepted scientific theory  based upon methodologically sound research  that supports the brainwashing theories as advanced by the anti cult movement   The anti cult movement is not without its critics  Although some scholars accept that brainwashing exists  some sociologists who commonly refer to themselves as  sociologists of religion  assert that the anti cult movement uses brainwashing to its own financial gain  Perhaps notable among the sociologists of religion is Eileen Barker  who criticizes theories of conversion precisely because they function to justify costly interventions such as deprogramming or exit counseling  For similar reasons  Barker and other scholars have criticized mental health professionals like Margaret Singer for accepting lucrative expert witness jobs in court cases involving NRMs  Singer was perhaps the most publicly notable scholarly proponent of  cult  brainwashing theories  and she became the focal point of the relative demise of those same theories within her discipline   Other scholars disagree with this consensus amongst sociologists of religion  Benjamin Zablocki asserts that it s obvious that brainwashing occurs  at least to any objective observer  and that it isn t  a process that is directly observable   The  real sociological issue   Zabloki states  is whether  brainwashing occurs frequently enough to be considered an important social problem   Zablocki disagrees with scholars like Richardson  stating that Richardson s observation is flawed  According to Zablocki  Richardson misunderstands brainwashing  conceiving of it as a recruiting process  instead of a retaining process  So although Richardson s data are correct  Zablocki states  properly understood  brainwashing does not imply that NRMs will have a notable success in recruitment  so the criticism is inapt  Additionally  Zablocki attempts to debunk the other criticisms Richardson  et al   apply to brainwashing  if Zablocki is correct  there s a plethora of evidence in favor of the claim that some NRMs brainwash some of their members  Perhaps most notably  Zablocki says  the sheer number of former cult leaders and ex members who attest to brainwashing in interviews  performed in accordance with guidelines of the National Institute of Mental Health and National Science Foundation  is too large to be a result of anything other than a genuine phenomenon   Zablocki also reveals that of two most prestigious journals dedicated to the sociology of religion  the number of articles  supporting the brainwashing perspective  have been zero  while over one hundred such articles have been published in other journals  marginal to the field   From this fact  Zablocki concludes that the concept  brainwashing  has been  blacklisted  unfairly from the field of sociology of religion  Moreover  Zablocki claims that some prominent scholars who do not share his viewpoint have received  lavish funding  from NRMs  and that Barker and other sociologists of religion are frequently paid by cults to provide legal services on their behalf  These scholars tend to see no consensus  while what Melton sees as a majority of scholars regard it as a rejection of brainwashing and of mind control as legitimate theories   Sociologist David Bromley complained that in Zablocki’s formulation brainwashing remained a  vague  slippery  limiting  and ultimately untestable concept    2 3  Legal issues  the APA and DIMPAC  Since their inception  mind control theories have also been used in various legal proceedings against  cult  groups  In 1980  ex Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim successfully sued the Church of Scientology in a California court which decided in 1986 that church practices had been conducted in a psychologically coercive environment and so were not protected by religious freedom guarantees  Others who have tried claiming a  brainwashing defense  for crimes committed while purportedly under mind control  including Patty Hearst  Steven Fishman and Lee Boyd Malvo  have not been successful   In 1983  the American Psychological Association  APA  asked Margaret Singer to chair a taskforce called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control  DIMPAC  to investigate whether brainwashing or  coercive persuasion  did indeed play a role in recruitment by such movements  Before the taskforce had submitted its final report  the APA submitted on February 10  1987 an amicus curiæ brief in an ongoing court case related to brainwashing  Although the amicus curiæ brief written by the APA denies the credibility of the brainwashing theory  the APA submitted the brief under  intense pressure by a consortium of pro religion scholars  a k a  NRM scholars    The brief repudiated Singer s theories on  coercive persuasion  and suggested that brainwashing theories were without empirical proof  Afterward the APA filed a motion to withdraw its signature from the brief  since Singer s final report had not been completed   However  on May 11  1987  the APA s Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology  BSERP  rejected the DIMPAC report because the report  lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur   and concluded that  after much consideration  BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue   This leaves the APA s position on brainwashing as equivalent to  more research is needed until a definitive scientific verdict can be given   Two critical letters from external reviewers Benjamin Beit Hallahmi and Jeffery D  Fisher accompanied the rejection memo  The letters criticized  brainwashing  as an unrecognized theoretical concept and Singer s reasoning as so flawed that it was  almost ridiculous   After her findings were rejected  Singer sued the APA in 1992 for  defamation  frauds  aiding and abetting and conspiracy  and lost  Benjamin Zablocki and Alberto Amitrani interpreted the APA s response as meaning that there was no unanimous decision on the issue either way  suggesting also that Singer retained the respect of the psychological community after the incident  Yet her career as an expert witness ended at this time  She was meant to appear with Richard Ofshe in the 1990 U S  v  Fishman Case  in which Steven Fishman claimed to have been under mind control by the Church of Scientology in order to defend himself against charges of embezzlement  but the courts disallowed her testimony  In the eyes of the court   neither the APA nor the ASA has endorsed the views of Dr  Singer and Dr  Ofshe on thought reform    After that time U S  courts consistently rejected testimonies about mind control and manipulation  stating that such theories were not part of accepted mainline science according to the Frye Standard of 1923   3  Other areas  Mind control is a general term for a number of controversial theories proposing that an individual s thinking  behavior  emotions or decisions can  to a greater or lesser extent  be manipulated at will by outside sources  According to sociologist James T  Richardson  some of the concepts of brainwashing have spread to other fields and are applied  with some success  in contexts unrelated to the earlier cult controversies  such as custody battles and child sexual abuse cases   where one parent is accused of brainwashing the child to reject the other parent  and in child sex abuse cases where one parent is accused of brainwashing the child to make sex abuse accusations against the other parent   possibly resulting in or causing parental alienation     Plagio  is a term deriving from the Latin  plagium   In Italy there is still a controversy on this crime  consisting in an absolute psychological—and eventually physical domination of a person  The effect of such domination is the annihilation of the subject s freedom and self determination and the consequent negation of his or her personality  The crime of plagio has rarely been prosecuted in Italy  and only one person was ever convicted  In 1981  Italy the Court declared plagio unconstitutional and found the concept to be imprecise  lacking coherence  and liable to arbitrary application  A few years after  in the presence of Leonetto Amadei  the President of the High Court Corte  costituzionale della Repubblica Italiana   who cancelled the crime  in a scientific conference held in Forte dei Marmi in 1989 the new juridical situation was debated  According to a review of Michael Langone in the Cultic Studies Journal  IX 1 126 129  of International Cultic Studies Association  the conference  Socially Accepted Persuasion   Plagio  and Brainwashing  addressed the full range of phenomena associated with the continuum of psychological manipulation   Stephen A  Kent analyzes and summarizes the use of the brainwashing meme by non sociologists in the period 2000 2007  finding the term useful not only in the context of  New Religions Cults   but equally under the headings of  Teen Behavior Modification Programs  Terrorist Groups  Dysfunctional Corporate Culture  Interpersonal Violence  and Alleged Chinese Governmental Human Rights Violations Against Falun Gong    4  References  5  Further reading  Ellul  Jacques  Propaganda  The Formation of Men s Attitudes  Trans  Konrad Kellen & Jean Lerner  New York  Knopf  1965  New York  Random House
