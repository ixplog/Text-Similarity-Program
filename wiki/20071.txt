The Memory Data Register  MDR  is the register of a computer s control unit that contains the data to be stored in the computer storage  e g  RAM   or the data after a fetch from the computer storage  It acts like a buffer and holds anything that is copied from the memory ready for the processor to use it   The MDR is a two way register  When data is fetched from memory and placed into the MDR  it is written to in one direction  When there is a write instruction  the data to be written is placed into the MDR from another CPU register  which then puts the data into memory   The Memory Data Register is half of a minimal interface between a microprogram and computer storage  the other half is a memory address register  MAR    Far more complex memory interfaces exist  but this is the simplest that can work   The Memory Data Register  MDR  contains the data value being fetched or stored  We might be tempted to say that the MDR should be W bits wide  where W is the cell size  However on most computers the cell size is only 8 bits  and most data values occupy multiple cells  Thus the size of the MDR is usually a multiple of 8  Typical values of MDR width are 32 and 64 bits  which would allow us to fetch  in a single step  either an integer or a real value   For example  to retrieve the contents of cell 123  we would load the value 123  in binary  of course  into the MAR and perform a fetch operation  When the operation is done  a copy of the contents of cell 123 would be in the MDR  To store the value 98 into cell 4  we load a 4 into the MAR and a 98 into the MDR and perform a store  When the operation is completed the contents of cell 4 will have been set to 98  by discarding whatever was there previously   MDR has two inputs and two outputs  Data may be loaded into MDR either from the memory bus or from the internal processor bus The data stored in MDR may be placed on either bus
