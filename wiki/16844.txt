until 31 August 2012  Annan was the UN–Arab League Joint Special Representative for Syria  to help find a resolution to ongoing conflict there  Annan quit after becoming frustrated with the UN s lack of progress with regard to conflict resolution  stating that  when the Syrian people desperately need action  there continues to be finger pointing and name calling in the Security Council   He has been involved in several humanitarian projects and won several awards including the Kora All Africa Music Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001   1  Early years and education  Kofi Annan was born in the Kofandros section of Kumasi in the Gold Coast on 8 April 1938  His twin sister Efua Ataa  who died in 1991  shared the middle name Atta  which in the Akan means  twin   Annan and his sister were born into one of the country s Ashanti and Fante aristocratic families  both of their grandfathers and their uncle were tribal chiefs   In the Akan names tradition  some children are named according to the day of the week on which they were born  and or in relation to how many children precede them  Kofi in Akan is the name that corresponds with Friday  Annan has said his surname rhymes with  cannon  in English   From 1954 to 1957  Annan attended the elite Mfantsipim school  a Methodist boarding school in Cape Coast founded in the 1870s  Annan has said that the school taught him  that suffering anywhere concerns people everywhere   In 1957  the year Annan graduated from Mfantsipim  the Gold Coast gained independence from Britain and began using the name  Ghana    In 1958  Annan began studying economics at the Kumasi College of Science and Technology  now the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology of Ghana  He received a Ford Foundation grant  enabling him to complete his undergraduate studies in economics at Macalester College in St  Paul  Minnesota  United States  in 1961  Annan then completed a diplôme d études approfondies DEA degree in International Relations at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva  Switzerland  from 1961–62  After some years of work experience  he studied at the MIT Sloan School of Management  1971–72  in the Sloan Fellows program and earned a master s degree in management   Annan is fluent in English  French  Akan  some Kru languages and other African languages   2  Early career  In 1962  Kofi Annan started working as a Budget Officer for the World Health Organization  an agency of the United Nations  UN   From 1974 to 1976  he worked as the Director of Tourism in Ghana  In the late 1980s  Annan returned to work for the UN  where he was appointed as an Assistant Secretary General in three consecutive positions  Human Resources  Management and Security Coordinator  1987–1990   Program Planning  Budget and Finance  and Controller  1990–1992   and Peacekeeping Operations  March 1993 – December 1996    When Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali established the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in 1992  Annan was appointed to the new department as Deputy to then Under Secretary General Marrick Goulding  Annan was subsequently appointed to succeed Goulding and assumed the office of USG DPKO in March 1993  He was therefore Head of peacekeeping during the battle of Somalia and the resulting collapse of the UNOSOM II peacekeeping mission  and during the Rwandan Genocide of 1994   In 2003 Canadian ex General Roméo Dallaire  who was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda  claimed that Annan was overly passive in his response to the imminent genocide  In his book Shake Hands with the Devil  The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda  2003   General Dallaire asserted that Annan held back UN troops from intervening to settle the conflict  and from providing more logistical and material support  Dallaire claimed that Annan failed to provide responses to his repeated faxes asking for access to a weapons depository  such weapons could have helped Dallaire defend the endangered Tutsis  In 2004  ten years after the genocide in which an estimated 800 000 people were killed  Annan said   I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and rally support    In his book  Interventions  a life in War and Peace   Annan again argued that DPKO could have made better use of the media to raise awareness of the violence in Rwanda and put pressure on governments to provide the troops necessary for an intervention  Annan explained that the events in Somalia and the collapse of the UNOSOM II mission fostered a hesitation amongst UN Member states to approve robust peacekeeping operations  As a result  when the UNAMIR mission was approved just days after the battle  the resulting force lacked the troop levels  resources and mandate to operate effectively   Annan served as Under Secretary General from March 1994 to October 1995  He was appointed a Special Representative of the Secretary General to the former Yugoslavia  serving for five months before returning to his duties as Under Secretary General in April 1996   3  Secretary General of the United Nations  3 1  Appointment  On 13 December 1996  the United Nations Security Council recommended Annan to replace the previous Secretary General  Boutros Boutros Ghali of Egypt  whose second term faced the veto of the United States  Confirmed four days later by the vote of the General Assembly  he started his first term as Secretary General on 1 January 1997   3 2  Activities  3 2 1  Recommendations for UN reform  Soon after taking office in 1997  Annan released two reports on management reform  On 17 March 1997  the report ‘Management and Organisational Measures’  A 51 829  introduced new management mechanisms through the establishment of a cabinet style body to assist him and be grouping the UN’s activities in accordance with four core missions  A comprehensive reform agenda was issued on 14 July 1997 entitled ‘Renewing the United Nations  A Programme for Reform’  A 51 950   Key proposals included the introduction of strategic management to strengthen unity of purpose  the establishment of the position of Deputy Secretary General  a 10 percent reduction in posts  a reduction in administrative costs  the consolidation of the UN at the country level  and reaching out to civil society and the private sector as partners  Annan also proposed to hold a Millennium Summit in 2000  After years of research  Annan presented a progress report  In Larger Freedom  to the UN General Assembly  on 21 March 2005  Annan recommended Security Council expansion and a host of other UN reforms   On 31 January 2006  Kofi Annan outlined his vision for a comprehensive and extensive reform of the UN in a policy speech to the United Nations Association UK  The speech  delivered at Central Hall  Westminster  also marked the 60th Anniversary of the first meetings of the UN General Assembly and UN Security Council   On 7 March 2006  he presented to the General Assembly his proposals for a fundamental overhaul of the United Nations Secretariat  The reform report is entitled   Investing in the United Nations  For a Stronger Organization Worldwide    On 30 March 2006  he presented to the General Assembly his analysis and recommendations for updating the entire work programme of the United Nations Secretariat  The reform report is entitled   Mandating and Delivering  Analysis and Recommendations to Facilitate the Review of Mandates    Regarding the UN Human Rights Council  Annan has said  declining credibility  had  cast a shadow on the reputation of the United Nations system  Unless we re make our human rights machinery  we may be unable to renew public confidence in the United Nations itself   However  he does believe that  despite its flaws  the council can do good   In March 2000  Annan appointed the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations to assess the shortcomings of the then existing system and to make specific and realistic recommendations for change  The panel was composed of individuals experienced in conflict prevention  peacekeeping and peacebuilding  and became known as the  Brahimi Report   after Lakhdar Brahimi  Chair of the Panel  The report issued by the panel called for   1  renewed political commitment on the part of Member States  2  significant institutional change  3  increased financial support   The Panel further noted that in order to be effective  UN peacekeeping operations must be properly resourced and equipped  and operate under clear  credible and achievable mandates  In a letter transmitting the report to the General Assembly and Security Council  Annan stated that the Panel’s recommendations were  essential to make the United Nations truly credible as a force for peace   Later that same year  the United Nations Security Council adopted several provisions relating to peacekeeping following the report  in Resolution 1327   3 2 2  Millennium Development Goals  In 2000  ahead of the Millennium Summit  Annan issued a report entitled     The report argued that the significant geopolitical evolutions and increased globalization experienced over the previous 50 years required the United Nations to reassess and transform the way it operates  The report called for member states to  put people at the centre of everything we do  No calling is more noble  and no responsibility greater  than that of enabling men  women and children  in cities and villages around the world  to make their lives better    In the final chapter of the report  Annan drew on the findings of earlier work by the UN  The World Bank  the IMF and OECD  and identified priority areas on which the UN should focus in order to  free our fellow men and women from the abject and dehumanizing poverty in which more than 1 billion of them are currently confined  These served as the basis for the subsequent Millennium Development Goals  which were developed with additional input from the Millennium Forum  a group comprised 1 000 non governmental and civil society organizations from more than 100 countries    At the end of the Millenium Summit  delegates adopted the Millennium Declaration  in which they committed to a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and set out a series of time bound targets which subsequently become known as the Millennium Development Goals   3 2 3  The United Nations Global Compact  In an address to The World Economic Forum on 31 January 1999  then Secretary General Annan argued that the  goals of the United Nations and those of business can  indeed  be mutually supportive  and proposed that the private sector and the United Nations initiate  a global compact of shared values and principles  which will give a human face to the global market    On 26 July 2000  the United Nations Global Compact was officially launched at UN headquarters in New York  It is a principle based framework for businesses which aims to  Catalyse actions in support of broader UN goals  such as the Millennium Development Goals  MDGs    The Compact established ten core principles in the areas of human rights  labour  the environment and anti corruption  and under the Compact  companies commit to the ten principles and are brought together with UN agencies  labour groups and civil society to effectively implement them   3 2 4  Establishment of the Global Fund for Aids  Tuberculosis and Malaria   The Global Fund   Towards the end of the 1990s  increased awareness of the destructive potential of epidemics such as HIV AIDS pushed public health issues to the top of the global development agenda  In April 2001  Annan issued a five point  Call to Action  to address the HIV AIDS pandemic  Stating it was a  personal priority   Annan proposed the establishment of a Global AIDS and Health Fund   dedicated to the battle against HIV AIDS and other infectious diseases  to stimulate the increased international spending needed to help developing countries confront the HIV AIDS crisis  In June of that year  the General Assembly of the United Nations committed to the creation of such a fund during a special session on AIDS  and the permanent secretariat of the Global Fund was subsequently established in June 2002   3 2 5  Responsibility to Protect  Following the failure of the International Community to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda and in Srebrenica  Annan asked whether the international community had an obligation in such situations to intervene to protect civilian populations  In a speech to the General Assembly in September 1999  to address the prospects for human security and intervention in the next century   Annan argued that individual sovereignty  the protections afforded by the Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the UN  were being strengthened  while the notion of state sovereignty was being redefined by globalization and international cooperation  As a result  the UN and its Member States had to re consider their willingness to act to prevent conflict and civilian suffering   In September 2001 the Canadian government established an ad hoc committee to address this balance between State sovereignty and humanitarian intervention  The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty published its final report in 2001  which focused not on the right of states to intervene but on a responsibility to protect populations at risk  The report moved beyond the question of military intervention  arguing that a range of diplomatic and humanitarian actions could also be utilized to protect civilian populations   In 2005  Annan included the doctrine of ‘Responsibility to Protect’ in his report     www un org en events pastevents in larger freedom shtml In Larger Freedom    when that report was endorsed by the UN General Assembly  it amounted to the first formal endorsement by UN Member States of the doctrine of Responsibility to Protect   3 2 6  Iraq  In the years after 1998 when UNSCOM was kicked out by the government of Saddam Hussein and during the Iraq disarmament crisis  in which the United States blamed UNSCOM and former IAEA director Hans Blix for failing to properly disarm Iraq  Scott Ritter the former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector  blamed Annan for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive to the demands of the Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites  often Presidential palaces  that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value  which severely hampered UNSCOM s ability to cooperate with the Iraqi government and contributed to their expulsion from the country  Ritter also claimed that Annan regularly interfered with the work of the inspectors and diluted the chain of command by trying to micromanage all of the activities of UNSCOM  which caused intelligence processing  and the resulting inspections  to be backed up and caused confusion with the Iraqis as to who was in charge and as a result  they generally refused to take orders from Ritter or Rolf Ekéus without explicit approval from Annan  which could have taken days  if not weeks  He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections  He claimed that on one occasion  Annan refused to implement a no notice inspection of the SSO headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access  but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks  giving the Iraqis more than enough time to clean out the site   During the build up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq  Annan called on the United States and the United Kingdom not to invade without the support of the United Nations  In a September 2004 interview on the BBC  when questioned about the legal authority for the invasion  Annan said he believed it was not in conformity with the UN charter and was illegal   3 2 7  Other diplomatic activities  In 1998  Mr  Annan was deeply involved in supporting the transition from military to civilian rule in Nigeria  The following year  he supported the efforts of East Timor to secure independence from Indonesia  In 2000  he was responsible for certifying Israel  s withdrawal from Lebanon  and in 2006  he led talks in New York between the presidents of Cameroon and Nigeria which led to a settlement of the dispute between the two countries over the Bakassi peninsula   Annan and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad disagreed sharply on Iran s nuclear program  on an Iranian exhibition of cartoons mocking the Holocaust  and on the then upcoming International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust  an Iranian Holocaust denial conference in 2006  During a visit to Iran instigated by continued Iranian uranium enrichment  Annan said  I think the tragedy of the Holocaust is an undeniable historical fact and we should really accept that fact and teach people what happened in World War II and ensure it is never repeated    Annan supported sending a UN peacekeeping mission to Darfur  Sudan  He worked with the government of Sudan to accept a transfer of power from the African Union peacekeeping mission to a UN one  Annan also worked with several Arab and Muslim countries on women s rights and other topics   Beginning in 1998  Annan convened an annual UN  Security Council Retreat  with the 15 States  representatives of the Council  It was held at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund  RBF  Conference Center at the Rockefeller family estate at Pocantico  and was sponsored by both the RBF and the UN   3 2 8  Lubbers sexual harassment investigation  In June 2004  Annan was given a copy of the Office of Internal Oversight Services  OIOS  report on the complaint brought by four women workers against Ruud Lubbers  UN High Commissioner for Refugees for sexual harassment  abuse of authority  and retaliation  The report also reviewed a long serving staff member s allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Werner Blatter  Director of UNHCR Personnel  The investigation found Lubbers guilty of sexual harassment  no mention was made publicly of the other charge against a senior official  or two subsequent complaints filed later that year  In the course of the official investigation  Lubbers wrote a letter which some considered was a threat to the female worker who had brought the charges  On 15 July 2004  Annan cleared Lubbers of the accusations  saying they were not substantial enough legally  His decision held until November 2004  When the OIOS issued its annual report to the UN General Assembly  it stated that it had found Lubbers guilty of sexual harassment  These events were widely reported and weakened Annan s influence   On 17 November 2004  Annan accepted an OIOS report clearing Dileep Nair  UN Under Secretary General for Internal Oversight Services  of political corruption and sexual harassment charges  Some UN staff in New York disagreed with this conclusion  leading to extended debate on 19 November   The internal UN OIOS report on Lubbers was leaked  and sections accompanied by an article by Kate Holt were published in a British newspaper  In February 2005  he resigned as head of the UN refugee agency  Lubbers said he wanted to relieve political pressure on Annan   3 2 9  Oil for Food scandal  In December 2004  reports surfaced that the Secretary General s son Kojo Annan received payments from the Swiss company Cotecna Inspection SA  which had won a lucrative contract under the UN Oil for Food Program  Kofi Annan called for an investigation to look into the allegations   Annan appointed the Independent Inquiry Committee  which was led by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker  then the director of the United Nations Association of the US  In his first interview with the Inquiry Committee  Annan denied having had a meeting with Cotecna  Later in the inquiry  he recalled that he had met with Cotecna s chief executive Elie Georges Massey twice  In a final report issued on 27 October  the committee found insufficient evidence to indict Kofi Annan on any illegal actions  but did find fault with Benon Sevan  a Turkish Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years  Appointed by Annan to the Oil For Food role  Sevan repeatedly asked Iraqis for allocations of oil to the African Middle East Petroleum Company  Sevan s behavior was  ethically improper   Volcker said to reporters  Sevan repeatedly denied the charges and argued that he was being made a  scapegoat   The Volcker report was highly critical of the UN management structure and the Security Council oversight  It strongly recommended a new position be established of Chief Operating Officer  COO   to handle the fiscal and administrative responsibilities than under the Secretary General s office  The report listed the companies  both Western and Middle Eastern  that benefited illegally from the program   3 3  Nobel Peace Prize  In 2001  its centennial year  the Nobel Committee decided that the Peace Prize was to be divided between the United Nations  UN  and Kofi Annan  Annan was awarded the Peace Prize for having revitalized the UN and for having given priority to human rights  The Nobel Committee also recognized his commitment to the struggle to containing the spread of the HIV virus in Africa and his declared opposition to international terrorism   3 4  Relations between the United States and the United Nations  Kofi Annan supported his deputy Secretary General Mark Malloch Brown  who openly criticized the United States in a speech on 6 June 2006    T he prevailing practice of seeking to use the UN almost by stealth as a diplomatic tool while failing to stand up for it against its domestic critics is simply not sustainable  You will lose the UN one way or another         That  the US is constructively engaged with the UN       is not well known or understood  in part because much of the public discourse that reaches the US heartland has been largely abandoned to its loudest detractors such as Rush Limbaugh and Fox News   Malloch later said his talk was a  sincere and constructive critique of U S  policy toward the U N  by a friend and admirer    The talk was unusual because it violated unofficial policy of not having top officials publicly criticize member nations  The interim U S  ambassador John R  Bolton  appointed by President George W  Bush  was reported to have told Annan on the phone   I ve known you since 1989 and I m telling you this is the worst mistake by a senior UN official that I have seen in that entire time   Observers from other nations supported Malloch s view that conservative politicians in the US prevented many citizens from understanding the benefits of US involvement in the UN   3 5  UN Resolution 61 225  World Diabetes Day  Kofi Annan witnessed the United Nations General Assembly s passage of UN Resolution 61 225  to establish World Diabetes Day  The Resolution was the second UN General Assembly Resolution on a health related issue  the other being HIV AIDS   Resolution 61 225 is the only Health related UN Resolution to pass by consensus  Sponsored by the Republic of South Africa and Bangladesh  the Resolution was passed on 20 December 2006   3 6  UN Resolution 60 7  International Holocaust Remebrance day  Mr  Annan also witnessed the establishment of International Holocaust Remembrance Day  designated by the UN General Assembly on 1 November 2005 during the 42nd plenary session  The Resolution urges every member nation of the U N  to honor the memory of Holocaust victims  and encourages the development of educational programs about Holocaust history to help prevent future acts of genocide  It rejects any denial of the Holocaust as an event and condemns all manifestations of religious intolerance  incitement  harassment or violence against persons or communities based on ethnic origin or religious belief  International Holocaust Remembrance day is celebrated on 27 January  the day Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz Birkenau the largest Nazi camp   3 7  Farewell addresses  On 19 September 2006  Annan gave a farewell address to world leaders gathered at the UN headquarters in New York  in anticipation of his retirement on 31 December  In the speech he outlined three major problems of  an unjust world economy  world disorder  and widespread contempt for human rights and the rule of law   which he believes  have not resolved  but sharpened  during his time as Secretary General  He also pointed to violence in Africa  and the Arab Israeli conflict as two major issues warranting attention   On 11 December 2006  in his final speech as Secretary General  delivered at the Harry S  Truman Presidential Library in Independence  Missouri  Annan recalled Truman s leadership in the founding of the United Nations  He called for the United States to return to President Truman s multilateralist foreign policies  and to follow Truman s credo that  the responsibility of the great states is to serve and not dominate the peoples of the world   He also said that the United States must maintain its commitment to human rights   including in the struggle against terrorism    4  Post UN career  Following his two terms as Secretary General  Annan was immediately suggested as a candidate to become the country s next President   4 1  Kofi Annan Foundation  In 2007 he established the   an independent  not for profit organization which works to promote better global governance and strengthen the capacities of people and countries to achieve a fairer  more secure world  The Foundation has developed programmes and partnerships in three main focus areas   i  Peace and Security   ii  Sustainable Development  and  iii  Human Rights and the Rule of Law   4 2  KNDR  Following the outbreak of violence during the 2007 Presidential elections in Kenya  the African Union established a Panel of Eminent African Personalities to assist in finding a peaceful solution to the crisis   The panel  headed by Annan  managed to convince the two principal parties to the conflict  President Mwai Kibaki’s Party of National Unity  PNU  and Raila Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement  ODM   to participate in the Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation Process  KNDR   Over the course of 41 days of negotiations  several agreements regarding taking actions to stop the violence and remedying its consequences were signed  On 28 February President Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga signed a coalition government agreement  Kofi Annan and was widely lauded by many Kenyans for this landmark achievement   4 3  Joint Special Envoy for Syria  On 23 February 2012  Annan was

ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists and a non discriminatory visa policy for them   respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully as legally guaranteed  On 2 August  he resigned as U N  and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria  citing the intransigence of both the Assad government and the rebels  as well as the stalemate on the Security Council as preventing any peaceful resolution of the situation  He also stated that the lack of international unity and ineffective diplomacy among the world leaders has made the peaceful resolution in Syria an impossible task   4 3 1  Global Commission on Elections  Democracy and Security  Annan served as the Chair of the   The Commission was launched in May 2011 as a joint initiative
