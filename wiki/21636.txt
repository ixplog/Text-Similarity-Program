in English literature  From 1985 to 1987  she was a Rhodes Scholar at New College  Oxford   In 2004  Wolf reported an alleged incident of  sexual encroachment  by professor Harold Bloom she had experienced when she was a Yale undergraduate working on poetry with Bloom  Frustrated in her efforts to gain satisfaction that the university would take such an incident seriously  Wolf made her complaint public   Wolf was married to journalist David Shipley  They have two children  Rosa  b  1995  and Joseph  b  2000   Wolf and Shipley divorced in 2005   2  Works  2 1  The Beauty Myth  In the early 1990s  Wolf gained international fame as a spokeswoman of third wave feminism as a result of the success of her first book The Beauty Myth  which became an international bestseller  In the book  she argues that  beauty  as a normative value is entirely socially constructed  and that the patriarchy determines the content of that construction with the goal of reproducing its own hegemony   Wolf posits the idea of an  iron maiden   an intrinsically unattainable standard that is then used to punish women physically and psychologically for their failure to achieve and conform to it  Wolf criticized the fashion and beauty industries as exploitative of women  but added that the beauty myth extended into all areas of human functioning  Wolf writes that women should have  the choice to do whatever we want with our faces and bodies without being punished by an ideology that is using attitudes  economic pressure  and even legal judgments regarding women s appearance to undermine us psychologically and politically   Wolf argues that women were under assault by the  beauty myth  in five areas  work  religion  sex  violence  and hunger  Ultimately  Wolf argues for a relaxation of normative standards of beauty  In her introduction  Wolf positioned her argument against the concerns of second wave feminists and offered the following analysis   Wolf s book was a bestseller  receiving polarized responses from the public and mainstream media  but winning praise from most feminists  Second wave feminist Germaine Greer wrote that The Beauty Myth was  the most important feminist publication since The Female Eunuch  and Gloria Steinem wrote   The Beauty Myth is a smart  angry  insightful book  and a clarion call to freedom  Every woman should read it   British novelist Fay Weldon called the book  essential reading for the New Woman   Betty Friedan wrote in Allure magazine that   The Beauty Myth  and the controversy it is eliciting could be a hopeful sign of a new surge of feminist consciousness    However  Camille Paglia  whose Sexual Personae was published the same year as The Beauty Myth  derided Wolf as unable to perform  historical analysis   and called her education  completely removed from reality   Her comments touched off a series of contentious debates between Wolf and Paglia in the pages of The New Republic   Likewise  Christina Hoff Sommers criticized Wolf for publishing the estimate that 150 000 women were dying every year from anorexia  Sommers wrote that the actual number is closer to 100  a figure which others  such as Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards  stated to be much too low  In the same interview  Sommers stated that Wolf had retracted the figure   The New York Times published a harshly critical assessment of Wolf s work by Caryn James  She lambasted the book as a  sloppily researched polemic as dismissible as a hackneyed adventure film   Even by the standards of pop cultural feminist studies  The Beauty Myth is a mess   In a comparatively positive review  The Washington Post called the book  persuasive  and praised its  accumulated evidence    2 2  Promiscuities  Promiscuities reports on and analyzes the shifting patterns of contemporary adolescent sexuality  Wolf argues that literature is rife with examples of male coming of age stories  covered autobiographically by D  H  Lawrence  Tobias Wolff  J  D  Salinger  and Ernest Hemingway  and covered misogynistically by Henry Miller  Philip Roth  and Norman Mailer  Wolf insists  however  that female accounts of adolescent sexuality have been systematically suppressed  She adduces cross cultural material to demonstrate that women have  across history  been celebrated as more carnal than men  Wolf also argues that women must reclaim the legitimacy of their own sexuality by shattering the polarization of women between virgin and whore   Promiscuities received  in general  negative reviews  The New York Times published a review that characterized Wolf as a  frustratingly inept messenger  a sloppy thinker and incompetent writer  She tries in vain to pass off tired observations as radical aperçus  subjective musings as generational truths  sappy suggestions as useful ideas   Two days earlier  however  a different Times reviewer praised the book  writing   Anyone—particularly anyone who  like Ms  Wolf  was born in the 1960s—will have a very hard time putting down Promiscuities  Told through a series of confessions  her book is a searing and thoroughly fascinating exploration of the complex wildlife of female sexuality and desire   In contrast  The Library Journal excoriated the work  writing   Overgeneralization abounds as she attempts to apply the microcosmic events of this mostly white  middle class  liberal milieu to a whole generation    There is a desperate defensiveness in the tone of this book which diminishes the force of her argument    2 3  Misconceptions  Misconceptions examines modern assumptions surrounding pregnancy and childbirth  Most of the book is told through the prism of Wolf s personal experience of her first pregnancy  She describes the  vacuous impassivity  of the ultrasound technician who gives her the first glimpse of her new baby  Wolf both laments her C section and examines why the procedure is commonplace in the United States  and advocates a return to more personal approaches to childbirth such as midwifery  The second half of the book catalogs a series of anecdotes about life after giving birth  focusing in particular on inequalities that arise in men and women s approaches and adjustments to child care   2 4  The End of America  In The End of America  Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot  Wolf takes a historical look at the rise of fascism  outlining 10 steps necessary for a fascist group  or government  to destroy the democratic character of a nation state and subvert the social political liberty previously exercised by its citizens   Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy  Create secret prisons where torture takes place  Develop a thug caste or paramilitary force not answerable to citizens  Set up an internal surveillance system  Harass citizens  groups  Engage in arbitrary detention and release  Target key individuals  Control the press  Treat all political dissidents as traitors  Suspend the rule of law The book details how this pattern was implemented in Nazi Germany  Fascist Italy  and elsewhere  and analyzes its emergence and application of all the 10 steps in American political affairs since the September 11 attacks   The End of America was adapted for the screen as a documentary by filmmakers Annie Sundberg and Ricki Stern  best known for The Devil Came on Horseback and The Trials of Darryl Hunt  It had its worldwide premiere at the Hamptons International Film Festival on October 17  2008  It has since been screened at Sheffield DocFest in the UK  as well as in limited release at New York City s IFC Center  The film became available online on October 21  2008 at SnagFilms  End of America was favorably reviewed in The New York Times by Stephen Holden as well as in Variety magazine   Mark Nuckols of the Russian Academy of National Economy argues in The Atlantic that Wolf draws false historical parallels based on highly selective and misleading citations   2 5  Give Me Liberty  Give Me Liberty  A Handbook for American Revolutionaries was written as a sequel to The End of America  Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot   In the book  Wolf looks at times and places in history where citizens were faced with the closing of an open society and successfully fought back  and looks back at the ordinary people of the Founding Fathers of the United States  generation  the ones not named by history  all of whom had this  vision of liberty  and moved it forward by putting their lives on the line to make the vision real  She is an outspoken advocate for citizenship and wonders whether younger Americans have the skills and commitment to act as true citizens  She wrote in 2007   2 6  Vagina  A New Biography  Published in 2012 on the topic of the vagina  Vagina  A New Biography was widely criticized  especially by feminist authors  Calling it  ludicrous  at Slate com  Katie Roiphe wrote   I doubt the most brilliant novelist in the world could have created a more skewering satire of Naomi Wolf’s career than her latest book   In The Nation  Katha Pollitt said the book was  silly  and contained  much dubious neuroscience and much foolishness   she concluded   It’s lucky vaginas can’t read  or mine would be cringing in embarrassment   Although writing that  Wolf’s ideas and suggestions in  Vagina  are valuable ones   Toni Bentley said in The New York Times Book Review that the book contained  shoddy  research and  is undermined by the fact that she has rendered herself less than unreliable over the past couple of decades  with one rant more hysterical than another   Los Angeles Times columnist Meghan Daum decried the book’s  painful  writing and its  hoary ideas about how women think   In The New York Observer  Nina Burleigh suggested that critics of the book were so vehement  because  a  their editors handed the book to them for review because they thought it was an Important Feminist Book when it s actually slight and  b  there’s a grain of truth in what she’s trying to say    In response to the criticism  Wolf stated the following in a television interview      anything that shows documentation of the brain and vagina connection is going to alarm some feminists       also feminism has kind of retreated into the academy and sort of embraced the idea that all gender is socially constructed and so here is a book that is actually looking at science        though there has been some criticisms of the book from some feminists     who say  well you can’t look at the science because that means we have to grapple with the science        to me the feminist task of creating a just world isn’t changed at all by this fascinating neuroscience that shows some differences between men and women   2 7  Other writings  Wolf s other books include Fire with Fire on politics  female empowerment and women s sexual liberation  The New York Times assailed the work for its  dubious oversimplifications and highly debatable assertions  and its  disconcerting penchant for inflationary prose   nonetheless noting Wolf s  efforts to articulate an accessible  pragmatic feminism     helping to replace strident dogma with common sense   The Time magazine reviewer dismissed the book as  flawed   noting however that Wolf was  an engaging raconteur  who was also  savvy about the role of TV – especially the Thomas Hill hearings and daytime talk shows – in radicalizing women  including homemakers   The reviewer characterized the book as advocating an inclusive strain of feminism that welcomed abortion opponents   In 2005  Wolf published The Treehouse  Eccentric Wisdom from my Father on How to Live  Love  and See  which chronicled her midlife crisis attempt to reclaim her creative and poetic vision and revalue her father s love  and her father s force as an artist and a teacher   3  Feminist positions   Abortion In publishing an article in The New Republic that criticized contemporary pro choice positions  Wolf argued that the movement had  developed a lexicon of dehumanization  and urged feminists to accept abortion as a form of homicide and defend the procedure within the ambiguity of this moral conundrum  She continues   Abortion should be legal  it is sometimes even necessary  Sometimes the mother must be able to decide that the fetus  in its full humanity  must die    Wolf concluded by speculating that in a world of  real gender equality   passionate feminists  might well hold candlelight vigils at abortion clinics  standing shoulder to shoulder with the doctors who work there  commemorating and saying goodbye to the dead   More recently  in an article on the subtle manipulation of George W  Bush s image among women  Wolf wrote  Abortion is an issue not of Ms  Magazine style fanaticism or suicidal Republican religious reaction  but a complex issue    Pro life commentators said Wolf  fails to carry through fully in her analysis   this simply is not  or should not be  the unqualified response of our society to the destruction of innocent life     Pornography Wolf suggested in 2003 that the ubiquity of internet pornography tends to enervate the sexual attraction of men toward typical real women  She writes   The onslaught of porn is responsible for deadening male libido in relation to real women  and leading men to see fewer and fewer women as  porn worthy   Far from having to fend off porn crazed young men  young women are worrying that as mere flesh and blood  they can scarcely get  let alone hold  their attention   Wolf advocates abstaining from porn not on moral grounds  but because  greater supply of the stimulant equals diminished capacity     Women in Fascism Wolf has examined how modern Western women  born in inclusive  egalitarian liberal democracies  are assuming positions of leadership in neofascist political movements    Women in Islamic countries Wolf has spoken about the dress required of women living in Muslim countries    Defense of Julian Assange The December 20  2010 airing of Democracy Now  featured a segment titled  Naomi Wolf vs  Jaclyn Friedman  Feminists Debate the Sexual Allegations Against Julian Assange  in which Jaclyn Friedman argues the sexual assault allegations against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange shouldn t be dismissed just because they may be politically motivated  Wolf argues that the alleged victims should have said no  that they consented to having sex with Assange  that the charges are politically motivated and demean the cause of legitimate rape victims  The discussion took place shortly after the leaking of the Swedish police report on the incident   4  Alleged sexual encroachment incident at Yale  In 2004  a year before her divorce  Wolf wrote an article for New York magazine accusing literary scholar Harold Bloom of a  sexual encroachment  more than two decades earlier by touching her thigh  She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment  either legally or emotionally  and she did not think herself a  victim   but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years  Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges  Wolf wrote   I began  nearly a year ago  to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren t still occurring  I expected Yale to be responsive  After nine months and many calls and e mails  I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge    Reflecting on Yale University s sexual harassment guidelines  Wolf wrote   Sexual encroachment in an educational context or a workplace is  most seriously  a corruption of meritocracy  it is in this sense parallel to bribery  I was not traumatized personally  but my educational experience was corrupted  If we rephrase sexual transgression in school and work as a civil rights and civil society issue  everything becomes less emotional  less personal  If we see this as a systemic corruption issue  then when people bring allegations  the focus will be on whether the institution has been damaged in its larger mission    A formal complaint was filed with the U S  Department of Education Office for Civil Rights on March 15  2011  by 16 current and former Yale students—12 female and 4 male—describing a sexually hostile environment at Yale  A federal investigation of Yale University began in March 2011 in response to the complaints   Wolf said on CBS s The Early Show   Yale has been systematically covering up much more serious crimes than the ones that can be easily identified  What they do is that they use the sexual harassment grievance procedure in a very cynical way  purporting to be supporting victims  but actually using a process to stonewall victims  to isolate them  and to protect the university    as quoted in the Daily Mail  Yale settled the Federal complaint in June 2012  acknowledging  inadequacies  but not  facing disciplinary action with the understanding that it keeps in place policy changes instituted after the complaint was filed  The school must report on its progress to the Office of Civil Rights until May 2014    5  Political consultant  Wolf was involved in Bill Clinton s 1996 re election bid  brainstorming with the president s team about ways to reach female voters  During Al Gore s unsuccessful bid for the presidency in the 2000 election  Wolf was hired as a consultant to target female voters  reprising her role in the Clinton campaign  Wolf s ideas and participation in the Gore campaign generated considerable media coverage and criticism  According to a report by Michael Duffy in Time  Wolf was paid a monthly salary of $15 000  in exchange for advice on everything from how to win the women s vote to shirt and tie combinations   This article was the original source of the widely reported assertion that Wolf was responsible for Gore s  three buttoned  earth toned look    In an interview with Melinda Henneberger in The New York Times  Wolf denied ever advising Gore on his wardrobe  Wolf herself said she mentioned the term  alpha male  only once in passing and that   it  was just a truism  something the pundits had been saying for months  that the vice president is in a supportive role and the President is in an initiatory role    I used those terms as shorthand in talking about the difference in their job descriptions    6  Occupy Wall Street  On October 18  2011  Wolf was arrested in New York during the Occupy Wall Street protests  and spent about half an hour in a cell  Speaking about her arrest  Wolf said   I was taken into custody for disobeying an unlawful order  The issue is that I actually know New York City permit law     I didn’t choose to get myself arrested  I chose to obey the law and that didn’t protect me    A month later  Wolf wrote an article that argued that attacks on the Occupy movement were a coordinated plot  orchestrated by federal law enforcement agencies and implemented by American mayors  She alleged that  congressional overseers  with the blessing of the White House  told the DHS to authorise mayors to order their police forces—pumped up with millions of dollars of hardware and training from the DHS—to make war on peaceful citizens   The response to this article ranged from praise to criticism of Wolf for being overly speculative and creating a  conspiracy theory   Wolf responded that there is ample evidence for her argument  and proceeded to review the information available to her at the time of the article  and new evidence since that time   In early 2012  WikiLeaks began publishing the Global Intelligence Files  a trove of e mails obtained via a hack by Anonymous and Jeremy Hammond  Among them was an email with an official Department of Homeland Security It indicated that DHS was closely watching Occupy  and concluded   While the peaceful nature of the protests has served so far to mitigate their impact  larger numbers and support from groups such as Anonymous substantially increase the risk for potential incidents and enhance the potential security risk to critical infrastructure   In late December 2012  FBI documents released following an FOIA request from the Partnership for Civil Justice revealed that the FBI used counterterrorism agents and other resources to extensively monitor the national Occupy movement  The documents contained no references to agency personnel covertly infiltrating Occupy branches  but did indicate that the FBI gathered information from police departments and other law enforcement agencies relating to planned protests  Additionally  the blog Techdirt reported that the documents disclosed a plot by unnamed parties  to murder OWS leadership in Texas  but that  the FBI never bothered to inform the targets of the threats against their lives    According to Mother Jones  none of the documents revealed efforts by federal law enforcement to disband the Occupy camps or provided much evidence that federal officials attempted to suppress protesters  free speech rights  It was  said Mother Jones   a far cry from Wolf s contention  in a December 2012 piece for The Guardian   7  Controversies over alleged conspiracy theories  7 1  2013  Writing in The Atlantic in January 2013  law and business professor Mark Nuckols declared   In her various books  articles  and public speeches  Wolf has demonstrated recurring disregard for the historical record and consistently mutilated the truth with selective and ultimately deceptive use of her sources  All of this might have little real world import when she writes about her orgasms or her weight problems  But when she distorts facts to advance her political agenda  she dishonors the victims of history and poisons present day public discourse about issues of vital importance to a free society   In particular  Nuckols argued   Naomi Wolf has for many years now been claiming that a fascist coup in America is imminent  Most recently in The Guardian she alleged  with no substantiation  that the U S  government and big American banks are conspiring to impose a  totally integrated corporate state repression of dissent     In June 2013  New York magazine reported that in a recent Facebook post  Wolf had expressed her  creeping concern  that NSA leaker Edward Snowden  is not who he purports to be  and that the motivations involved in the story may be more complex than they appear to be   Wolf was similarly skeptical of Snowden s  very pretty pole dancing Facebooking girlfriend who appeared for  well  no reason in the media coverage … and who keeps leaking commentary  so her picture can be recycled in the press   Wolf responded at her website   I do find a great deal of media blog discussion about serious questions such as those I raised  questions that relate to querying some sources of news stories  and their potential relationship to intelligence agencies or to other agendas that may not coincide with the overt narrative  to be extraordinarily ill informed and naive   Specifically regarding Snowden  she wrote   Why should it be seen as bizarre to wonder  if there are some potential red flags—the key term is  wonder —if a former NSA spy turned apparent whistleblower might possibly still be—working for the same people he was working for before    7 2  2014  In October 2014  Wolf again aroused controversy  with a series of Facebook posts questioning the authenticity of videos that purported to show beheadings of two Americans and two Britons by the Islamic State  implying that they had been staged by the U S  government and that the victims and their parents were actors  Wolf also charged that the U S  was dispatching troops not to assist in treating the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa but to carry the disease back home to justify a military takeover of America  She further said that the Scottish independence referendum  in which Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom  was faked  Speaking about this at a demonstration in Glasgow on October 12  Wolf said   I truly believe it was rigged   Vox journalist Max Fisher urged Wolf s readers  to understand the distinction between her earlier work  which rose on its merits  and her newer conspiracy theories  which are unhinged  damaging  and dangerous   Charles C  W  Cooke observed at the National Review Online   Over the last eight years  Naomi Wolf has written hysterically about coups and about vaginas and about little else besides  She has repeatedly insisted that the country is on the verge of martial law  and transmogrified every threat—both pronounced and overhyped—into a government led plot to establish a dictatorship  She has made prediction after prediction that has simply not come to pass  Hers are not sober and sensible forecasts of runaway human nature  institutional atrophy  and constitutional decline  but psychedelic fever dreams that are more typically suited to the InfoWars crowd   Under the headline  Naomi Wolf Went Off the Deep End Long Ago   The American Spectator advised   Her words must be taken not just with a grain of salt  but a full shaker s worth    Responding to such criticism  Wolf said   All the people who are attacking me right now for  conspiracy theories  have no idea what they are talking about … people who assume the dominant narrative MUST BE TRUE and the dominant reasons MUST BE REAL are not experienced in how that world works   To her nearly 100 000 Facebook followers  Wolf maintained   I stand by what I wrote   However  in a follow up Facebook post two days later  Wolf back pedaled   I am not asserting that the ISIS videos have been staged   she wrote   I certainly sincerely apologize if one of my posts was insensitively worded  I have taken that one down  … I am not saying the ISIS beheading videos are not authentic  I am not saying they are not records of terrible atrocities  I am saying that they are not yet independently confirmed by two sources as authentic  which any Journalism School teaches  and the single source for several of them  SITE  which received half a million dollars in government funding in 2004  and which is the only source cited for several  has conflicts of interest that should be disclosed to readers of news outlets    8  Selected bibliography   Books  The Beauty Myth  How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women  1990  ISBN 978 0 06 051218 7   Fire with Fire  1994
