Paulinus of Nola  also known as Paolino di Nola  full name  Pontius Meropius Anicius Paulinus   ca  354 Bordeaux – 22 June 431 Nola  was a Latin poet and letter writer  and a convert to the Christian faith  His renunciation of wealth and a senatorial career in favour of a Christian ascetic and philanthropic life was held up as an example by many of his contemporaries  including Augustine  Jerome  Martin of Tours  and Ambrose  After his conversion he wrote to his friend and teacher  the poet Ausonius  affirming his friendship but insisting on the priorities of his new life  He and his wife settled at Nola near Naples  where he wrote poems in honor of St  Felix and corresponded with Christian leaders throughout the Roman Empire  After his wife s death he became Bishop of Nola  and was invited to help resolve the disputed election of Pope Boniface I   He was recognized as a saint in the undivided Church and is commemorated on 22 June   1  Life  Pontius Meropius Paulinus was born ca  352 at Bordeaux  in southwestern France  He was from a notable senatorial family with estates in the Aquitaine province of France  northern Spain  and southern Italy  He was educated in Bordeaux  where his teacher  the poet Ausonius  also became his friend  At some time during his boyhood he made a visit to the shrine of St Felix at Nola near Naples   His normal career as a young member of the senatorial class did not last long  In 375 the Emperor Gratian succeeded his father Valentinian  Gratian made Paulinus suffect consul at Rome ca  377  and appointed him governor of the southern Italian province of Campania ca  380 1  but in 383 Gratian was assassinated at Lyon  France  and ca  384 Paulinus returned to Bordeaux  There he married a Spanish Christian woman named Therasia  Paulinus himself became a Christian and was baptized ca  389 by Bishop Delphinus of Bordeaux  Shortly afterwards  his wife and he moved to their estates in Spain  When they lost their first child  a boy  only eight days after birth  the couple decided to live a secluded religious life   In 393 or 394  after some resistance from Paulinus  he was ordained a presbyter on Christmas day by Lampius  Bishop of Barcelona   This was similar to what had happened with St  Augustine of Hippo  who had been ordained against his protestations in the year 391 at the behest of a crowd cooperating with Bishop Valerius in the north African city of Hippo Regius   However  there is some debate as to whether the ordination was canonical  since Paulinus received ordination  at a leap   per saltum   without receiving minor orders first   Paulinus refused to remain in Barcelona  and in late spring of 395 he and his wife moved from Spain to Nola in Campania where he remained until his death  Paulinus credited his conversion to St  Felix  who was buried in Nola  and each year would write a poem in honor of the saint  He and Therasia also rebuilt a church commemorating St  Felix  During these years Paulinus engaged in considerable epistolary dialogue with St  Jerome among others about monastic topics   Therasia died some time between 408 and 413  and shortly afterwards Paulinus received episcopal ordination   Paulinus died at Nola on 22 June 431  The following year the presbyter Uranus wrote his De Obitu Paulini  an account of the death and character of the saint   1 1  Influence  Already during his governorship Paulinus had developed a fondness for the 3rd century martyr  St  Felix of Nola  Felix was a minor saint of local importance and patronage whose tomb had been built within the local necropolis at Cimitile  just outside the town of Nola  As governor  Paulinus had widened the road to Cimitile and built a residence for travelers  it was at this site that Paulinus and Therasia took up residence  Nearby were a number of small chapels and at least one old basilica  Paulinus rebuilt the complex  constructing a brand new basilica to Felix and gathering to him a small monastic community  Paulinus wrote an annual hymn  natalicium  in honor of St  Felix for the feast day when processions of pilgrims were at their peak  In these hymns we can understand the personal relationship Paulinus felt between himself and Felix  his advocate in heaven  His poetry shares with much of the work of the early 5th century an ornateness of style that classicists of the 18th and 19th centuries found cloying and dismissed as decadent  though Paulinus  poems were highly regarded at the time and used as educational models   Many of Paulinus s letters to his contemporaries  including Ausonius and Sulpicius Severus in southern Gaul  Victricius of Rouen in northern Gaul  and Augustine in Africa  are preserved   Paulinus may have been indirectly responsible for Augustine s Confessions  Paulinus wrote to Alypius  Bishop of Thagaste and a close friend of St  Augustine  asking about his conversion and taking up of the ascetic life  Alypius s autobiographical response does not survive  St  Augustine s ostensible answer to that query is the  Confessions    Around 410 Paulinus was chosen Bishop of Nola  Like a growing number of aristocrats in the late 4th and early 5th centuries who were entering the clergy rather than taking up the more usual administrative careers in the imperial service  Paulinus spent a great deal of his money on his chosen church and city   We know about his buildings in honor of St  Felix from literary and archaeological evidence  especially from his long letter to Sulpicius Severus describing the arrangement of the building and its decoration  He includes a detailed description of the apse mosaic over the main altar and gives the text for a long inscription he had written to be put on the wall under the image  By explaining how he intended the visitors to understand the image over the altar  Paulinus provided rare insight into the intentions of a patron of art in the later Empire   In later life Paulinus  by then a highly respected church authority  participated in multiple church synods investigating various ecclesiastical controversies of the time  including Pelagianism   2  Relics  About 800 Prince Grimoald III of Benevento removed Paulinus s bones as relics   From the 11th century they rested at the church of Saint Adalbert  now Saint Bartholomew  on the island in the Tiber in Rome  In 1908 Pope Pius X permitted them to be translated to the new cathedral at Nola  where they were reinterred on 15 May 1909   The bones are now found in the small Sicilian city of Sutera  where they dedicate a feast day  and conduct a procession for the saint at Easter each year   3  Modern devotion to St  Paulinus  The people of modern day Nola and the surrounding regions remain devoted to St  Paulinus  His feast day is celebrated annually in Nola during  La Festa dei Gigli   the Feast of the Lilies   in which Gigli and several large statues in honor of the saint  placed on towers  are carried upon the shoulders of the faithful around the city   In the United States the descendants of Italian immigrants from Nola and Brusciano continue the tradition in Brooklyn and as well as in Manhattan s East Harlem neighborhood  where beginning in the early 1900s  the Giglio Society of East Harlem holds its annual dancing of the Giglio on Pleasant Avenue on the second Sunday in August   4
