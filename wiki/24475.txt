Polygamy  from Late Greek   polygamia   state of marriage to many spouses  or  frequent marriage   is a marriage that includes more than two partners  When a man is married to more than one wife at a time  the relationship is called polygyny  and when a woman is married to more than one husband at a time  it is called polyandry  If a marriage includes multiple husbands and wives  it can be called group or conjoint marriage  The term is used in related ways in social anthropology  sociology  as well as in popular speech  In contrast  monogamy is a marriage consisting of only two parties  Like monogamy  the term polygamy is often used in a de facto sense  applied regardless of whether the relationship is recognized by the state  see marriage for a discussion on the extent to which states can and do recognize potentially and actually polygamous forms as valid   In sociobiology and zoology  polygamy is used in a broad sense to mean any form of multiple mating   In countries that do not permit polygamy  a person who marries a second person while still being lawfully married is committing the crime of bigamy   In the global context  acceptance of polygamy is common  According to the Ethnographic Atlas  of 1 231 societies noted  186 were monogamous  453 had occasional polygyny  588 had more frequent polygyny  and 4 had polyandry  At the same time  even within societies that allow polygyny  the actual practice of polygyny occurs unevenly  There are exceptions  in Senegal  for example  nearly 47 percent of marriages are multiple  Within polygynous societies  multiple wives often become a status symbol denoting wealth  power  and fame  Polyandry is less rare than the figure commonly cited in the Ethnographic Atlas  1980   which listed only those examples found in the Himalayan Mountains  More recent studies have found 53 societies outside of the 28 found in the Himalayas  which practice polyandry   Zeitzen states that Western perceptions of African society and marriage patterns are biased by  contradictory concerns of nostalgia for traditional African culture versus critique of polygamy as oppressive to women or detrimental to development   Many international human rights organisations as well as women s rights groups in many countries have called for its abolition  The practice has been ruled to violate the ICCPR  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights   and the United Nations has recommended that the practice be abolished   1  Forms of polygamy  Polygamy exists in three specific forms  polygyny   wherein a man has multiple simultaneous wives  polyandry   wherein a woman has multiple simultaneous husbands  or group marriage   wherein the family unit consists of multiple husbands and multiple wives  Anthropologists treat serial monogamy  in which divorce and remarriage occur  as a form of polygamy as it also establishes a series of households that continue to be tied by shared paternity and shared income  Ambiguity may arise when the broad term  polygamy  is used with reference to a specific form of polygamy  Additionally  different countries may or may not include all forms in their laws on polygamy   1 1  Polygyny  1 1 1  Incidence  Anthropologist Jack Goody s comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas demonstrated an historical correlation between the practice of extensive shifting horticulture and polygamy in the majority of Sub Saharan African societies  Drawing on the work of Ester Boserup  Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies between the male dominated intensive plough agriculture common in Eurasia and the extensive shifting horticulture found in sub Saharan Africa  In some of the sparsely populated regions where shifting cultivation takes place in Africa  most of the work is done by women  This favoured polygamous marriages in which men sought to monopolize the production of women  who are valued both as workers and as child bearers  Goody however  observes that the correlation is imperfect  He also discusses more male dominated but relatively extensive farming systems such as those that exist in much of West Africa  in particular the tribes of Northern Ghana on which his African studies often focused  where polygyny is desired more for the creation of sons whose labor is valued     Goody s observation regarding African male farming systems is discussed and supported by anthropologists Douglas R  White and Michael L  Burton in in  Causes of Polygyny  Ecology  Economy  Kinship  and Warfare  where authors note   Goody  1973  argues against the female contributions hypothesis  He notes Dorjahn s  1959  comparison of East and West Africa  showing higher female agricultural contributions in East Africa and higher polygyny rates in West Africa  especially in the West African savannah  where one finds especially high male agricultural contributions  Goody says   The reasons behind polygyny are sexual and reproductive rather than economic and productive   1973 189   arguing that men marry polygynously to maximize their fertility and to obtain large households containing many young dependent males    1 1 2  Types  Polygynous marriages can be distinguished between sororal polygyny  in which the co wives are sisters  and non sororal  where the co wives are not related  For men  the benefits of polygyny are that it allows them to have more children  may provide them with more productive workers  where workers are family   and allows them to establish politically useful ties with a greater number of kin groups  Polygyny is also associated with a greater age gap between husbands and wives  as men must marry younger girls for their second wives  This leaves younger men without wives for longer periods   Polygyny may also result from the practice of levirate marriage  In such cases  the deceased man s heir may inherit his assets and wife  or  more usually  his brothers may marry the widow  This provides support for the widow and her children  usually also members of the brothers  kin group  and maintains the tie between the husband and wives  kin groups  The sororate is like the levirate  in that a widower must marry the sister of his dead wife  The wife s family  in other words  must provide a replacement for her thus maintaining the ties between them  Both levirate and sororate may result in a man having multiple wives   Some polygynous marriages are same sex  In some societies such as the Lovedu in South Africa  aristocratic women who can afford to pay bridewealth in cattle can take wives and assume male political roles  Such a marriage could also be considered polyandrous since the main spouse is a woman   Even in monogamous societies  wealthy and powerful men established enduring relationships  and established separate household for  multiple female partners  This is a form of de facto polygyny that is also referred to as concubinage  or resource polygyny   1 1 3  Household organization  Marriage is the moment at which a new household is formed  but different arrangements may occur depending upon the type of marriage  Not all polygamous marriages result in the formation of a single household   1 1 3 1  Polygynous matrifocal households  In many polygynous marriages the husband s wives may live in separate households  often at a great distance  They can thus be described as a  series of linked nuclear families with a  father  in common   As such  they are similar to the household formations created through divorce and serial monogamy   1 1 3 2  Polygynous extended family households  1 2  Polyandry  1 2 1  Incidence  Polyandry is a practice wherein a woman has more than one husband at the same time  Polyandry is believed to be more likely in societies with scarce environmental resources  as it is believed to limit human population growth and enhance child survival  It is a rare form of marriage that exists not only among poor families  but also the elite  For example  in the Himalayan Mountains polyandry is related to the scarcity of land  the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided  If every brother married separately and had children  family land would be split into unsustainable small plots  In Europe  this was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance  the disinheriting of most siblings  many who went on to become celibate monks and priests    1 2 2  Types  Fraternal polyandry was traditionally practiced among nomadic Tibetans in Nepal  parts of China and part of northern India  in which two or more brothers are married to the same wife  with the wife having equal  sexual access  to them  It is most common in egalitarian societies marked by high male mortality or male absenteeism  It is associated with partible paternity  the cultural belief that a child can have more than one father   Non fraternal polyandry occurs when the wives  husbands are unrelated  as among the Nayar of India  In this case  a woman undergoes a ritual marriage before puberty  and he is acknowledged as the father of all her children  She  however  may never cohabit with him  taking multiple lovers instead  these men must acknowledge the paternity of their children  and hence demonstrate that no caste prohibitions have been breeched  by paying the midwife  The women remain in their maternal home  living with their brothers  and property is passed matrilineally  A similar form of matrilineal  de facto polyandry can be found in the institution of walking marriage among the Mosuo of China   1 2 3  Polyandrous extended family households  1 3  Serial monogamy  Serial monogamy refers to remarriage after death or divorce  i e  multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time   1 3 1  Incidence  Many societies that we consider monogamous in fact allow easy divorce  In many western countries divorce rates approach 50%  Those who remarry do so on average 3 times  Divorce and remarriage can thus result in serial monogamy  This can be interpreted as a form of plural mating  as are those societies dominated by female headed families in the Caribbean  Mauritius and Brazil where there is frequent rotation of unmarried spouses  In all these account for 16 to 24% of the  monogamous  category   1 3 2  Matrifocal households  Serial monogamy creates a new kind of relative  the  ex    The  ex wife   for example  remains an active part of her  ex husband s  life  as they may be tied together by transfers of resources  alimony  child support   or shared child custody  Bob Simpson notes that in the British case  serial monogamy creates an  extended family    a number of households tied together in this way  including mobile children  Simpson notes  you may have an ex wife  an ex brother in law  etc   but not an  ex child    These  unclear families  do not fit the mould of the monogamous nuclear family  As a series of connected households  they come to resemble the polygynous model of separate households maintained by mothers with children  tied by a male to whom they are married   1 4  Group marriage  Group marriage is a marriage wherein the family unit consists of more than two partners  any of whom share parental responsibility for any children arising from the marriage  Group marriage is a form of non monogamy and polyamory   2  Contemporary religious attitudes to polygamy  2 1  Buddhism  In Buddhism  marriage is not a sacrament  It is purely a secular affair and the monks do not participate in it  though in some sects priests and monks do marry  Hence it receives no religious sanction  Forms of marriage consequently vary from country to country  It is said in the Parabhava Sutta that  a man who is not satisfied with one woman and seeks out other women is on the path to decline   Other fragments in the Buddhist scripture can be found that seem to treat polygamy unfavorably  leading some authors to conclude that Buddhism generally does not approve of it or alternatively that it is a tolerated  but subordinate marital model   Until 2010 polygyny was legally recognized in Thailand  In Burma  polygyny was also frequent  In Sri Lanka  polyandry was practiced  though not widespread  until recent times  When the Buddhist texts were translated into Chinese  the concubines of others were added to the list of inappropriate partners  Polyandry in Tibet as well was common traditionally  as was polygyny  and having several wives or husbands was never regarded as having sex with inappropriate partners  Tibet is home to the largest and most flourishing polyandrous community in the world today  Most typically  fraternal polyandry is practiced  but sometimes father and son have a common wife  which is a unique family structure in the world  Other forms of marriage are also present  like group marriage and monogamous marriage  Polyandry  especially fraternal polyandry  is also common among Buddhists in Bhutan  Ladakh  and other parts of the Indian subcontinent   2 2  Celtic traditions  Some pre Christian Celtic pagans were known to practice polygamy  although the Celtic peoples wavered between it  monogamy and polyandry depending on the time period and area  In some areas this continued on even after Christianisation began  for instance the Brehon Laws of Gaelic Ireland explicitly allowed for polygamy  especially amongst the noble class  Some modern Celtic pagan religions accept the practice of polygamy to varying degrees  though how widespread the practice is within these religions is unknown   2 3  Christianity  The Bible states in the New Testament that polygamy should not be practiced  by certain church leaders   1 Timothy states that certain Church leaders should have but one wife   A bishop then must be blameless  the husband of one wife  vigilant  sober  of good behavior  given to hospitality  apt to teach   chapter 3  verse 2  see also verse 12 regarding deacons having only one wife   Similar counsel is repeated in the first chapter of the Epistle to Titus  1 Corinthians  chapter 7  verse 2  also writes   Nevertheless  to avoid fornication  let every man have his own wife  and let every woman have her own husband    Periodically  Christian reform movements that have aimed at rebuilding Christian doctrine based on the Bible alone  sola scriptura  have at least temporarily accepted polygyny as a Biblical practice  For example  during the Protestant Reformation  in a document referred to simply as  Der Beichtrat   or  The Confessional Advice     Martin Luther granted the Landgrave Philip of Hesse  who  for many years  had been living  constantly in a state of adultery and fornication   a dispensation to take a second wife  The double marriage was to be done in secret  however  to avoid public scandal  Some fifteen years earlier  in a letter to the Saxon Chancellor Gregor Brück  Luther stated that he could not  forbid a person to marry several wives  for it does not contradict Scripture     Ego sane fateor  me non posse prohibere  si quis plures velit uxores ducere  nec repugnat sacris literis      On February 14  1650  the parliament at Nürnberg decreed that  because so many men were killed during the Thirty Years  War  the churches for the following ten years could not admit any man under the age of 60 into a monastery  Priests and ministers not bound by any monastery were allowed to marry  Lastly  the decree stated that every man was allowed to marry up to ten women  The men were admonished to behave honorably  provide for their wives properly  and prevent animosity among them    The trend towards frequent divorce and remarriage is sometimes referred to as  serial polygamy   In contrast  others may refer to this as  serial monogamy   since it is a series of monogamous relationships  The first term highlights the multiplicity of marriages throughout the life cycle  the second the non simultaneous nature of these marriages   In Sub Saharan Africa  there has often been a tension between the Christian churches  insistence on monogamy and traditional polygamy  In some instances in recent times there have been moves for accommodation  in other instances  churches have resisted such moves strongly  African Independent Churches have sometimes referred to those parts of the Old Testament that describe polygamy in defending the practice   2 3 1  Roman Catholic Church  The Roman Catholic Church clearly condemns polygamy  the Catechism of the Catholic Church lists it in paragraph 2387 under the head  Other offenses against the dignity of marriage  and states that it  is not in accord with the moral law   Also in paragraph 1645 under the head  The Goods and Requirements of Conjugal Love  states  The unity of marriage  distinctly recognized by our Lord  is made clear in the equal personal dignity which must be accorded to husband and wife in mutual and unreserved affection  Polygamy is contrary to conjugal love which is undivided and exclusive    Saint Augustine saw a conflict with Old Testament polygamy  He refrained from judging the patriarchs  but did not deduce from their practice the ongoing acceptability of polygyny  On the contrary  he argued that the polygamy of the Fathers  which was tolerated by the Creator because of fertility  was a diversion from His original plan for human marriage  Augustine wrote  That the good purpose of marriage  however  is better promoted by one husband with one wife  than by a husband with several wives  is shown plainly enough by the very first union of a married pair  which was made by the Divine Being Himself   Augustine taught that the reason patriarchs had many wives was not because of fornication  but because they wanted more children  He supported his premise by showing that their marriages  in which husband was the head  were arranged according to the rules of good management  those who are in command  quae principantur  in their society were always singular  while subordinates  subiecta  were multiple  He gave two examples of such relationships  dominus servus   master servant  in older translation  slave  and God soul  The Bible often equates worshiping multiple gods  i e  idolatry to fornication  Augustine relates to that  On this account there is no True God of souls  save One  but one soul by means of many false gods may commit fornication  but not be made fruitful   As tribal populations grew  fertility was no longer a valid justification of polygamy  it was lawful among the ancient fathers  whether it be lawful now also  I would not hastily pronounce  utrum et nunc fas sit  non temere dixerim   For there is not now necessity of begetting children  as there then was  when  even when wives bear children  it was allowed  in order to a more numerous posterity  to marry other wives in addition  which now is certainly not lawful    Augustine saw marriage as a non sacrament friendly covenant between one man and one woman  which may not be broken  It was the Creator who established monogamy  Therefore the first natural bond of human society is man and wife  Such marriage was confirmed by the Saviour in the Gospel of Matthew  Mat 19 9  and by His presence at the wedding in Cana  John 2 2   In the Church—the City of God—marriage is a sacrament and may not and cannot be dissolved as long as the spouses live  But a marriage once for all entered upon in the City of our God  where  even from the first union of the two  the man and the woman  marriage bears a certain sacramental character  can in no way be dissolved but by the death of one of them   In chapter 7  Augustine pointed out that the Roman Empire forbad polygamy  even if the reason of fertility would support it  For it is in a man s power to put away a wife that is barren  and marry one of whom to have children  And yet it is not allowed  and now indeed in our times  and after the usage of Rome  nostris quidem iam temporibus ac more Romano   neither to marry in addition  so as to have more than one wife living  Further on he notices that the Church s attitude goes much further than the secular law regarding monogamy  It forbids re marrying  considering such to be a form of fornication  And yet  save in the City of our God  in His Holy Mount  the case is not such with the wife  But  that the laws of the Gentiles are otherwise  who is there that knows not    In modern times a minority of Roman Catholic theologians have argued that polygyny  though not ideal  can be a legitimate form of Christian marriage in certain regions  in particular Africa  The Roman Catholic Church teaches in its Catechism that   polygamy is not in accord with the moral law   Conjugal  communion is radically contradicted by polygamy  this  in fact  directly negates the plan of God that was revealed from the beginning  because it is contrary to the equal personal dignity of men and women who in matrimony give themselves with a love that is total and therefore unique and exclusive   The illegality of polygamy in certain areas creates  according to certain Bible passages  additional arguments against it  Paul of Tarsus writes  submit to the authorities  not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience   Romans 13 5   for  the authorities that exist have been established by God    Romans 13 1  St Peter concurs when he says to  submit yourselves for the Lord s sake to every authority instituted among men  whether to the king  as the supreme authority  or to governors  who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right    1 Peter 2 13 14  Pro polygamists argue that  as long as polygamists currently do not obtain legal marriage licenses nor seek  common law marriage status  for additional spouses  no enforced laws are being broken any more than when monogamous couples similarly co habitate without a marriage license   2 3 2  Mormonism  The history of Mormon polygamy  specifically polygyny  began with Joseph Smith  Jr   who stated he received a revelation on July 17  1831 that  plural marriage  should be practiced by some Mormon men who were specifically commanded to do so  This was later published in the Doctrine and Covenants by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  LDS Church   Despite Smith s revelation  the 1835 edition of the 101st Section of the Doctrine and Covenants  written after the doctrine of plural marriage began to be practiced  publicly condemned polygamy  This scripture was used by John Taylor in 1850 to quash Mormon polygamy rumors in Liverpool  England  Polygamy was made illegal in the state of Illinois during the 1839–44 Nauvoo era when several top Mormon leaders  including Smith  Brigham Young and Heber C  Kimball took multiple wives  Mormon elders who publicly taught that all men were commanded to enter plural marriage were subject to harsh discipline  On June 7  1844 the Nauvoo Expositor criticized Smith for plural marriage  After Joseph Smith s murder by a mob on June 27  1844  the main body of Mormons left Nauvoo and followed Brigham Young to Utah where the practice of plural marriage continued   In 1852 Brigham Young  the second president of the LDS Church  publicly acknowledged the practice of plural marriage through a sermon he gave  Additional sermons by top Mormon leaders on the virtues of polygamy followed  Controversy followed when polygamy became a social cause  writers began to publish works condemning polygamy  The key plank of the Republican Party s 1856 platform was  to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism  polygamy and slavery   In 1862  Congress issued the Morrill Anti Bigamy Act which clarified that the practice of polygamy was illegal in all US territories  The LDS Church believed that their religiously based practice of plural marriage was protected by the United States Constitution  however  the unanimous 1878 Supreme Court decision Reynolds v  United States declared that polygamy was not protected by the Constitution  based on the longstanding legal principle that  laws are made for the government of actions  and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions  they may with practices    Increasingly harsh anti polygamy legislation in the US led some Mormons to emigrate to Canada and Mexico  In 1890  LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff issued a public declaration  the Manifesto  announcing that the LDS Church had discontinued new plural marriages  Anti Mormon sentiment waned  as did opposition to statehood for Utah  The Smoot Hearings in 1904  which documented that the LDS Church was still practicing polygamy spurred the LDS Church to issue a Second Manifesto again claiming that it had ceased performing new plural marriages  By 1910 the LDS Church excommunicated those who entered into  or performed  new plural marriages  Even so  many plural husbands and wives continued to cohabit until their deaths in the 1940s and 1950s   Enforcement of the 1890 Manifesto caused various splinter groups to leave the LDS Church in order to continue the practice of plural marriage  Polygamy among these groups persists today in Utah and neighboring states as well as in the spin off colonies  Polygamist churches of Mormon origin are often referred to as  Mormon fundamentalist  even though they are not a part of the LDS Church  Such fundamentalists often use a purported 1886 revelation to John Taylor as the basis for their authority to continue the practice of plural marriage  The Salt Lake Tribune stated in 2005 there were as many as 37 000 fundamentalists with less than half of them living in polygamous households   On December 13  2013  US Federal Judge Clark Waddoups ruled in Brown v  Buhman that the portions of Utah s anti polygamy laws which prohibit multiple cohabitation were unconstitutional  but also allowed Utah to maintain its ban on multiple marriage licenses  Unlawful cohabitation  where prosecutors did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place  only that a couple had lived together   had been the primary tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 Edmunds Act   2 4  Hinduism  The Hindu Marriage Act was enacted in 1955 by the Indian Parliament and made polygamy in any form illegal in India  Prior to 1955  polygamy was permitted for Indian Hindus  Marriage laws in India are dependent upon the religion of the parties in question  The terms under the Hindu Marriage Act  1954 has deemed polygamy to be illegal for Hindus  Jains  Buddhists  and Sikhs  Only Muslim men in India are allowed to have up to 4 wives  as they are subject to Sharia law   There was one example of polyandry in the ancient Hindu epic  Mahabharata  Draupadi marries the five Pandava brothers  Regarding polygyny  in Ramayana  father of Ram  King Dasharath has three wives  but Ram has pledged himself just one wife   In the post Vedic periods  polygamy declined in Hinduism  and is now considered immoral   2 5  Islam  In Islam  polygyny is allowed  with the specific limitation that a man can have four wives at any one time  The Muslim Prophet Muhammad had total nine wives  but not all at the same time  depending on the sources in his lifetime  He had nine wives at the time of his death  The Qur an clearly states that men who choose this route must deal with their wives justly  If the husband fears that he cannot deal with his wives justly  then he should only marry one  The Qur an does not give preference in marrying more than one wife but allows it to make it easier on a woman who has no support  A husband does not have to have permission from his first wife  However  the wife can set a condition  before marriage  that the husband cannot marry another woman during their marriage  In such a case  the husband cannot marry another woman as long as he is married to his wife   Women  on the other hand  are only allowed to marry one husband  although they are allowed to remarry after a divorce  Although many Muslim countries still retain traditional Islamic law that permits polygyny  secular elements within some Muslim societies challenge its acceptability  Polygyny is prohibited by law in some Muslim majority countries that have not adopted Islamic law for marital regulations  such as Azerbaijan  Tunisia and Turkey   Polygyny  and laws concerning polygyny  differ greatly throughout the Islamic world and form a very complex and diverse background from nation to nation  Whereas in some Muslim countries it may be fairly common  in most others it is often rare or non existent  According to traditional Islamic law  a man may take up to four wives  and each of those wives must have her own property  assets  and dowry  Usually the wives have little to no contact with each other and lead separate  individual lives in their own houses  and sometimes in different cities  though they all share the same husband   In the modern Islamic world  polygyny is found in Saudi Arabia  and West and East Africa  in Sudan it was encouraged by the President Omar al Bashir in 2001 to increase the population  Among the 22 member states of the Arab League  Tunisia alone explicitly prohibits polygyny  however  it is generally frowned upon in many of the more secularized Arab states  such as Egypt  Few other countries including Libya and Morocco require the written permission of the first wife if her husband wishes to marry a second  third  or fourth wife   2 6  Judaism  Multiple marriage was considered a realistic alternative in the case of famine  widowhood  or female infertility like in the practice of levirate marriage  wherein a man was required to marry and support his deceased brother s widow  as mandated by   Despite its prevalence in the Hebrew bible  scholars do not believe that polygyny was commonly practiced in the biblical era because it required a significant amount of wealth  Michael Coogan  in contrast  states that  Polygyny continued to be practised well into the biblical period  and it is attested among Jews as late as the second century CE    The Torah  Judaism s central text  includes a few specific regulations on the practice of polygamy  such as Exodus 21 10   If he take another wife for himself  her food  her clothing  and her duty of marriage  shall he not diminish     states that a man must award the inheritance due to a first born son to the son who was actually born first  even if he hates that son s mother and likes another wife more  and states that the king shall not have too many wives  The king s behavior is condemned by Prophet Samuel in    The understanding of the Jewish perspective on co wives may also be derived from the Hebrew word for co wife found in the Tanakh   צרה   Tza rah   which forms the same root as the Yiddush word   צרות   Tzoo rus   meaning  trouble    It is important to note  as explained by Israeli lexicographer Vadim Cherny  that the Torah carefully distinguishes concubines and  sub standard  wives with prefix  to   lit   took to wives    Despite these nuances to the biblical perspective on polygamy  many important figures had more than one wife  such as in the instances of Esau  Gen 26 34  28 6 9   Moses  Ex 2 21 Num 12 1   Jacob  Gen 29 15 28   Elkanah  1 Samuel 1 1 8   David  1 Samuel 25 39 44  2 Samuel 3 2 5  5 13 16   and Solomon  1 Kings 11 1 3    The monogamy of the Roman Empire was the cause of two explanatory notes in the writings of Josephus describing how the polygamous marriages of Herod were permitted under Jewish custom   The Rabbinical era that began with the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE saw a continuation of some degree of legal acceptance for polygamy  In the Babylonian Talmud  BT   Kiddushin 7a  its states   Raba said   If a man declares    Be thou betrothed to half of me   she is betrothed   half of thee be betrothed to me   she is not betrothed   The BT during a discussion of Levirate marriage in Yevamot 65a appears to repeat the precedent found in Exodus 21 10   Raba said  a man may marry wives in addition to the first wife  provided only that he possesses the means to maintain them   The Jewish Codices began a process of restricting polygamy in Judaism  The Rambam s Mishneh Torah  while maintaining the right to multiple spouses  and the requirement to provide fully for each as indicated in previously cited sources  went further   He may not  however  compel his wives to live in the same courtyard  Instead  each one is entitled to her own household   Finally  the most authoritative codex  the Shulchan Aruch  builds on all of the previous works by adding further nuances   …but in any event  our sages have advised well not to marry more than four wives  in order that he can meet their conjugal needs at least once a month  And in a place where it is customary to marry only one wife  he is not permitted to take another wife on top of his present wife   As can be seen  while the tradition of the Rabbinic period began with providing legal definition for the practice of polygamy  although this does not indicate the frequency with which polygamy in fact occurred  that corresponded to precedents in the tanakh  by the time of the Codices the Rabbis had greatly reduced or eliminated sanction of the practice   Most notable in the Rabbinic period on the issue of polygamy  though more specifically for Ashkenazi Jews  was the synod of Rabbeinu Gershom  About 1000 CE he called a synod which decided the following particulars   1  prohibition of polygamy   2  necessity of obtaining the consent of both parties to a divorce   3  modification of the rules concerning those who became apostates under compulsion   4  prohibition against opening correspondence addressed to another  These prohibitions remained in force for one thousand years   In the modern day  polygamy is almost nonexistent in Rabbinic Judaism  Ashkenazi Jews have continued to follow Rabbenu Gershom s ban since the 11th century   Among Karaite Jews  who do not adhere to Rabbinic interpretations of the Torah  polygamy is almost non existent today  Like other Jews  Karaites interpret to mean that a man can only take a second wife if his first wife gives her consent  Keter Torah on Leviticus  pp  96–97  and Karaites interpret Exodus 21 10 to mean that a man can only take a second wife if he is capable of maintaining the same level of marital duties due to his first wife  the marital duties are 1  food  2  clothing  and 3  sexual gratification  Because of these two biblical limitations and because most countries outlaw it  polygamy is considered highly impractical  and there are only a few known cases of it among Karaite Jews today   Israel has made polygamy illegal  Provisions were instituted to allow for existing polygamous families immigrating from countries where the practice was legal  Furthermore  former chief rabbi Ovadia Yosef has come out in favor of legalizing polygamy and the practice of pilegesh  concubine  by the Israeli government   Tzvi Zohar  a professor from the Bar Ilan University  recently suggested that based on the opinions of leading halachic authorities  the concept of concubines may serve as a practical Halachic justification for premarital or non marital cohabitation   3  Criticism  Evolution pioneer Charles Darwin alleged that men have historically practiced polygamy as a way to both please their sexual desire and maintain household dominance  In his 1871 book The Descent of Man  Darwin stated that  Judging from the social habits of man as he now exists  and from most savages being polygamists  the most probable view is that primeval man aboriginally lived in small communities  each with as many wives as he could support and obtain  whom he would have jealously guarded against all other men    Refuting allegations that polygamy helps reduce the rate of poverty among struggling widows and orphans  a medical study conducted by the Croatian Medical Journal in African nations that legalized the practice found the odds are more likely that families of men having the right to marry multiple wives will conceive more children for whom it would cost more to provide  The study also noted that the temptation for sexual intercourse that has often come with polygamy  regardless of whether a man has multiple wives or vice versa  has been a major contributor to the HIV AIDS epidemic in Africa as well   Also  a 2012 study from the University of British Columbia shows that  in polygamist cultures   the intra sexual competition that occurs causes greater levels of crime  violence  poverty and gender inequality than in societies that institutionalize and practice monogamous marriage    Additionally  a 2013 study published in the International Journal of Psychology and Counselling showed  that there is a significant difference in the overall academic achievement of students from monogamous families and those from polygamous families  and  that life in polygamous family can be traumatic and children brought up in such family structure often suffer some emotional problems such as lack of warmth  love despite availability of money and material resources  and disciplinary problems which may hinder their academic performance    4  Legalization  4 1  United States  Polygamy is currently illegal in the United States  On December 13  2013  a federal judge  spurred by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups  struck down the parts of Utah s bigamy law that criminalized cohabitation  while also acknowledging that the state may still enforce bans on having multiple marriage licenses   In the U S   the Libertarian Party supports complete decriminalization of polygamy as part of a general belief that the government should not regulate marriages  Individualist feminism and advocates such as Wendy McElroy and journalist Jillian Keenan also support the freedom for adults to voluntarily enter polygamous marriages   In an October 2004 op ed for USA Today  George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley  argued that  as a simple matter of equal treatment under law  polygamy ought to be legal  Acknowledging that underage girls are sometimes coerced into polygamous marriages  Turley replied that banning polygamy is no more a solution to child abuse than banning marriage would be a solution to spousal abuse    There is another  more  conservative  case for polygamy  too   By legitimizing polygamy and allowing its practitioners to join mainstream society  we can monitor and regulate the practice  thereby reducing any problems  On Big Love  for example  one polygamous wife won t visit a hospital for fear of alerting the authorities  Legalize polygamy  the argument goes  and marriage and divorce law will protect polygamous wives  instead of scaring them into hiding    Stanley Kurtz  a fellow at the Hudson Institute  however  lamented the modern arguments made by intellectuals calling for de criminalizing polygamy  Kurtz concluded   Marriage  as its ultramodern critics would like to say  is indeed about choosing one s partner  and about freedom in a society that values freedom  But that s not the only thing it is about  As the Supreme Court justices who unanimously decided Reynolds in 1878 understood  marriage is also about sustaining the conditions in which freedom can thrive  Polygamy in all its forms is a recipe for social structures that inhibit and ultimately undermine social freedom and democracy  A hard won lesson of Western history is that genuine democratic self rule begins at the hearth of the monogamous family    5  See also  Hypergamy  Conflict of
