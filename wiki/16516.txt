alongside groups such as Incognito  the James Taylor Quartet  and the Brand New Heavies  Subsequent albums have explored other musical directions such as pop  rock  and electronica  Their best known track  particularly in North America  is  Virtual Insanity   which won four awards at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards as well as Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at

Sola Akingbola  since 1994   and drummer Derrick McKenzie  since 1994   Kay was the impetus behind the formation of Jamiroquai  deciding to form the band after an unsuccessful audition to become the singer of the Brand New Heavies  Although he has said that he has attempted to have Jamiroquai treated as a band  Kay has always been at the forefront   Jamiroquai s first single   When You Gonna Learn   was released in 1992 on the Acid Jazz label  Following its success  Kay signed an eight album record deal with Sony Music Entertainment  The first Sony album  Emergency on Planet Earth was released in 1993  It was followed in 1994 by The Return of the Space Cowboy  The single  Space Cowboy  gained notice on the charts and in club rotation   While Jamiroquai were growing in popularity in the UK  Western Europe  Australia  New Zealand and Japan  they remained relatively unknown to U S and other international audiences  The band s American breakthrough came with the third album  Travelling Without Moving in 1996  which yielded two big hits   Virtual Insanity  and  Cosmic Girl   The success of  Virtual Insanity  was due in part to its Jonathan Glazer directed video  which featured Kay s dance moves and some physics defying images  At the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards  the creative music video for  Virtual Insanity  won four awards  Best Video  Best Special Effects  Best Cinematography  and Breakthrough Video  and the band performed the song at the ceremony   1 2  1998–2003  Synkronized  A Funk Odyssey and changes to style and line up  In 1998  Jamiroquai released  Deeper Underground   the first single from their fourth studio album  Synkronized  which also appeared in the soundtrack for the 1998 movie Godzilla  The acid jazz flavours and ethnic influences of the first three albums continued with the release of Synkronized  and Jay Kay s interest in funk and disco music were shifting the band s directions towards such  By their fifth album  A Funk Odyssey  2001   they had evolved so drastically  that some critics and listeners would remark they lost the  Jamiroquai sound   With the departure of more and more original band members  including Wallis Buchanan and his didgeridoo  Jamiroquai had become a very different band from that of 1992  In spite of the changes  the fifth album s first single   Little L   reached No  1 in many charts worldwide becoming their best dance hit   In 2003  Jamiroquai compiled and mixed a DJ mix album for the Late Night Tales series for Azuli Records  The track selection shows some of the band s soul  funk and disco influences  including tracks from The Pointer Sisters  The Commodores  Johnny  Hammond  Smith and Johnny  Guitar  Watson   1 3  2004–06  Dynamite  High Times  Singles 1992–2006 and end of

experimentation and lack of pressure from a record company   1 5  2008–12  Rock Dust Light Star  In January 2008  the band confirmed that the recording process for their latest album had begun

Jamiroquai s releases  The image was created sometime prior to the release of their 1992 single When You Gonna Learn  Allegedly it was originally sketched by the front man Jay Kay  as Buffalo Man is seemingly a self portrait silhouette of Kay wearing a buffalo hat  It is based on the Minotaur from the Greek fable  Theseus and the Minotaur   Jay Kay stated  I really identify with Theseus  In fact  I d say I am the most similar person to Theseus to come out of Stretford in the past 50 years   The mark has been used on almost every commercial  and sometimes non commercial  release of the band s output in some form or another  usually the unique symbol is pictured unaltered  but there have been times where it is shown in a stylised manner to suit the artwork or song   Over the years  Buffalo Man has seen some temporary changes or interesting thematic uses    Half the Man   The Return of the Space Cowboy For the single  Half The Man   Buffalo Man is on the cover as a keyring with a heart in the clasp representing the fact it is a love song and the keyring itself is split down the middle in two halves to represent the song title  Buffalo Man also has a silver heart    Space Cowboy   The Return of the Space Cowboy For the single  Space Cowboy   Buffalo Man is present on the cover as a shaped cigarette paper for a half complete cannabis joint  in reference to the song s praise of the drug    Virtual Insanity   Travelling Without Moving For the single of  Virtual Insanity   Buffalo Man appears in the place of the Ferrari horse in an homage to Jason s love of sports cars  For the album cover to Travelling Without Moving  the artwork is similar  but takes on an embossed effect and is seen on a metal grille    Cosmic Girl    Everyday  For these two releases  Buffalo Man is pictured with a star over his heart and two intersecting orbital rings   Synkronized While the design remained fundamentally unaltered  Buffalo Man has been turned into a laser cut mirror and photographed from interesting angles by Midori Tsukagoshi  On some editions  for the disc itself  no ink has been used on the character  but the same stone background found on the front cover has been used for the rest of the disc  thus allowing the consumer to recreate the photographed effect   A Funk Odyssey For this album  the Buffalo Man was notably absent from the cover  instead  the laser lights formed an outline of the Buffalo Man logo  which could be seen much more clearly in the album s liner notes   Dynamite The US release and the double disc Australian Tour Edition featured a gold Buffalo Man  Other releases saw a picture of Jay Kay instead   Rock Dust Light Star The letter  i  in the title is replaced with the Buffalo Man  making the first appearance in a Jamiroquai album cover since 1999 s Synkronized  not counting the alternative artwork for Dynamite   The US cover for the album features a glossy yellow Buffalo Man standing upon a glowing floor  The vinyl release also features another cover including the Buffalo Man   3  Tours  4  Personnel   Current members  Jay Kay – lead vocals  1992–present   Derrick McKenzie – drums  1994–present   Sola Akingbola –
