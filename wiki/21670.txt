New Zealand English  NZE  en NZ  is the dialect of the English language used in New Zealand   The English language was established in New Zealand by colonists during the 19th century  It is one of  the newest native speaker variet ies  of the English language in existence  a variety which has developed and become distinctive only in the last 150 years   The most distinctive influences on New Zealand English have come from Australian English  English in southern England  Irish English  Scottish English  the prestige Received Pronunciation  and Māori  New Zealand English is most similar to Australian English in pronunciation  with some key differences  One of the most prominent differences is the realisation of   in New Zealand English  as in some Scots and South African varieties  this is pronounced as    1  Dictionaries  The first comprehensive dictionary dedicated to New Zealand English was probably the Heinemann New Zealand Dictionary  published in 1979  Edited by Harry Orsman  it is a 1 300 page book  with information relating to the usage and pronunciation of terms that were widely accepted throughout the English speaking world and those peculiar to New Zealand  It includes a one page list of the approximate date of entry into common parlance of the many terms found in New Zealand English but not elsewhere  such as  haka   1827    Boohai   1920   and  bach   1905   A second edition was published in 1989 and a third edition  published by Reed Publishing and edited by Nelson Wattie was published in 2001   In 1997  Oxford University Press produced The Dictionary of New Zealand English  which it claimed was based on over 40 years of research  This research started with Orsman s 1951 thesis and continued with his editing this dictionary  To assist with and maintain this work  the New Zealand Dictionary Centre was founded in 1997  It has published several more dictionaries of New Zealand English  including The New Zealand Oxford Paperback Dictionary  edited by New Zealand lexicographer Tony Deverson in 1998  culminating in The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary in 2004  by Tony Deverson and Graeme Kennedy  A second  revised edition of The New Zealand Oxford Paperback Dictionary was published in 2006  this time using standard lexicographical regional markers to identify the NZ content which were absent in the first edition   Another authoritative work is the Collins English Dictionary published by HarperCollins which contains an abundance of well cited New Zealand words and phrases drawing from the 650 million word Bank of English a British research facility set up at the University of Birmingham in 1980 and funded by Collins publishers  Although this is a British dictionary of International English there has always been a credited New Zealand advisor for the New Zealand content  most recently Elizabeth Gordon from the University of Canterbury since the 6th edition  2003    A more light hearted look at English as spoken in New Zealand  A Personal Kiwi Yankee Dictionary  was written by the American born University of Otago psychology lecturer Louis Leland in 1980  This slim volume lists many of the potentially confusing and or misleading terms for Americans visiting or emigrating to New Zealand  A second edition was published in 1990   2  Historical development  From the 1790s  New Zealand was visited by British  French and American whaling  sealing and trading ships  Their crews traded European goods with the indigenous Maori  The first actual settlers to New Zealand were mainly from Australia  many ex convicts or escaped convicts  Sailors  explorers and traders from Australia and other parts of Europe also settled  In 1788 the colony of New South Wales of Australia had been founded  The colony included most of New Zealand except for the southern half of the South Island  In 1839  the New Zealand Company announced its plans to establish colonies in New Zealand  This  and the continuing lawlessness of many of the established Australian and European settlers  spurred the British to take better control of the colony which until then the British had largely ignored  The European population of New Zealand grew explosively from fewer than 1000 in 1831 to 500 000 by 1881  From 1840 there was considerable European settlement  primarily from England and Wales  Scotland and Ireland  and to a lesser extent the United States  India  China  and various parts of continental Europe  Some 400 000 settlers came from Britain  of whom 300 000 stayed permanently  Most were young people and 250 000 babies were born  Administered at first as a part of the Australian colony of New South Wales  New Zealand became a colony in its own right on 1 July 1841  Gold discoveries in Otago  1861  and Westland  1865   caused a worldwide gold rush that more than doubled the population in a short period  from 71 000 in 1859 to 164 000 in 1863  In the 1870s and 1880s  several thousand Chinese men  mostly from Guangdong province  migrated to New Zealand to work on the South Island goldfields  Although the first Chinese migrants had been invited by the Otago Provincial government they quickly became the target of hostility from white settlers and laws were enacted specifically to discourage them from coming to New Zealand thereafter  By 1911 the number of European settlers  called Pākehā by Māori  had reached a million  With this colourful history of unofficial and official settlement of peoples from all over Europe  Australia and Asia and the intermingling of the people with the indigenous Maori brought about what would eventually evolve into a  New Zealand accent  and a unique regional English lexicon   A distinct New Zealand variant of the English language has been recognized since at least 1912  when Frank Arthur Swinnerton described it as a  carefully modulated murmur   From the beginning of the haphazard Australian and European settlements and latter official British migrations  a new dialect began to form by adopting Māori words to describe the different flora and fauna of New Zealand  for which English did not have any words of its own  Early spoken New Zealand English was a mix of British and Australian dialects  accounting for the eventual similarity between Australian and New Zealand English as they co developed in the 19th and 20th centuries   Since the latter 20th Century New Zealand society has gradually divested itself of it s fundamentally British roots and has adopted influences from all over the world  especially in the early 21st Century when New Zealand experienced an increase of non British immigration which has since brought about a more prominent multi national society  The Internet  television  movies and popular music have all brought international influences into New Zealand society and the New Zealand lexicon  Americanization of New Zealand society and language has subtly and gradually been taking place since World War II and especially since the 1970s  as has happened also in neighbouring Australia   3  Phonology  Not all New Zealanders have the same accent  as the level of cultivation  i e  the extremity  of every speaker s accent differs  Some speakers may have a very cultivated accent  in which case they will speak much like the phonology described in this section  Other speakers  however  may have a quite broad accent  meaning they shall sound less like the phonology described  The phonology in this section is of a cultivated speaker of New Zealand English and does not reflect how all New Zealanders sound   3 1  Vowels  The vowels of New Zealand English are similar to that of other non rhotic dialects such as Australian English and RP  but with some distinct variations  which are indicated by the transcriptions for New Zealand vowels in the tables below   However  vowel charts show that aren t accurate transcriptions  and approximate the actual pronunciation closer   3 1 1  Short front vowels  In New Zealand English the short i of is a central vowel not phonologically distinct from schwa   the vowel in unstressed  the   both of which are a close mid central unrounded vowel   It thus contrasts sharply with the vowel heard in Australia  Recent acoustic studies featuring both Australian and New Zealand voices show the accents were more similar before the Second World War and the vowel has undergone rapid centralisation in New Zealand English  Because of this difference in pronunciation  some New Zealanders claim Australians say  feesh and cheeps  for fish and chips while some Australians counter that New Zealanders say  fush and chups   In actual fact the vowel can sometimes be mistaken for the vowel in some speakers so that  fish and chips  may sound like  firsh and chirps   non rhotic  in some speakers rather than the incorrectly noted  fush and chups  stereotype  Thus the words  bitch  and  birch  maybe difficult to discern by a non New Zealander   Like South African English  some Australian and some Southern American dialects  the vowel has moved to become a close mid vowel   although the New Zealand is closer to   This was played for laughs in the American TV series Flight of the Conchords  where the character Bret s name was often pronounced as  Brit   leading to confusion  In broader uses  especially in the South Island  the vowel in some single vowel words is replaced by the  ɪə  vowel  almost becoming two syllables as with broad Southern American  so that words like  pen  sound like  pee yin  and  pest  becomes  pee ist    3 1 2  Conditioned mergers  The and vowels are increasingly being merged  so that here rhymes with there  and bear and beer  and rarely and really are homophones  Thus  Air New Zealand  and  Ear New Zealand  are identical  There is some debate as to the quality of the merged vowel  but the consensus appears to be that it is towards a close variant    This merger is not unique to New Zealand and also occurs in East Anglia in the UK and South Carolina in the United States   Before   the vowels and  as in reel vs real   as well as and  doll vs dole   and sometimes and  pull vs pool   and  Ellen vs Alan  and and  full vs fill  may be merged   3 1 3  Other vowels  As with Australian English the vowel in words like ‘park’  pa k   ‘calm’  ka m  and ‘farm’  fa m  is central or even front of central in terms of tongue position and non rhotic  This is the same vowel sound used by speakers of the Boston accent and other non rhotic areas of North Eastern New England in the United States  Thus the phrase  park the car  is said identically by a New Zealander  Australian or Bostonian  Can t is also pronounced  ka nt  in both New Zealand and Australia and not  knt  as in United States and Canada   The most obvious vowel shift in New Zealand English from other kinds is the vowel which is usually realised as a slightly raised in the majority of New Zealanders  In Broader varieties it is often raised to   so that encroaches on for some speakers  This vowel shift is shared by South African English speakers and is one of the main reasons American English speakers may mistake New Zealanders for South Africans  In the phrase  the cat sat on the mat  this is heard by the rest of the English speaking world as  the ket set on the met   A  laptop  is heard by non New Zealanders as  leptop  and a  tablet  as a  teblet    The vowel is rounded and often fronted in the region of    The vowel is a close mid back rounded vowel   as is in Australian and South African English   3 2  Consonants  New Zealand English is mostly non rhotic  with linking and intrusive R   except for speakers with the so called Southland burr  a semi rhotic  Scottish influenced dialect heard principally in Southland and parts of Otago  Among r less speakers  however  non prevocalic is sometimes pronounced in a few words  including Ireland  merely  err  and the name of the letter R  A fairly accurate representation of the rhotic Southern New Zealand accent was depicted in The World s Fastest Indian a movie about the life of New Zealander Burt Monro and his achievements at Bonneville Speedway  On the DVD release of the movie one of the Special Features is Roger Donaldson s original 1971 documentary Offerings to the God of Speed featuring the real Burt Monroe  His southern New Zealand accent is definitive   is dark in all positions  and is often vocalised in the syllable coda  This varies in different regions and between different socio economic groups  the younger  lower social class speakers vocalise most of the time   3 2 1  Other consonants  New Zealand English has the wine whine merger  thus the distinction between as in witch and as in which has disappeared except in the speech of older speakers   As with Australian English and American English the intervocalic may be flapped so that in the sentence  use a little bit of butter  becomes  use a liddle bid of budder    3 3  Other features  New Zealand English has the trap–bath split  words like dance  chance  plant and grant are pronounced with an sound  as in Southern England and South Australia   Some New Zealand speakers have the salary–celery merger and would thus pronounce as   For instance  elephant would be pronounced or   cell and sell   and elegy   being homophonous with allergy  Other speakers  however  do make a distinction between and    Some New Zealanders pronounce past participles such as grown  thrown and mown with two syllables  the latter containing a schwa not found in other accents  By contrast  groan  throne and moan are all unaffected  meaning these word pairs can be distinguished by ear   The trans  prefix is usually pronounced   This produces mixed pronunciation of the as in words like transplant   However  is sometimes heard in older persons of staunch British heritage   The name of the letter H is almost always   as in North America  and is almost never aspirated      The name of the letter Z is usually the British  Canadian and Australian zed  However the Alphabet Song for children is always sung ending with zee in accordance with the rhyme  As with much modern spoken New Zealand English  this and other earlier hard and fast rules are gradually becoming a thing of the past and zee pronunciation is being heard more frequently  although never in abbreviations such as ANZ  NZ  TVNZ or in the name of the renamed Shell Service Stations  which are now called  Z    The word foyer is usually pronounced   as in Australian English  rather than as in British English   The word with is almost always pronounced   though may be found in some minority groups   Like in the UK  the word and combining form graph is pronounced both and    The word data is commonly pronounced   with being the second commonest  and being very rare   Words such as contribute and distribute are predominantly pronounced with the stress on the second syllable   tri   Variants with the stress on the first syllable are also used   Common in spoken New Zealand is the use of the word  like  as a quotative  discourse marker or as a hedge  similar to its use in  Valleyspeak  belonging to the  Valley Girl  stereotype of the United States  This appears to have been adopted by young New Zealanders during the 1980s when  Valleyspeak  became popularized internationally through music and media of the time  Katie Drager  assistant professor in sociolinguistics at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa  showed that New Zealand English speakers have distinct uses for ‘like’ and that they pronounce each type of ‘like’ slightly differently  so that e g  “He was like ‘yeah’ and she was like ‘no’” would have a different pronunciation from “And  like  it was raining”   Australian English did not develop in this way and thus this feature remains a distinct difference between Australian and New Zealand colloquial English   Like Canadian English  New Zealand English is well known for the frequent use of the word  eh   where it is used by New Zealanders after sentences to mean many things such as  is it     isn t it    it definitely is    excuse me pardon    do you agree     that is true    what     are you serious     didn t you  accusative     I mean what I said   etc  The Maori word  nei  has similar meaning and usage  The New Zealand usage of the word  eh  is also increasingly filtering into Australian English and can often be heard in similar usages especially by Western Australians and Sydneysiders  possibly due to the higher numbers of New Zealand immigrants living in those areas  Queenslanders too claim the use of  eh  to be a marker of their local dialect which is unattributed to any New Zealand influence   4  Vocabulary  There are a number of dialectal words and phrases used in New Zealand English  These are mostly informal terms that are more common in casual speech  A considerable number of loan words have also been taken from the Maori language as well as from Australian English   see the separate section  below    New Zealand adopted decimal currency in the 1960s and the metric system in the 1970s  Despite this  several imperial measures are still widely encountered and usually understood  such as feet and inches for a person s height  pounds and ounces for an infant s birth weight  and in colloquial terms such as referring to drinks in pints  In the food manufacturing industry in New Zealand both metric and non metric systems of weight are used and usually understood owing to raw food products being imported from both metric and non metric countries  However per the December 1976 Weights and Measures Amendment Act  all foodstuffs must be retailed using the metric system  In general  the knowledge of non metric units is lessening   The word spud for potato  now common throughout the English speaking world  originated in New Zealand English   As with Australian English  but in contrast to most other forms of the language  some speakers of New Zealand English use both the terms bath and bathe as verbs  with bath used as a transitive verb  e g  I will bath the dog   and bathe used predominantly  but not exclusively  as an intransitive verb  e g  Did you bathe     Both the words amongst and among are used  as in British English  The same is true for two other pairs  whilst & while and amidst & amid   4 1  Australian English influences  Many New Zealand English terms have their origins in Australia  The most well known one is the use of the word mate to mean friend  or buddy  or simply person  as in  G day mate  how are ya   or  cheers  mate   Although it is originally an early British usage adopted and adapted in Australia  it is used in New Zealand exactly as in Australian usage  Maoris tend to use the word bro in the same way although this is no longer exclusively a Maori usage  Other Australian words that have become part of the New Zealand vocabulary are coo ee which was originally an aboriginal term meaning ‘to come’ and which has been used as an all purpose call to summon someone in for their lunch etc  It exists in NZE in the phrase  within coo ee  meaning ‘near’   Tall poppy  originated in Australia as a negatively loaded reference to someone who stood out from the crowd  e g  by being particularly bright or successful   It has been adopted and adapted in New Zealand  giving  tall poppyitis   a variant of  Tall Poppy Syndrome     tall poppy pruning   etc   as well as homegrown equivalents like  tall ponga   the ponga is a native tree fern   Other Australian terms common in NZE include bushed  lost or bewildered   chunder  to vomit   digger  soldier   dinkum  genuine or real   drongo  a foolish or stupid person   fossick  to search   jumbuck  sheep  from Australian pidgin   larrikin  mischievous person   Maccas  21st Century slang for McDonald s food   maimai  a duckshooter’s hide  originally a makeshift shelter  from aboriginal mia mia   muster  to round up sheep   station  for a large farm   pom or pommy  an Englishman   pub  hotel   shout  to buy a round of drinks   wowser  teetotaller   and ute  pickup truck    Where Australian English usually favours a British term over an American term  New Zealand English usually follows suit  Words such as allen key  bank holiday  bloke  boot  car   chemist  for American drugstore   hire purchase  kennel  railway  ring road  spring onion  taxi rank  windscreen are all British words shared in both Australian and New Zealand English   4 2  American English Influences  Advancing from its British and Australian English origins  New Zealand English has developed to include many Americanisms and American vocabulary in preference over British terms as well as directly borrowed American vocabulary  Some examples of American words used instead of British words in New Zealand English are muffler for the British silencer  truck for the British lorry  station wagon for the British estate car  stove over cooker  creek over brook  hope chest over bottom drawer  eggplant instead of aubergine  hardware store instead of ironmonger  median strip for central reservation  stroller for pushchair  pushup for press up  potato chip instead of potato crisp  license plate for registration plate  also Australia   corn instead of maize  cellphone or cell for British and Australian mobile phone and mobile  gasoline or gas for British and Australian petrol  although Australian influence is again popularizing petrol   and popsicle instead of British ice lolly  or Australian icy pole    Directly borrowed American vocabulary include bobby pin  hair pin   the boonies  boondocks   bucks  dollars   bushwhack  fell timber   butt  buttocks   replacing British Australian arse although arse can still be used   ding  dent   dude  guy  fellow   duplex  a type of dwelling   faggot and fag  a homosexual   replacing British poof and poofter   figure  to think or conclude  consider   homeboy  person from one s neighbourhood   hooker  prostitute   lagoon  expanse of shallow fresh water   lube  oil change   man  in place of mate or bro in direct address   major  to study or qualify in a subject   to be over  some situation   be fed up   reckon  to think or suppose   rig  large truck   sheltered workshop  workplace for disabled persons   spat  a small argument   subdivision  land divided into blocks or sections   and tavern  a place licensed for the sale and consumption of alcoholic drink   In recent times the American pronunciation of exit   eg zit  versus  ek sit   is preferred  New Zealand pronunciation of tuna is almost invariably  too na  and not  choo na  whereas in Australia the word is always said  choo na    4 3  New Zealand isms  In addition to word and phrase borrowings from Australian  British and American English  New Zealand has it s own unique words and phrases derived entirely in New Zealand  Some of these include   choice  adj or interj  excellent  good  Dairy  noun  a corner shop  convenience store  Superette  noun  a convenience store smaller than a supermarket but bigger than a corner store   chur  interj  contraction of  cheers  most common heard in  chur  bro    dear  adj  expensive  overpriced   fang it  phrase  to go fast   get your beans  phrase  get what s coming to you  be punished  give it a burl  phrase  to try  undertake an activity  handle  noun  A glass of beer  pint   Kiwi  adj  Not only does Kiwi mean  a New Zealand person  but it is sometimes used to replace the word New Zealand in NZ businesses or titles  such as KiwiRail and Kiwibank or New Zealand related nouns  eg   Kiwi ism   This practice may be seen by non New Zealanders as overly kitsch or cute   knackered  adv  tired  worn out   iwi  noun  Maori word for tribe   kai  noun  Food  from Maori   munted  adj  slang  a  destroyed  trashed  broken b  of a person  weird or odd  puckerood or pakaru  adj  broken  busted  wrecked   rattle

praise  souvenir  verb  to take without asking  steal  such as soap from a hotel or napkins from a restaurant  etc   skull  verb  to drink a glass of beer in one go   stoked  adv  very pleased  delighted   sweet as   interj  Cool  Awesome   Tiki Tour  noun  a guided tour  exploration   up the boohai  phrase  to be lost  stranded   wahini  noun  A woman  wife  from Maori    winner  noun   of a person  a total loser  write off   Yeah nah  acknowledgement  A reluctant  coy or hesitant  no    4 4  Differences from Australian English  Many of these relate to words used to refer to common items  often based on which major brands become eponyms   5  Usage  Some New Zealanders will often reply to a question with a statement spoken with a rising intonation at the end  This often has the effect of making their statement sound like another question  There is enough awareness of this that it is seen in exaggerated form in comedy parody of New Zealanders  This rising intonation can also be heard at the end of statements  which are not in response to a question but to which the speaker wishes to add emphasis  High rising terminals are also heard in Australia and are more common   In informal speech  some New Zealanders use the third person feminine she in place of the third person neuter it as the subject of a sentence  especially when the subject is the first word of the sentence  The most common use of this is in the phrase  She ll be right  meaning either  It will be okay  or  It is close enough to what is required   This is similar to Australian English   6  Māori influence  Many local everyday words have been borrowed from the Māori language  including words for local flora  fauna  place names and the natural environment   The dominant influence of Māori on New Zealand English is lexical  A 1999 estimate based on the Wellington corpora of written and spoken New Zealand English put the proportion of words of Māori origin at approximately 0 6%  mostly place and personal names   The everyday use of Maori words  usually colloquial  occurs most prominently among youth  young adults and Maori populations  Examples include words like kia ora   hello    or kai   food   which almost all New Zealanders know   Māori is ever present and has a significant conceptual influence in the legislature  government  and community agencies  e g  health and education   where legislation requires that proceedings and documents be translated into Māori  under certain circumstances  and when requested   Political discussion and analysis of issues of sovereignty  environmental management  health  and social well being thus rely on Māori at least in part  Māori as a spoken language is particularly important wherever community consultation occurs   6 1  Pronunciation of Māori place names  The pronunciations of many Māori place names were anglicised for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  but since the 1980s increased consciousness of the Māori language has led to a shift towards using a Māori pronunciation  The anglicisations have persisted most among residents of the towns in question  so it has become something of a shibboleth  with correct Māori pronunciation marking someone as non local   Some anglicised names are colloquially shortened  for example  Coke for Kohukohu  the Rapa for the Wairarapa  Kura for Papakura  Papatoe for Papatoetoe  Otahu for Otahuhu  Paraparam or Pram for Paraparaumu  the Naki for Taranaki  Cow cop for Kaukapakapa and Pie cock for Paekakariki   There is some confusion between these shortenings  especially in the southern South Island  and the natural variations of the southern dialect of Māori  Not only does this dialect sometimes feature apocope  but consonants also vary slightly from standard Māori  To compound matters  names were often initially transcribed by Scottish settlers  rather than the predominantly English settlers of other parts of the country  as such further alterations are not uncommon  Thus  while Lake Wakatipu is sometimes referred to as Wakatip  Oamaru as Om a roo  and Waiwera South as Wy vra  these differences may be as much caused by dialect differences – either in Māori or in the English used during transcription – as by laziness in anglicisation   7  Dialects  Recognisable regional variations are slight  with the exception of Southland  where the  Southland burr   see above  is heard  It is also common in the southern part of neighbouring Otago  This southern area formed a traditional repository of immigration from Scotland  see Dunedin   Several words and phrases common in Scots or Scottish English persist in this area  examples include the use of wee to mean  small   and phrases such as to do the messages meaning  to go shopping   Taranaki has also been said to have a minor regional accent  possibly due to the high number of immigrants from the South West of England  however this becoming less pronounced  Current research  2012  suggests that postvocalic  r  is not restricted to Southland  but is found also in the central North Island where there may be a Pasifika influence  but also a possible influence from modern New Zealand hip‐hop music  which has been shown to have high levels of non‐prevocalic  r  after the NURSE vowel   Other Southland features that have been identified and which may also relate to early Scottish settlement are the use of the TRAP vowel in a set of BATH words  dance  castle   which is also found in some Australia English regions and in the maintenance of the  ʍ  ~  w  distinction  so which and witch are not homophonous for such speakers    Some Māori have an accent distinct from the general New Zealand accent  tending to use Māori words more frequently  Bro Town was a TV programme that exaggerated Māori  Polynesian  and other accents  Linguists recognise two main New Zealand accents  denoted  Pākehā English  and  Māori English   with the latter strongly influenced by syllable timed Māori speech patterns  Pākehā English is beginning to adopt similar rhythms  distinguishing it from other stress timed English accents   8  Spelling  Where there is a difference between British and US spelling  such as cancelling canceling and jewellery jewelry   the British spelling of using double L is almost universally used although there are some specific words that always retain a single  l  as in enrol   New Zealand spelling of  re words such as centre  metre  litre  and theatre have always officially followed the British spelling as opposed to American center  meter  liter  and theater although in practice American spellings frequently appear in New Zealand texts  such as in Real Estate listings  buy and sell websites such as Trade Me  AutoTrader  and others    ce words such as defence  and licence are always spelled in the British way as opposed to American defense  and license   With  our words like colour color or behaviour behavior the spelling of  our is usually used unless a Trademark  such as Colorsteel or The Color Run  etc  Foreign official awards such as the FBI Medal Of Valor always retain their US spelling in New Zealand texts  Additionally the online version of the New Zealand Herald newspaper republishes articles with US spelling when the original article is written with US spelling  such as articles from the Associated Press  Since the advent of Word Processors with Spell checkers  in modern assignment writing in New Zealand universities the rule is to use either 100% British spelling or 100% American spelling  the emphasis being consistency  Informally  these rules are not followed exclusively as evidenced by the frequency of US spelling in New Zealand on line buy and sell websites  automobile sales sites  Real Estate sites  Business sites  etc   For words ending  ment as in judgment and argument etc  the American spelling is universally used in New Zealand as opposed to British judgement and arguement   The British spelling of aeroplane has fallen out of favour for the US spelling  airplane  Either can be used in NZ  In Britain and Australia airplane is also increasingly being used  Conversely  aeroplane is still sometimes used in French speaking areas of Canada   New Zealand English retains the distinctions between program   computer heuristic   and programme   schedule  broadcast show    disk   information storage device   and disc   flat circular object    and analog  as in analog stick  and analogue  all other senses  found in British and Australian English   It is acceptable to form past tenses and past participles of certain verbs with either the British  t or American  ed forms in New Zealand English  For example  learn becomes learnt or learned  spell becomes spelt or spelled  burn becomes burnt or burned  and dream becomes dreamt or dreamed     However in phrases such as burnt offering or as in the colour burnt sienna the word burnt is always spelled  t  These  t choices are pronounced with a final unvoiced sound  meaning spoilt is pronounced not unless spelled specifically  ed in which case it is accordingly pronounced   Learned  the adjective meaning  wise   is universally spelt thus and pronounced as two syllables  The past tense and past participle of earn is earned universally  though it may be pronounced ending with a sound   Words with the digraphs ae and oe in British English used to be predominantly spelled as such in New Zealand English  e g  foetus not fetus  and not with just e as in American English however over the last three decades the American spelling has become favoured  This has also occurred somewhat more recently in British English as well  Examples of this include encyclopaedia  old    encyclopedia  new   chamaeleon  old    chameleon  new   hyaena  old    hyena  new   and homoeopathy  old    homeopathy  All of these words are listed in the New Zealand Oxford English Dictionary with the accepted American New Zealand spelling listed first and the British spelling as an alternative   In New Zealand the spellings of ton and tons are commonly used  e g  I have tons of friends and I feel tons better   despite the metric system with its tonne having been introduced in the 1970s   In words that may be spelt with either an  ise or an  ize suffix  such as organise organize  New Zealand English  like Australian English  mainly prefers  ise  This contrasts with American English  where  ize is generally preferred  and British English  where  ise is also generally preferred but by some  including the Oxford Dictionary   ize is preferred  In New Zealand it is not wrong to use either spelling  In Australia  ize is unacceptable   New Zealand favours fiord over fjord  unlike most other English speaking countries  although fjord is not unseen   When spelling words with macrons borrowed from Maori  New Zealand English can either spell them with macrons or without  e g  Maori and Māori are both accepted spellings   In informal writing  macrons are not usually kept  New Zealand tends to spell these words with macrons more often than other countries and there is a growing tendency to do so   New Zealand uses jail exclusively over Australian and British gaol   The American spelling tire is almost equally used as the British spelling tyre   All abbreviations of title  position  marital status  middle name  etc are abbreviated without a period in New Zealand  Thus the abbreviation of Doctor is Dr  the abbreviation of Mister is Mr  and the W in George W Bush
