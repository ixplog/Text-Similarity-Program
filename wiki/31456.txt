A truck  United States  Canada  Australia  New Zealand  also called a lorry in the United Kingdom and Ireland  is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo  Trucks vary greatly in size  power  and configuration  with the smallest being mechanically similar to an automobile  Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful  and may be configured to mount specialized equipment  such as in the case of fire trucks and concrete mixers and suction excavators   Modern trucks are largely powered by diesel engines exclusively  although small to medium size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US  In the European Union  vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to are known as light commercial vehicles  and those over as large goods vehicles   1  History  The oldest truck was built in 1896 by Gottlieb Daimler  The first truck in the United States was built by Autocar in 1899 and was available with optional 5 or 8 horsepower motors   2  Terminology  2 1  Etymology  The word  truck  might come from a back formation of  truckle  with the meaning  small wheel    pulley   from Middle English trokell  in turn from Latin trochlea  Another explanation is that it comes from Latin trochus with the meaning of  iron hoop   In turn  both go back to Greek trokhos  τροχός  meaning  wheel  from trekhein  τρέχειν   to run    The first known usage of  truck  was in 1611 when it referred to the small strong wheels on ships  cannon carriages  In its extended usage it came to refer to carts for carrying heavy loads  a meaning known since 1771  With the meaning of  motor powered load carrier   it has been in usage since 1930  shortened from  motor truck   which dates back to 1916    Lorry  has a more uncertain origin  but probably has its roots in the rail transport industry  where the word is known to have been used in 1838 to refer to a type of truck  a freight car as in British usage  not a bogie as in the American   specifically a large flat wagon  It probably derives from the verb lurry  to pull  tug  of uncertain origin  With the meaning of  self propelled vehicle for carrying goods  it has been in usage since 1911   Before that  the word  lorry  was used for a sort of big horse drawn goods wagon   2 2  International variance  In the United States  Canada  and the Philippines  truck  is usually reserved for commercial vehicles larger than normal cars  and includes pickups and other vehicles having an open load bed  In Australia  New Zealand and South Africa  the word  truck  is mostly reserved for larger vehicles  in Australia and New Zealand  a pickup truck is usually called a ute  short for  utility    while in South Africa it is called a bakkie  Afrikaans   small open container    In the United Kingdom  India  Malaysia  Singapore  Ireland and Hong Kong lorry is used instead of truck  but only for the medium and heavy types   In American English  the word  truck  is often preceded by a word describing the type of vehicle  such as a  tanker truck   In British English these would be referred to as a  tanker  or  petrol tanker    In Australia and New Zealand  the term ute  short for coupé utility  is used to describe a pickup truck with an open cargo carrying space but a front similar to a passenger car  and which requires only a passenger car licence to drive  The concept was developed in 1933 by Lewis Bandt of the Ford Motor Company in Geelong following a request from a Gippsland farmer s wife for a vehicle that they could go to church in on Sunday without getting wet and also use to take the pigs to market on Monday   3  Driving  In the United States  a commercial driver s license is required to drive any type of commercial vehicle weighing or more   The United Kingdom and the rest of Europe now have common  yet complex rules  see European driving licence   As an overview  to drive a vehicle weighing more than for commercial purposes requires a specialist licence  the type varies depending on the use of the vehicle and number of seats   For licences first acquired after 1997  that weight was reduced to   not including trailers   In Australia  a truck driver s license is required for any motor vehicle with a Gross Vehicle Mass  GVM  exceeding   The motor vehicles classes are further expanded as   LR  Light rigid  a rigid vehicle with a GVM of more than but not more than   Any towed trailer must not weigh more than GVM   MR  Medium rigid  a rigid vehicle with 2 axles and a GVM of more than   Any towed trailer must not weigh more than GVM  Also includes vehicles in class LR   HR  Heavy Rigid  a rigid vehicle with three or more axles and a GVM of more than    Any towed trailer must not weigh more than   GVM  Also includes articulated buses and vehicles in class MR   HC  Heavy Combination  a typical prime mover plus semi trailer combination   MC  Multi Combination e g   B Doubles road trains  There is also a heavy vehicle transmission condition for a license class HR  HC  or MC test passed in a vehicle fitted with an automatic or synchromesh transmission  a driver’s license will be restricted to vehicles of that class fitted with a synchromesh or automatic transmission  To have the condition removed  a person needs to pass a practical driving test in a vehicle with non synchromesh transmission  constant mesh or crash box    In 2006 the US trucking industry employed 1 8 million drivers of heavy trucks  There are around 5 million truck drivers in India   4  Anatomy  Almost all trucks share a common construction  they are made of a chassis  a cab  an area for placing cargo or equipment  axles  suspension and roadwheels  an engine and a drivetrain  Pneumatic  hydraulic  water  and electrical systems may also be present  Many also tow one or more trailers or semi trailers   4 1  Cab  The cab is an enclosed space where the driver is seated  A  sleeper  is a compartment attached to the cab where the driver can rest while not driving  sometimes seen in semi trailer trucks   There are several possible cab configurations    Cab over engine   COE  or  flat nose   where the driver is seated above the front axle and the engine  This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe  where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated  but also widely used in the rest of the world as well  They were common in North America  but lost prominence when permitted length was extended in the early 1980s  To reach the engine  the whole cab tilts forward  earning this design the name of  tilt cab   This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient paths and trackways which require the additional turning capability given by the short wheelbase of the cab over engine type  The COE design was invented by Viktor Schreckengost   Conventional cabs are the most common in North America and Australia  and are known in the UK as  American cabs  and in the Netherlands as  torpedo cabs   The driver is seated behind the engine  as in most passenger cars or pickup trucks  Conventionals are further divided into large car and aerodynamic designs  A  large car  or  long nose  is a conventional truck with a long   or more  hood   Aerodynamic  cabs are very streamlined  with a sloped hood and other features to lower drag   Cab beside engine designs also exist  but are rather rare and are mainly used inside shipping yards  or other specialist uses that require the vehicle to carry long loads such as pipes  metal rods  flat iron and other construction materials  This type is often custom made from a regular cabover truck that gets the upper half of its cab removed on the passenger side and replaced by an extended section of the bed  A further step from this is the side loading forklift that can be described as a specially fabricated vehicle with the same properties as a truck of this type  in addition to the ability to pick up its own load   4 2  Engine  Most small trucks such as sport utility vehicles  SUVs  or pickups  and even light medium duty trucks in North America and Russia will use gasoline engines  petrol engines   but many diesel engined models are now being produced  Most of the heavier trucks use four stroke diesel engine with a turbocharger and aftercooler  Huge off highway trucks use locomotive type engines such as a V12 Detroit Diesel two stroke engine  Diesel engines are becoming the engine of choice for trucks ranging from class 3 to 8 GVWs  A large proportion of refuse trucks in the United States employ CNG  compressed natural gas  engines for their low fuel cost and reduced carbon emissions   North American manufactured highway trucks often use an engine built by a third party  such as CAT  Cummins  or Detroit Diesel  but both Mack and Navistar offer their own engines   In the European Union  all new truck engines must comply with Euro 5 emission regulations   4 3  Drivetrain  Small trucks use the same type of transmissions as almost all cars  having either an automatic transmission or a manual transmission with synchromesh  synchronizers   Bigger trucks often use manual transmissions without synchronizers  saving bulk and weight  although synchromesh transmissions are used in larger trucks as well  Transmissions without synchronizers  known as  crash boxes   require double clutching for each shift   which can lead to repetitive motion injuries   or a technique known colloquially as  floating   a method of changing gears which doesn t use the clutch  except for starts and stops  due to the physical effort of double clutching  especially with non power assisted clutches  faster shifts  and less clutch wear   Double clutching allows the driver to control the engine and transmission revolutions to synchronize  so that a smooth shift can be made  for example  when upshifting  the accelerator pedal is released and the clutch pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral  the clutch pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear  Finally  the clutch pedal is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain required engine speed  Although this is a relatively fast movement  perhaps a second or so while transmission is in neutral  it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed  Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion  except the engine speed is now required to increase  while transmission is in neutral  just the right amount in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth  non collision gear change   Skip changing  is also widely used  in principle operation is the same as double clutching  but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single gear change   Common North American setups include 9  10  13  15  and 18 speeds  Automatic and semi automatic transmissions for heavy trucks are becoming more and more common  due to advances both in transmission and engine power  In Europe  8  10  12 and 16 gears are common on larger trucks with manual transmission  while automatic or semi automatic transmissions would have anything from 5 to 12 gears  Almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the  range and split   double H shift pattern  type  where range change and so‑called half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection   4 4  Frame  A truck frame consists of two parallel boxed  tubular  or C‑shaped rails  or beams  held together by crossmembers  These frames are referred to as ladder frames due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end  The rails consist of a tall vertical section  two if boxed  and two shorter horizontal flanges  The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied to the top of the frame  beam resistance   Though typically flat the whole length on heavy duty trucks  the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles  The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses  or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop   The frame is almost always made of steel  but can be made  whole or in part  of aluminum for a lighter weight  A tow bar may be found attached at one or both ends  but heavy trucks almost always make use of a fifth wheel hitch   5  Environmental effects  Trucks contribute to air  noise  and water pollution similarly to automobiles  Trucks may emit lower air pollution emissions than cars per equivalent vehicle mass  although the absolute level per vehicle distance traveled is higher  and diesel particulate matter is especially problematic for health  With respect to noise pollution  trucks emit considerably higher sound levels at all speeds compared to typical car  this contrast is particularly strong with heavy duty trucks  There are several aspects of truck operations that contribute to the overall sound that is emitted  Continuous sounds are those from tires rolling on the roadway  and the constant hum of their diesel engines at highway speeds  Less frequent noises  but perhaps more noticeable  are things like the repeated sharp pitched whistle of a turbocharger on acceleration  or the abrupt blare of an exhaust brake retarder when traversing a downgrade  There has been noise regulation put in place to help control where and when the use of engine braking retarders are allowed   Concerns have been raised about the effect of trucking on the environment  particularly as part of the debate on global warming  In the period from 1990 to 2003  carbon dioxide emissions from transportation sources increased by 20%  despite improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency  In 2005  transportation accounted for 27% of U S  greenhouse gas emission  increasing faster than any other sector   Between 1985 and 2004  in the U S   energy consumption in freight transportation grew nearly 53%  while the number of ton miles carried increased only 43%   According to a 1995 U S  government estimate  the energy cost of carrying one ton of freight a distance of one kilometer averages 337 kJ for water  221 kJ for rail  2 000 kJ for trucks  and nearly 13 000 kJ for air transport  Many environmental organizations favor laws and incentives to encourage the switch from road to rail  especially in Europe   The European Parliament is moving to ensure that charges on heavy goods vehicles should be based in part on the air and noise pollution they produce and the congestion they cause  according to legislation approved by the Transport Committee  The Eurovignette scheme has been proposed  whereby new charges would be potentially levied against things such as noise and air pollution and also weight related damages from the lorries themselves   6  Sales and sales issues  6 1  Truck market worldwide  Largest truck

truck from damage or injuries to other people as a result of a truck accident  This truck insurance coverage is mandated by U S  state and federal agencies  and proof of coverage is required to be sent to them  Interstate trucks in the U S  are required to have a minimum of $75 000 in liability insurance  This includes motor carriers operating vehicles with a gross weight rating in excess of 10 000 lbs  which transport non hazardous materials   All motor carriers operating vehicles transporting materials classified as hazardous  and which have a gross weight rating in excess of 10 000 lbs must have a minimum of $1 000 000 in liability insurance  All motor carriers operating vehicles such as tanks or hopper type cargo vehicles with a capacity in excess of 3 500 water gallons must have a minimum of $5 000 000 in liability insurance  Pricing is dependent on region  driving records  and history of the trucking operation   Motor truck cargo insurance protects the transporter for his responsibility in the event of damaged or lost freight  The policy is purchased with a maximum load limit per vehicle  Cargo insurance coverage limits can range from $10 000 to $100 000 or more  Pricing for this insurance is mainly dependent on the type of cargo being hauled   7 2  Trucking accidents  In 2002 and 2004  there were over 5 000 fatalities related to trucking accidents in the United States  The trucking industry has since made significant efforts in increasing safety regulations  In 2008 the industry had successfully lowered the fatality rate to just over 4 000 deaths  But trucking accidents are still an issue that causes thousands of deaths and injuries each year  Approximately 6 000 trucking accident fatalities occur annually in the United States  Fatalities are not the only issue caused by trucking accidents  Here are some of the environmental issues that arise with trucking accidents   14 4% of trucking accidents cause cargo to spill  6 5% cause open flames The USDOT 2009 Large Trucks in Fatal Crashes with Passenger Vehicles with Driver Related Factors figures show that in 22% of crashes the large truck driver was a factor  while 80 5% of passenger vehicle drivers were  Alcohol or other drugs among heavy truck drivers were a factor in  31% of crashes  among passenger vehicle drivers they were a factor in 11 75% of crashes   8  Truck shows  In the UK
