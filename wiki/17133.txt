In an archipelago like the Hawaiian Islands the water between islands is typically called a channel or passage  Described here are the channels between the islands of Hawaii  arranged from southeast to northwest   1  Alenuihāhā Channel  The Alenuihāhā separates the island of Hawaii and the island of Maui  The maximum depth of this channel is 6100 feet  1900 m   and the channel is 30 miles wide  There is a significant wind funnel effect in the channel  which is subject to scientific investigations   2  Alalākeiki Channel  The Alalākeiki Channel separates the islands of Kahoolawe and Maui  at a distance of 7 miles  Alalākeiki means  crying baby    3  Kealaikahiki Channel  Ke ala i kahiki channel is the channel between Lānai and Kahoolawe  It literally means  the road to Tahiti   if one takes a bearing off of Kealaikahiki Point on Kahoolawe while in the channel and heads directly straight  one arrives  more or less  in Tahiti  In practice  however  Polynesian navigators probably did not quite ply a straight route to Tahiti  The channel is 17 miles wide   4  Auau Channel  The Auau Channel is one of the most protected areas of ocean in the Hawaiian Islands  lying between Lānai and Maui  The channel is also protected by Molokai to the north  and Kahoolawe to the south  The depth of the channel reaches 108 feet  33 m   and its width is 8 8 miles  Auau channel is a whale watching center in the Hawaiian Islands  Humpback whales migrate approximately 3 500 miles  5600 km  from Alaskan waters each autumn and spend the northern hemisphere winter months in the protected waters of the channel   Auau translates to  to take a bath  referring to its calm bath like conditions   4 1  Lahaina Roads  The middle of the Auau channel off Lahaina is known as the Lahaina Roads  Once filled with whalers when Lahaina was a capital for that industry  Lahaina Roads were later adopted as an alternate anchorage for the main U S  Pacific Fleet based at Pearl Harbor  In the planning for the attack on Pearl Harbor  the Japanese had hoped that the Pacific Fleet still utilized Lahaina as an anchorage as ships sunk in the deep water there would have been unrecoverable  However  Lahaina was not utilized  and the bulk of the fleet remained moored in Pearl Harbor  The Roads are still a common moorage for oceangoing cruise ships and naval vessels of many flags  including the U S   whose crews enjoy liberty on the island   5  Pailolo Channel  The Pailolo Channel separates the islands of Molokai and Maui  Although the channel is only about 8 4 miles at its shortest point  it is one of the windiest and roughest in the Hawaiian Islands   Pailolo translates to  crazy fisherman  referring to the typical sea surface conditions and who would attempt to navigate therein   6  Kalohi Channel  The Kalohi Channel is the stretch of water separating Lānai and Molokai  Depth of water in this channel is about 260 feet  79 m  and width is 9 3 miles  This is one of the less treacherous channels between islands in the archipelago  although strong winds and choppy sea conditions are frequent  Kalolohia beach on the Lānai coast is also known as  Shipwreck Beach  because of a wreck on the reef there   7  Kaiwi Channel  The Kaiwi Channel  also known as the Molokai Channel  separates the islands of Oahu and Molokai  and is 26 miles wide  Maximum depth is 2300 feet  701 m   There are annual paddleboarding and outrigger canoe paddling contests which traverse this channel   8  Kaulakahi Channel  The Kaulakahi Channel separates the islands of Niihau and Kauai  It is 17 miles wide   9  Kaie Waho Channel  The Kaie Waho Channel separates the islands of Kauai and Oahu  at a distance of 72 miles   10  References
