Reykjavík      is the capital and largest city of Iceland  Its latitude  at 64°08  N  makes it the world s northernmost capital of a sovereign state and a popular tourist destination  It is located in southwestern Iceland  on the southern shore of the Faxaflói Bay  With a population of around 120 000  and over 200 000 in the Capital Region   it is the heart of Iceland s cultural  economic and governmental activity   Reykjavík is believed to be the location of the first permanent settlement in Iceland  which Ingólfur Arnarson is said to have established around AD 870  Until the 18th century  there was no urban development in the city location  The city was founded in 1786 as an official trading town and grew steadily over the next decades  as it transformed into a regional and later national center of commerce  population  and governmental activities  It is among the cleanest  greenest  and safest cities in the world   1  History  The first permanent settlement in Iceland by Norsemen is believed to have been established in Reykjavík by Ingólfur Arnarson from Norway around AD 870  this is described in Landnámabók  or the Book of Settlement  Ingólfur Arnarson is said to have decided the location of his settlement using a traditional Viking method  he cast his high seat pillars  Öndvegissúlur  into the ocean when he saw the coastline  then settled where the pillars came to shore  Steam from hot springs in the region is said to have inspired Reykjavík s name  which loosely translates to Smoke Cove  the city is often referred to as the Bay of Smokes or Bay of Smoke  The original name was Reykjarvík with an additional  r  that vanished around 1300   Reykjavík is not mentioned in any medieval sources except as farmland  but the 18th century saw the beginning of urban concentration there  The Danish rulers of Iceland backed the idea of domestic industry in Iceland that would stimulate much needed progress on the island  In 1752  the King of Denmark  Frederik V  donated the estate of Reykjavík to the Innréttingar Corporation  the name comes from Danish indretninger  meaning institution  The leader of this movement was Skúli Magnússon  In the 1750s several houses were built to house the wool industry that was to be Reykjavík s most important employer for a few decades and the original reason for its existence  Other crafts were also practised by the Innréttingar  such as fisheries  sulphur mining  agriculture  and shipbuilding   The Danish Crown abolished monopoly trading in 1786 and granted six communities around the country an exclusive trading charter  Reykjavík was one of them and the only one to hold on to the charter permanently  The year 1786 is regarded as the date of the city s founding  its 200th anniversary was celebrated in 1986  Trading rights were still limited to the subjects of the Danish Crown  and Danish traders continued to dominate trade in Iceland  Over the following decades  their business in Iceland expanded  After 1880  free trade was expanded to all nationalities and the influence of Icelandic merchants started to grow   1 1  Rise of nationalism  Icelandic nationalist sentiment gained influence in the 19th century and the idea of Icelandic independence became widespread  Reykjavík  as Iceland s only city  was the melting pot of such ideas  Advocates of an independent Iceland realized that a strong Reykjavík was fundamental to that objective  All the important events in the history of the independence struggle are important for Reykjavík as well  In 1845  Alþingi  the general assembly formed in AD 930  was re established in Reykjavík  it had been suspended a few decades earlier when it was located at Þingvellir  At the time it functioned only as an advisory assembly  advising the King about Icelandic affairs  The location of Alþingi in Reykjavík effectively established the city as the capital of Iceland   In 1874 Iceland was given a constitution  with it  Alþingi gained some limited legislative powers and in essence became the institution that it is today  The next step was to move most of the executive power to Iceland  Home Rule was granted in 1904 when the office of minister for Iceland was established in Reykjavík  The biggest step towards an independent Iceland was taken on 1 December 1918 when Iceland became a sovereign country under the Crown of Denmark  the Kingdom of Iceland   In the 1920s and 1930s most of the growing Icelandic fishing trawler fleet sailed from Reykjavík and salt cod production was the main industry  but the Great Depression hit Reykjavík hard with unemployment and labour union struggles that sometimes became violent   1 2  World War II  On the morning of 10 May 1940  following the German occupation of Denmark and Norway on 9 April 1940  four British warships approached Reykjavík and anchored in the harbour  In a few hours  the allied occupation of Reykjavík was complete  There was no armed resistance  and taxi and truck drivers even assisted the invasion force  which initially had no motor vehicles   The Icelandic government had received many requests from the British government to consent to the occupation  but it always declined on the basis of the Neutrality Policy  For the remaining years of World War II  British and later American soldiers occupied camps in Reykjavík  and the number of foreign soldiers in Reykjavík became about the same as the local population of the town  The Royal Regiment of Canada  RREGTC  formed part of the garrison in Iceland during the early part of the war   The economic effects of the occupation were positive for Reykjavík  the unemployment of the depression years vanished and construction work began  The British built Reykjavík Airport  which is still in service today  mostly serving domestic flights  The Americans  meanwhile  built Keflavík Airport  situated west of Reykjavík  which would become Iceland s primary international airport  In 1944 the Republic of Iceland was founded and a president  elected by the people  replaced the King  the office of the president was placed in Reykjavík   1 3  Post war development  In the post war years the growth of Reykjavík accelerated  A mass exodus from the rural countryside began  largely due to improved technology in agriculture that reduced the need for manpower  and because of the population boom resulting from better living conditions in the country  A once primitive village was rapidly transformed into a modern city  Private cars became common and modern apartment complexes rose in the expanding suburbs  Much of Reykjavík lost its village feel  In 1972  Reykjavík hosted the world chess championship between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky   Reykjavík has in the last three decades become a significant player in the global community  The 1986 Reykjavík Summit between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev underlined Reykjavík s new found international status  Deregulation in the financial sector and the computer revolution of the 1990s again transformed Reykjavík  The financial sector and information technology are now significant employers in the city  The city has fostered some world famous talents in recent years  such as Björk  Ólafur Arnalds and bands Múm  Sigur Rós  and Of Monsters and Men  and poet Sjón   2  Geography  Reykjavík is located in southwest Iceland  The Reykjavík area coastline is characterized by peninsulas  coves  straits  and islands   During the Ice Age  up to 10 000 years ago  a large glacier covered parts of the city area  reaching as far out as Álftanes  Other parts of the city area were covered by sea water  In the warm periods and at the end of the Ice Age  some hills like Öskjuhlíð were islands  The former sea level is indicated by sediments  with clams  reaching  at Öskjuhlíð  for example  as far as above the current sea level  The hills of Öskjuhlíð and Skólavörðuholt appear to be the remains of former shield volcanoes which were active during the warm periods of the Ice Age   After the Ice Age  the land rose as the heavy load of the glaciers fell away  and began to look as it does today   The capital city area continued to be shaped by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions  like the one 4 500 years ago in the mountain range Bláfjöll  when the lava coming down the Elliðaá valley reached the sea at the bay of Elliðavogur   The largest river to run through Reykjavík is the Elliðaá River  which is non navigable  It is one of the best salmon fishing rivers in the country  Mount Esja  at   is the highest mountain in the vicinity of Reykjavík   The city of Reykjavík is mostly located on the Seltjarnarnes peninsula  but the suburbs reach far out to the south and east  Reykjavík is a spread out city  most of its urban area consists of low density suburbs  and houses are usually widely spaced  The outer residential neighbourhoods are also widely spaced from each other  in between them are the main traffic arteries and a lot of empty space   2 1  Climate  Temperatures very rarely drop below in the winter  This is because the Icelandic coastal weather in winter is moderated by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream  The climate is subpolar oceanic  Koppen  Cfc      and the city is on the northern edge of the temperate zone  The city s coastal location does make it prone to wind  however  and gales are common in winter  Summers are cool  with temperatures fluctuating between   sometimes exceeding   Reykjavík is not a particularly wet city  but it nevertheless averages 148 days with measurable precipitation every year  Droughts are uncommon although they occur in some summers  In the summer of 2007  no rain was measured for one month  Spring tends to be the sunniest season  May particularly  Annual sunshine hours in Reykjavík are around 1 300  which is comparable with other places in Northern and North Eastern Europe  such as Glasgow  Scotland  The highest ever recorded temperature in Reykjavík was   recorded on 30 July 2008  while the lowest ever recorded temperature was   recorded on 21 January 1918  The temperature has not dropped to below since 30 January 1971   3  Cityscape  File

18 domiciled in the city  The council has 15 members who are elected using the open list method for 4 year terms   The council selects members of boards  and each board controls a different field under the city council s authority  The most important board is the City Board that wields the executive rights along with the City Mayor  The City Mayor is the senior public official and also the director of city operations  Other public officials control city institutions under the mayor s authority  Thus the administration consists of two different parts   The political power of City Council cascading down to other boards  Public officials under the authority of the city mayor who administer and manage implementation of policy   4 1  Political control  The Independence Party had overall control of the city council from the party s establishment in 1929 until 1978  when they narrowly lost their overall majority  From 1978 to 1982 the People s Alliance  the Social Democratic Party and the Progressive Party formed the majority of the council  The Independence Party regained overall control in the 1982 elections  and held it until 1994  At that election its opponents had formed an alliance  called Reykjavíkurlistinn  or the R list  That alliance had overall control until 2006  In the May 2006 elections the electorate could choose between five different parties  three of which had formed the R list  The Independence Party obtained 7 members of the council  and thus failed to gain overall control  but together with the Progressive Party  and its one council member  they were able to form a new majority in the council which took over in June 2006  In October 2007 a new majority was formed on the council  consisting of members of the Progressive Party  1   the Social Democratic Alliance  4   the Left Greens  2  and the F list  1   liberals and independents   after controversy regarding REI  a subsidiary of OR  the city s energy company  However three months later the leader of the F list formed a new majority together with the Independence Party  Ólafur F  Magnússon  the leader of the F list  was elected mayor on 24 January 2008  and in March 2009 the Independence Party was due to appoint a new mayor  This changed once again on 14 August 2008 when the fourth majority of the season was formed  when the Independence Party and the Progressive party took over again  with Hanna Birna Kristjánsdóttir becoming mayor  The latest election in May 2010 saw a new political party  The Best Party  win the most seats on the council   4 2  Mayor  The mayor is appointed by the city council  usually one of the council members is chosen but they may also appoint a mayor who is not a member of the council   The post was created in 1907 and advertised in 1908  Two applications were received  from Páll Einarsson  sheriff and town mayor of Hafnarfjörður and from Knud Zimsen  town councillor in Reykjavík  Páll was appointed on 7 May and was mayor for six years  At that time the city mayor received a salary of 4500 ISK per year and 1500 ISK for office expenses  The current mayor is Dagur B  Eggertsson   4 3  Latest election  5  Demographics  Reykjavík

economic growth and subsequent economic contraction over the last decade  a period referred to in foreign media as the  Nordic Tiger  years  or  Iceland s Boom Years   The economic boom led to a sharp increase in construction  with large redevelopment projects such as Harpa concert hall and conference centre and others   In 2009  Reykjavík was listed as the richest city in the world in 2007 by The

among the highest in the world at roughly 522 vehicles per 1 000 residents  though Reykjavík is not severely affected by congestion  Several multi lane highways  mainly dual carriageways  run between the most heavily populated areas and most frequently driven routes  Parking spaces are also plentiful in most areas  Public transportation consists of a bus system called Strætó bs  Route 1  the Ring Road  runs through the city outskirts and connects the city to the rest of Iceland   7 2  Airports and seaports  Reykjavík Airport  the second largest airport in the country  after Keflavík International Airport   is positioned inside the city  just south of the city centre  It is mainly used for domestic flights  as well as flights to Greenland and the Faroe Islands  It was built there by the British occupation force during World War II  when it was on the outskirts of the then much smaller Reykjavík  Since 1962 there has been some controversy regarding the location of the airport  since it takes up a lot of valuable space in central Reykjavík   Reykjavík has two seaports  the old harbour near the city centre which is mainly used by fishermen and cruise ships and Sundahöfn in the east city which is the largest cargo port in the country   7 3  Railways  There are no public railways in Iceland  due to its sparse population  but the locomotives used to build the docks are on display   7 4  District heating  Volcanic activity provides Reykjavík with geothermal heating systems for both residential and industrial districts  In 2008  natural hot water was used to heat roughly 90% of all buildings in Iceland  Of total annual use of geothermal energy of 39 PJ  space heating accounted for 48%   Most of the district heating in Iceland comes from three main geothermal power plants   Svartsengi combined heat and power plant  CHP   Nesjavellir CHP plant  Hellisheiði CHP plant  8  Cultural heritage  The  Culture House  was opened in 1909 and has a number of important exhibits  Originally built for to house the National Library and National Archives and also previously the location of the National Museum and Natural History Museum  in 2000 it was re modelled to promote the Icelandic national heritage  Many of Iceland s national treasures are on display  such as the Poetic Edda  and the Sagas  in their original manuscripts  There are also changing exhibitions on various topics   9  Lifestyle  9 1  Nightlife  Reykjavík is famous for its weekend nightlife  Icelanders tend to go out late  so bars that look rather quiet can fill up suddenly—usually after midnight on a weekend   Alcohol is relatively expensive at bars  People tend to drink at home before going out  Beer was banned in Iceland until 1 March 1989  but has since become popular among many Icelanders as their alcoholic drink of choice   There are over 100 different bars and clubs in Reykjavík  most of them are located on Laugavegur and its side streets  It is very common for an establishment that is a café before dinner to turn into a bar in the evening  Closing time is usually around 4 30 am at weekends and 1 am during the week  The Iceland Airwaves music festival is annually staged in October   9 2  New Year s Eve  The arrival of the new year is a particular cause for celebration to the people of Reykjavík  Icelandic law states that anyone may purchase and use
