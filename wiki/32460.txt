The main roles of the National Armed Forces of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana  FANB  are to defend the sovereign national territory of Venezuela  fight against drug trafficking  to provide search and rescue capabilities and in case of natural disasters protection and aid to the civilian population    the armed forces have 113 558 personnel   1  History of the Armed Forces of Venezuela  The origin of an organized and professional armed forces in Venezuela dates to the Spanish troops quartered in the former Province of Venezuela in the 18th century  Politically and militarily until the creation of the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777  the Province of Venezuela depended on the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo  in today s Dominican Republic  or the Viceroyalty of New Granada  today  Colombia  for the defense of the area  In 1732 the Spanish crown created a Military Directorate and established a number of battalions  and had a few units from infantry regiments based in Spain arrive in the area  Reform of the military in the colonies began a few decades later  The first squadrons of cavalry arrived from Spain in 1751  The first batteries of Artillery were officially raised just two years later  Both Creole whites and blacks were allowed to enter the ranks of the artillery companies  That same year  a Fixed Caracas Battalion was established  Until the creation of this battalion  defense had been based on small colonial militia companies  which initially only accepted whites  Gradually  this racist policy yielded and the entry of mixed race people was allowed in the militias  It was from these various units that the bulk of the officers who fought in the battles of the Venezuelan War of Independence emerged  Among them were Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda  Simón Bolívar  Bolívar s own father had been Colonel of the Militia of Aragua   General in chief Santiago Mariño  Rafael Urdaneta  among many other heroes  With the establishment of an independent captaincy general in the latter half of the 18th century  the Spanish troops quartered in the province passed to the direct command of Caracas  The troops in the other provinces of the country  under the command of local governors  were overseen by the Captain General of Caracas  who served as commander in chief of the armed services  In this way a series of autonomous units was created for the peoples of the area and for defense duties  open to all fit males regardless of color  Aside from these the Spanish Navy also operated naval bases in the Captaincy General s territorial coastline  open to both whites and blacks as well   Already in the early 19th century  many of these Venezuelans who had formed the bulk of the officer corps at the start of the formation of the national armed forces began to arrive in the country after participating in military campaigns abroad in the American Revolutionary War  the French Revolution  or after completing their studies in Europe  With them came a number of mercenaries and volunteers of many different nationalities  English  Scottish  Irish  French  German  Brazilian  Poles  Russians  and others  It was only in 1810 in the aftermath of the coup d état of April 19 that year that formally began the process of raising the national armed services  Several of the military officers of the colonial military forces supported the coup and the subsequent creation of a junta  That Supreme Junta later appointed Commander Lino de Clemente to be in charge of defense affairs for the Captaincy General  and thus the armed forces began to be formed through their efforts  including the opening of a full military academy in Caracas for the training of officers  later joined by a naval academy in La Guaira for naval officer education the following year   It could be said that in the first two decades of the 19th century  the nascent Liberation Army and Navy  was in the midst of the intellectual training of their military cadres  in various attempts to unleash the revolutionary war  and trying to build a modern army and navy  In the midst of that task came the generalissimo Francisco de Miranda  and the Liberator Simón Bolívar  who called for immediate action to  once and for all  ensure the independence of the nation  achieved through the aformationed April 19 coup of 1810 and later through the formal enactment of the 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence  Bolívar surprised his military colleagues  when he rejected part of the Napoleonic military assumptions  habits and behaviors  took more British soldiers and those from other nations  and even through third parties requested the assistance of the British Crown for the formation of the regular army and navy for the growing republic  And he did made no mistake indeed  the 19th century  ultimately  was dominated by British and Prussian military influences  Once in battle  Bolívar began to develop his own tactics  military strategies and practices  whose legacy remains till this day in the National Armed Forces  and led to victory after victory and the full liberation of not just Venezuela  but of northern South America  through battles in both land and sea until the wars ended in 1824   1 1  National period  During the second half of the 19th century  a school for officers continued  Military Academy of Mathematics  which was decades in advance of the policy of unification of arms and services of the Spanish military academy  which was in fact after to the Venezuelan one   a standing Army  weapons  and creating new services including the Corps of Sappers  This phase of the Venezuelan Army  is marked by infighting and a domain of local militias with no training  the Federal War was one example   The little outside help in military matters at this stage is limited to the British and the later Chilean military missions  which began the long modernization of the army and navy  The military figures  there were other political figures  of the armed forces who were the most important at this stage were Marshal Juan Crisóstomo Falcón  General in Chief Cipriano Castro  Brigadier General Ezequiel Zamora and Manuel Ezequiel Bruzual   Already in the first half of the 20th century  President General in Chief Juan Vicente Gómez  who originally based on the plans of General in Chief Cipriano Castro  began a thorough modernization in the armed services  but does not create a new army as some historians point out  This modernization was done with the help of instructors and advisers from Chile  France  Italy and Germany  Interestingly  the late Prussian influence  did not reach the Venezuelan Army from the Germans  but from the Chilean military instructors in 1910  One of the most important reforms undertaken during the Gómez regime of the National Armed Forces  which began in 1910 with the aim of making the national armed services uniform  modern and technically advanced in this era of the 20th century   The reform coincided with the centennial anniversary of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence  which contributed to the doctrinal and political cohesion of the army and the navy  The most important milestones of this reform were   In 1910  operation of the Military Academy of Venezuela that was reformed in 1903 started  and within it  the Nautical School  then called Naval School of Venezuela   establishing the School of Application for Military officers in active service with the aim of upgrading their military expertise  In 1913 the Superior Technical Office responsible for the development of military doctrine  organization and training of the army  was founded   In 1920 the Military Aviation School of Venezuela was established  It was located in Maracay and was inaugurated the first of January of the next year to train the nation s military pilots   In 1923 1930 a new Code of Military law was adopted that superseded all previous military laws and responded to the new political and military situation in the country  This process was accompanied by the modernization of the infrastructure  provision of arms  equipment  uniforms and a sustained growth of the military budget  which was made possible by oil revenues  The reform had a strong German influence  This is due mainly to the fact the Prussian German army was the most modern of the era and in this sense become a model internationally   The most important political consequence of this reform was the military defeat and political leadership  converted in 1913 after anti gomecism  Since 1914 Gomez always retained the post of commander in chief of the Army  even when not holding the presidency of the Republic  The power base of support of the regime after 1913  apart from the yellow liberals and nationalists  was the armed forces  which became an essential element of repression to ensure public order and national progress   At this stage the military and political figures more relevant  apart from the general Gómez himself   were General in Chief Eleazar López Contreras  who founded the National Guard in 1937  and Divisional General Isaías Medina Angarita  both Presidents of the Republic   The second half of the 20th century  was just as turbulent for the Army  but it was projected into the future as a modern force  though not yet cohesive  Already under the government of Divisional General Marcos Pérez Jiménez  who led the country in the late 1940s and the early 1950s  the American influence  cultural  political and military  became more prominent then in the entire history of the armed forces  So jealous of the Venezuelan Army  over the subsequent decades  he kept a precarious existing French influence  as a balance to the overwhelming American influence in the armed forces  Between the years 1945 and 1952  there was a major program of military equipment purchases almost monopolized by the United States  although other military material was acquired from other sources  plus the military missions sent by that country  And again in the early years of the decade of the 70s  albeit in a more balanced way by their countries of origin   The 70s were also marked with the Carabobo Reorganizational Plan  aimed to enhance the capability of the Army and marked an increase of regular army units and materiel  The Air Force  Navy and National Guard increased their capabilities as well with modern equipment to satisfy all those who serve   Born again under a turbulent internal and external picture for the nation is the modern National Bolivarian Armed Forces  in the midst of the economic crises of the 1980s and the subsequent military coups of the early 1990s  But in a relatively short time it has undergone significant changes  including its name  from National Armed Forces to National Bolivarian Armed Forces  to its doctrines  switching from a non political position to one that defends socialism and the Bolivarian revolution itself on its own  This change has been clearly visible by the switchover of partners and suppliers from 1999  the year that marked the end of a long standing cooperation between the National Armed Forces  the US and its allies  to a new system of  multilateral alliances  with the Russian Federation as the biggest of those new military allies   Today the NBAF stands prous of its long history and heritage and is committed to contribute to total national defense and development as the oldest active armed forces in South America and in the whole of Latin America   2  Doctrine  The military doctrine of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces combines both Bolivarian and socialist principles  and also contributes to the development of the Venezuelan people integrated in the work of social mission promoted by the national Federal Government  This new doctrine replaced the long standing doctrine of national security formulated during the transition to democracy in the late 1950s  inspired by the model used in the United States of America   2 1  Mission Statement  According to the Article 3 of the Armed Forces Organic Law  the fundamental mission of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces is to ensure the independence and sovereignty of the nation and ensure the integrity of the geographical territories of the country  by means of military defence  cooperation

2014 all the service academies have the female students as well as the military high schools that previously been co educational since the 1980s and 1990s  and today there are already women pilots and aircrews  lady crew members of ships  and lady personnel in combat duty in the Army  and they have reached the highest military ranks as well  The late President Hugo Chavez said on July 2012 about it   not only is the promotion to a hierarchy  but the promotion that gives Venezuelan people  All women say that they feel proud to be in a country that promotes the inclusion of women   Currently the 4 components that make up the NBAF  the Army  Navy  Air Force and the National Guard  plus the National Militia and the Presidential Honor Guard Brigade as well  have courageous women who choose a military career for their professional development part of their ranks as either enlisted personnel  non commissioned officers and officers  Within these service branches  the Venezuelan military woman has achieved important positions   Boys and girls also join together as students of the various educational institutions jointly operated by the service branches of the National Armed Forces through their foundations and the Ministry of Education from pre school to the secondary level   In an opinion article published in the year 2010  it is stated that   Macho culture does not exist within the National Bolivarian Armed Forces   Historical dates of the achievements of the Venezuelan women in the National Bolivarian Armed Forces   July 1977  first contingent of women to enter a

biggest helicopter   July 4  2007  first woman promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral   December 28  2008  A woman Brigadier General founded the Military Technical School of the NBAF  today the Military Technical Academy and formerly the Armed Forces Basic School  as Directress  the first ever woman to hold the directorian post in a Venezuelan service academy   July 5  2010  the Venezuelan Government conferred Manuela Sáenz  also called the  Libertadora del Libertador    the grade of brigadier general of the Bolivarian army of Venezuela posthumously  as the  posthumous recognition of the virtues of heroine of American independence  due to her outstanding contributions in the Spanish American wars of independence   November 27  2009  first female pilot of fighter aircraft   January 23  2012  first woman to complete a flight on a Venezuelan Air Force Super King Air B200  July 3  2012  first woman promoted to Admiral   May 28  2013  The Venezuelan National Guard s Air Command welcomed its first lady pilot in history  During the National Independence Day Armed Forces Promotions ceremony at the Fort Montana Barracks in Caracas on July 5  2013  also marking 4 months after the sudden death of Hugo Chavez  President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro shocked everyone by making an historic announcement that Admiral Carmen Teresa Meléndez Rivas  the first ever Venezuelan lady admiral in history and by then the current Presidential Secretary  would be appointed as the first ever lady Minister of Defense in the nation s history as well as in its military history  She was later promoted as the very first lady 4 sun flag officer of the Venezuelan Navy and of the National Armed Forces as a whole before officially taking over her ministerial duties   8  Ranks  uniforms and insignia  8 1  Military Ranks  The most important reform in more than one century  was in 2008  with the enactment of the reform of the Organic Law of the National Armed Forces  which established  among many innovations  the transformation of the non commissioned officer level  technical officer  to commissioned officer status  As part of the same reform  the rank of Major General  intermediate rank that comes after Divisional General and before the rank of General in Chief  was officially created  In the case of the Navy  the rank of Admiral in Chief  created also by the same reforms  is now equivalent to General in Chief  Thus the officer rank system used today is more compatible to those used by most armed forces   Since 2011 the officer corps is divided into Commissioned Candidate  Regular Commissioned  Troop and Command Corps officers  the latter three  alongside the Technical Officers Corps  forming the regular officer corps and the former being composed of civilian commissioned officers   Article 62 of the Organic Law of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces has the full order of ranks of military officers  and their equivalents in the Navy  while Article 63 of the Organic Law lists the full order of ranks for non commissioned service personnel and Article 69 of the said law provides the military hierarchy of the enlisted personnel and ratings of the National Armed Forces   Amendments made in 2014 for the Organic Law of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces officially give the following as the highest rank for the following officer corps   Divisional General Vice Admiral   Technical Officers Corps  Brigadier General Rear Admiral   Troop Officers Corps  Brigadier General Rear Admiral   Commissioned Candidate Officers Corps  8 1 1  Three sun ranking  The rank of Major General  a rank immediately below the General in Chief and above Divisional General  was established in the year 2007 in the aftermath of the Armed Forces Organic Law amendments and in the Navy  Admiral  three suns  and Admiral in Chief  four suns  are the equivalent today  These officers are assigned mostly to the leadership of military regions  REDI   Commanders General of Components  General Inspectorate  vice ministers  and temporarily as Chief of the NBAF OSC  if the Minister of Defence is an official asset  with the office holder having the rank of General in Chief or Admiral in Chief  Before 2007 the 3 sun rank belonged to Generals in Chief and Admirals  and is an equivalent to the rank of lieutenant general or vice admiral in most countries   One must not confuse this rank with the General staff rank of Major General used in most of the armed forces of the world  which is equivalent to the second rank of general officers in most armies and several air forces   8 1 2  Four sun ranking  Since the age of the independence war in Venezuela the most senior officer is designated as general in chief  general en jefe   From its creation the rank was represented by three mythical suns  equivalent to three star rank   but with the creation in 2008 of the rank of Major General  four mythical suns  equivalent to four star rank  are used  If used in the Navy  it is called as admiral in chief  almirante en jefe  since 2008  formerly the 3 sun rank was of an Admiral   uses the same 4 suns in the shoulder board  and the sleeve insignia used mirrors that of a full Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy   Since 2001  15 officers have been promoted to this rank or equivalent  11 from the Army including 2 posthumously  1 from the Air Force  also posthumously  and 2 from the Navy  1 other naval receipent having been promoted to Admiral    8 1 3  Commander in Chief rank and insignia  The office of the Venezuelan military supreme commander in chief has always been held by the President of Venezuela as per constitutional requirements  however with the new law sanctioned in 2008  the “Comandante en Jefe” rank is not only a function attributed to the executive branch but a full military rank given to the President upon taking office  Upon assumption he receives a saber  epaulette  shoulder knot  shoulder board and sleeve insignia and full military uniform to be used in military events while performing the duties as President  The shoulder insignia mirrors Cuban practice but is derived from the German styled officer rank insignia   8 2  Berets  Berets are worn by some units in the National Armed Forces  with distinctive colors for some units or functions  The beret colors are as follows   9  Extensive modernization program  The Venezuelan government has embarked on a massive military purchase programme  This has included negotiations for German submarines and transport aircraft  several agreements with Russia  outlined below   transport aircraft and naval vessels from Spain  radars from China  home made and designed armored light vehicles and rocket launchers  studies for Russian main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles  amongst many others  Most if not all European military hardware have not been delivered to Venezuela due to the U S  embargo   9 1  Surveillance radars  AK 103s and helicopters  Mi 17  Mi 26 and Mi 35  Venezuela in 2005 acquired 3 JYL 1 long range 3D surveillance radars from China at a cost of $150 million  The 3 JYL 1s  which are truck mounted  were all delivered by 2007   Also that year  Venezuela bought 51 military helicopters from Russia  by 2008 all 51 had been delivered to the Venezuelan armed forces  the helicopters acquired were  40 Mi 17  3 Mi 26 and 8 Mi 35  Then in 2006 the country purchased 100 000 Russian AK 103 assault rifles  all delivered in that same year  Chavez also claimed to have acquired a license to manufacture Kalashnikovs in Venezuela  but the factory hasn t yet been built   9 2  Su 30s and missiles  In 2006 Venezuela purchased 24 Su 30MK jet fighters also from Russia  all delivered by 2008  In order to equip those fighters the country bought a large assortment of missiles  it is estimated that Venezuela acquired  200 laser guided bombs types KAB 500 and KAB 1500  50 Kh 29 air to surface missiles  50 Kh 31A1 anti ship missiles  50 Kh 59ME TV guided cruise missiles  100 Vympel R 27 medium range air to air missiles and 150 Vympel R 73 short range air to air missiles   9 3  Night vision equipment  sniper rifles and submarines  In 2007  the Belarussian military optics industry agreed to supply the Venezuelan army with night vision devices  and install on  as Hugo Chavez described   every single rifle in the Venezuelan army   The deal is valued at $3–$24 million  Later that year  Chavez announced plans to purchase of 5 000 Dragunov sniper rifles from the Russian Rosoboronexport  adding that Venezuela must ready itself for a  possible U S  invasion   It is not clear whether that deal was completed  In all  from 2005 to 2007 Venezuela purchased more than $4 4 billion in weapons from Russia   After signing an  initial contract   Venezuela was expected in June 2007 to finalize the acquisition of five diesel Project 636 Kilo class submarines  and at a later date finalize the acquisition of four diesel Project 677 Amur class submarines  In spite of the expectations  Chavez didn t sign the deal  Ten months later in April 2008  Venezuela decided to negotiate with Russia a loan of about $800 million for the acquisition of 4 diesel Project 636 Kilo class submarines  During that time Venezuela was also considering the purchase of 12 Il 76 transport aircraft  The submarines plus the aircraft were going to cost a total of $1 5 billion  However  this acquisition deal wasn t completed either  The negotiations for the purchase of the submarines broke down and 6 submarines that were once planned for Venezuela are now being offered to Vietnam   9 4  Russian loans and the Chinese K 8W light jet  In September 2008  Russia provided Venezuela with a $1 billion loan to buy Russian weapons  A Kremlin source said  The Russian side has made the decision to extend to Venezuela a $1 billion loan for a military cooperation program   There is a lot of speculation about which weapons will be bought with that loan  Venezuela has shown interest on the following weapons  TOR M1 SAM systems  T 72 tanks  Su 35 jet fighters and Il 76 military cargo aircraft  Despite of the interest and the Russian credit line  no deal has been finalized  In October 2008 Rosoboronexport informed that Venezuela was close to buying among other things a  large shipment of BMP 3  infantry fighting vehicles  however that deal too wasn t finalized   Also in September Chavez confirmed that Venezuela purchased 24 K 8 Karakorum trainer jets from China  The deal  which is estimated to be worth between $72–$84 million  was the biggest Venezuelan arms deal of 2008   On the 21 of July 2010  one Chinese K 8 light jet went down  Pilot and assistant ejected   Venezuela has acquired an undisclosed number of SA 24 Igla S man portable surface to air missiles  The SA 24 Igla S is the most advanced version built in Russia  This acquisition was only confirmed after 50 SA 24 Igla S were paraded by soldiers in Caracas in April 2009  In reaction to the acquisition the US State Department declared   We are concerned about Venezuelan arms purchases that exceed its needs and are therefore potentially destabilizing    In September 2009 Russia agreed to loan Venezuela over $2 billion to finance the purchase of weapons including tanks and advanced anti aircraft missiles  It was stated that because of lower crude prices  the country needed to borrow the money for defence spending to avoid cuts in education and health  The deal includes orders for 92 T 72 tanks and the Buk M2  S 125 Neva Pechora missile system and S 300 air defence systems and also the BM 30 Smerch rocket artillery system  President Hugo Chavez stated that  Venezuela has no plans to invade anybody  or to be aggressive towards anybody   and  with these rockets it s going to be very difficult for foreign planes to come and bomb us   Chavez repeated Venezuela s commitment to developing nuclear power for peaceful purposes with the help of Russia and reiterated his strong opposition to nuclear weapons   9 5  Signed contract with China for 500 million dollars  to provide Venezuelan Marine Corps  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says his government will buy amphibious tanks from China for its military  Chavez isn t saying how many of the armored vehicles Venezuela intends to buy  but says the deal signed Tuesday calls for a Chinese company to begin delivering the tanks next year  He announced the deal in a speech to troops  saying the $500 million cost will be financed through loans that China has offered Venezuela in exchange for oil shipments   9 6  The Russian Federation gives new credit and Venezuelan Government shows interest in the Su 35  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said he is interested in buying Sukhoi Su 35 Flanker E multirole fighter jets from Russia to enhance his country’s defense capabilities   I have already sent a statement to the government of Russia that we are ready to consider buying in the next few years Su 35 fighters to modernize and enhance our defense powers  Venezuela’s national radio quoted Chavez as saying   Russia and Venezuela have signed an agreement on a $4 billion loan for the oil rich Latin American partner to buy Russian weaponry  “Two billion will be provided next year and another two billion in 2013” Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said   10  Controversy with the United States  These acquisitions and other projects have been greeted with criticism from the United States  which opposes the government of President Hugo Chávez  The U S  accuses Venezuela of starting an arms race  which they claim will destabilize the military equilibrium in South America  Venezuela is also accused of supplying small arms to neighboring Colombian guerrilla organizations including FARC  which is sympathetic to Chávez   United States criticism is met with skepticism by Venezuelan authorities  who claim the weapons are needed to update the basic equipment in the armed forces  In some cases  Venezuelan armaments like the FN FAL have been in service more than 50 years  The government also claims that the U S  has been the one to initiate arms races and de stabilize countries by supplying subversive groups in Latin America throughout the past century  referring to the 1954 Guatemalan coup d état during the Cold War  and the contra affair  among numerous other incidents    In the 1990s Venezuela requested a batch of F 16C Ds to update its F 16 fighter fleet  but the U S  government blocked the request  In October 1997 the U S  government approved the sale of the two crash replacement F 16s  but subsequently halted the sale  In 2005 a contract with Israel Aircraft Industries to upgrade Venezuela s F 16s was frozen following U S  pressure  Chavez subsequently accused the U S  of delaying the sale of spare parts to maintain Venezuela’s F 16s  After remarks by Chavez that he would sell or lend the  unused  F 16 s to any country that wanted them  including Iran  the U S  Government agreed to supply the spare parts  however  the shipment was detained at the Customs Office in Maiquetia International Airport due to security concerns   10 1  U S  military embargo  In May 2006  the government of the United States announced an embargo of military material and equipment to Venezuela  no American made weapons or technology can be sold to Venezuela by any country or company  This embargo has harmed several Venezuelan purchases  as not only are U S  technology goods unavailable  but other nations friendly to the U S  have been pressured to block sales of arms to Venezuela  as well  This is also considered one of the reasons Venezuela has turned to Russia and China for arms  in a move reminiscent of the Cold War   In 2005 Venezuela signed agreements with Spain to procure 12 naval transport and reconnaissance aircraft and eight naval patrol vessels  The deal is worth $1 5 2 billion dollars to the Spanish defense industry  as well as an estimated 900 new jobs  but was cancelled due to the U S  embargo  The cancellation does not affect the eight naval patrol vessels   Below is a list of acquisitions frustrated directly or indirectly by the U S  embargo   Aero L 159 Alca Jets from the Czech Republic  the Czech government forbade Aero Vodochody  the manufacturer  from creating a variant with French avionics and Ukrainian engines  specially requested by Venezuela   Saab AB  a Swedish arms company announced it would honor the U S  embargo  and would not sell arms to Venezuela  Carl Gustav recoilless rifles  AT4 AT weapons  as well as RBS 70 AA systems are in service in the Venezuelan military   Spanish company EADS CASA halted the sale of several transport planes that contained extensive U S  technology   Brazil was forced to cancel the sale of Embraer Super Tucano airplanes to the Venezuelan Air Force due to its use of Pratt & Whitney engines  Embraer was also forced to cancel the sale of AEW&C equipped planes   France decided to block the sale of Scorpène class submarines to Venezuela   Russian companies Rosoboronexport and Sukhoi have been sanctioned by the U S  government for procuring arms for Venezuela   10 2  The Russian Federation has broken the U S  embargo  However  the Russian Federation has continued sending arms to Venezuela despite the US embargo  Russia has agreed to sell more than $4 billion  £2 billion  worth of armaments to Venezuela since 2005 and disclosed that Mr Chávez wanted new antiaircraft systems and more fighter jets   10 3  Caracas acknowledges problems with Iran by U S  embargo  The Venezuela President  Hugo Chávez  acknowledged that the joint production between his country and Iran cars  has been affected by the embargo that United States keeps on the Islamic country   10 4  Spanish Defense Minister  defends arms sales to Venezuela  Minister of the Defence of the Kingdom of Spain  defends himself against the Spanish Parliament  the sale of weapons to Venezuela  The Minister of defense  Pedro Morenes  has defended the sale of military equipment to Venezuela  and reported that a delegation from the public company Navantia has traveled to the capital of the country  Caracas  to try to sell new products to the Government of Hugo Chávez  Morenes has made these statements during his speech at the plenary session of the Congress to reply to an interpellation by the spokesman for Izquierda Unida  Jose Luis Centella  on the Ministry of defence plans for the coming years and the Spanish missions abroad   10 5  Pre military education controversy  In 2014  El Impulso reported that at Lieutenant Vicente Landaeta Gil Air Base  Venezuelan military officials forced high school students of Mary Help of Christians School participating in pre military activities to say the following cadence    Quiero bañarme en una piscina llena de sangre  de sangre gringa   or   I want to bathe in a pool of blood  of gringa  American  blood   This is the very example of one of the many military cadences used by the NBAF during outdoor marches and or runs  As El Impulso reported  that cadence used during the ROTC style activities there was anti US in content   11  Role of the military in Venezuelan politics  From 1810 up to the 1819 Angostura Congress that created Gran Colombia  and into the era of national independence since 1831  the National Armed Forces helped shaped the political  economical  social and national affairs of Venezuela  with so many military led governments that led the nation until the late 1950s  with a brief break in the 1940s   several of them under strong military dicators  After Marcos Perez Jimenez left in 1958  the military role in government affairs ended with the framing of the 1961 Constitution and the replacement by civilian leaders of the military anti Jimenez government that took power after the 1958 coup  However  the years that followed saw 2 coup attempts by military personnel with the help of groups disillusioned by government policies in the 1960s  and military repressions of student and civil rallies and actions from the late 60s onward  all these happening while fighting rebel groups present in the national territory and on the Venezuelan Colombian border region  All these led up to the events of the 1989 Caracazo  in which National Guardsmen crushed anti government actions and riots in the capital area with great severity  causing the deaths of hundreds  which in turn resulted in the coup attempts of 1992 and 1993   By the time Hugo Chavez assumed the presidency in 1999  retired armed forces personnel who served with him were appointed to several cabinet posts and seats in the National Assembly  Chavez only allowed retired military personnel to run for elective posts at all levels as well as to serve in appointive government positions except for the Ministries of Defense and the Interior  per tradition led by active generals of the armed forces  the latter since the 1950s    One of the advances achieved in the new Bolivarian Constitution of 1999 was to allow the right to vote in the elections to all service personnel of the armed forces without any limitation whatsoever  This is the right enshrined in article 64 of the said Constitution   11 1  Venezuelan military coup d états  The NAF were involved in

questioned the level of politicism and influence of the armed forces in national political affairs   12  Role in Venezuelan society  12 1  Humanitarian relief  The tragedy of Vargas in December 1999  brought with it several lessons  that the Government knew how to assimilate  one of them was the quick action of the FANB to assist populations in danger  and the reconstruction of devastated areas  Since then  Venezuela through the FANB  participated in numerous actions of humanitarian assistance  in several countries of the world   Humanitarian International Brigade  Simón Bolívar  It is a unit created in order to attend immediately to populations affected by natural calamities  both nationally and internationally  Task forces of this unit have provided support to countries like Nicaragua

industrial development in the defence sector  that sector still far from compared to countries such as Brazil  Argentina  Chile  Cuba  Colombia or Mexico in the region  if it has meant a noticeable advance respect to the last decade of the 20th century Venezuelan  In the opinion of Francisco Arias Cardenas  ex   presidential candidate  former member of parliament  and current candidate for the governorship of Zulia State  by the ruling party PSUV    in the 13 years of management of the current Government there has been an armed forces industry of its own  having the autonomy that lacked in the Fourth Republic  when transnational corporations controlled the military sector of the country  This advance of the Venezuelan military industry gives us a range of greater encouragement  that is what we need  and the possibility of applying our inventiveness to the development of technologies that give us genuine autonomy to defend our territory    Today Venezuela manufactures all terrain
