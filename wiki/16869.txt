The Poor Fellow Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon     commonly known as the Knights Templar  the Order of the Temple    or simply as Templars  were among the most wealthy and powerful of the Western Christian military orders and were among the most prominent actors of the Christian finance  The organisation existed for nearly two centuries during the Middle Ages   Officially endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church around 1129  the Order became a favoured charity throughout Christendom and grew rapidly in membership and power  Templar knights  in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross  were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades  Non combatant members of the Order managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom  innovating financial techniques that were an early form of banking  and building fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land   The Templars  existence was tied closely to the Crusades  when the Holy Land was lost  support for the Order faded  Rumours about the Templars  secret initiation ceremony created mistrust and King Philip IV of France  deeply in debt to the Order  took advantage of the situation  In 1307  many of the Order s members in France were arrested  tortured into giving false confessions  and then burned at the stake  Under pressure from King Philip  Pope Clement V disbanded the Order in 1312  The abrupt disappearance of a major part of the European infrastructure gave rise to speculation and legends  which have kept the  Templar  name alive into the modern day   1  History  1 1  Rise  After the First Crusade recaptured Jerusalem in 1099  many Christians made pilgrimages to various Holy Places in the Holy Land  However  though the city of Jerusalem was under relatively secure control  the rest of Outremer was not  Bandits and marauding highwaymen preyed upon pilgrims who were routinely slaughtered  sometimes by the hundreds  as they attempted to make the journey from the coastline at Jaffa into the interior of the Holy Land   In 1120  the French knight Hugues de Payens approached King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Warmund  Patriarch of Jerusalem and proposed creating a monastic order for the protection of these pilgrims  King Baldwin and Patriarch Warmund agreed to the request  probably at the Council of Nablus in January 1120  and the king granted the Templars a headquarters in a wing of the royal palace on the Temple Mount in the captured Al Aqsa Mosque  The Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what was believed to be the ruins of the Temple of Solomon  The Crusaders therefore referred to the Al Aqsa Mosque as Solomon s Temple  and it was from this location that the new Order took the name of Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon  or  Templar  knights  The Order  with about nine knights including Godfrey de Saint Omer and André de Montbard  had few financial resources and relied on donations to survive  Their emblem was of two knights riding on a single horse  emphasising the Order s poverty   The impoverished status of the Templars did not last long  They had a powerful advocate in Saint Bernard of Clairvaux  a leading Church figure  French abbot primarily responsible for the founding of the Cistercian Order of monks and a nephew of André de Montbard  one of the founding knights  Bernard put his weight behind them and wrote persuasively on their behalf in the letter  In Praise of the New Knighthood   and in 1129  at the Council of Troyes  he led a group of leading churchmen to officially approve and endorse the Order on behalf of the Church  With this formal blessing  the Templars became a favoured charity throughout Christendom  receiving money  land  businesses  and noble born sons from families who were eager to help with the fight in the Holy Land  Another major benefit came in 1139  when Pope Innocent II s papal bull Omne Datum Optimum exempted the Order from obedience to local laws  This ruling meant that the Templars could pass freely through all borders  were not required to pay any taxes  and were exempt from all authority except that of the pope   With its clear mission and ample resources  the Order grew rapidly  Templars were often the advance shock troops in key battles of the Crusades  as the heavily armoured knights on their warhorses would set out to charge at the enemy  ahead of the main army bodies  in an attempt to break opposition lines  One of their most famous victories was in 1177 during the Battle of Montgisard  where some 500 Templar knights helped several thousand infantry to defeat Saladin s army of more than 26 000 soldiers   Although the primary mission of the Order was military  relatively few members were combatants  The others acted in support positions to assist the knights and to manage the financial infrastructure  The Templar Order  though its members were sworn to individual poverty  was given control of wealth beyond direct donations  A nobleman who was interested in participating in the Crusades might place all his assets under Templar management while he was away  Accumulating wealth in this manner throughout Christendom and the Outremer  the Order in 1150 began generating letters of credit for pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land  pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking  received a document indicating the value of their deposit  then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value  This innovative arrangement was an early form of banking and may have been the first formal system to support the use of cheques  it improved the safety of pilgrims by making them less attractive targets for thieves  and also contributed to the Templar coffers   Based on this mix of donations and business dealing  the Templars established financial networks across the whole of Christendom  They acquired large tracts of land  both in Europe and the Middle East  they bought and managed farms and vineyards  they built churches and castles  they were involved in manufacturing  import and export  they had their own fleet of ships  and at one point they even owned the entire island of Cyprus  The Order of the Knights Templar arguably qualifies as the world s first multinational corporation   1 2  Decline  In the mid 12th century  the tide began to turn in the Crusades  The Muslim world had become more united under effective leaders such as Saladin  and dissension arose amongst Christian factions in  and concerning  the Holy Land  The Knights Templar were occasionally at odds with the two other Christian military orders  the Knights Hospitaller and the Teutonic Knights  and decades of internecine feuds weakened Christian positions  both politically and militarily  After the Templars were involved in several unsuccessful campaigns  including the pivotal Battle of the Horns of Hattin  Jerusalem was recaptured by Muslim forces under Saladin in 1187  The Crusaders regained the city in 1229  without Templar aid  but held it only briefly  In 1244  the Khwarezmi Turks recaptured Jerusalem  and the city did not return to Western control until 1917 when the British captured it from the Ottoman Turks in World War One   The Templars were forced to relocate their headquarters to other cities in the north  such as the seaport of Acre  which they held for the next century  It was lost in 1291  followed by their last mainland strongholds  Tortosa  Tartus in what is now Syria  and Atlit in present day Israel  Their headquarters then moved to Limassol on the island of Cyprus  and they also attempted to maintain a garrison on tiny Arwad Island  just off the coast from Tortosa  In 1300  there was some attempt to engage in coordinated military efforts with the Mongols via a new invasion force at Arwad  In 1302 or 1303  however  the Templars lost the island to the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Arwad  With the island gone  the Crusaders lost their last foothold in the Holy Land   With the Order s military mission now less important  support for the organisation began to dwindle  The situation was complex  however  since during the two hundred years of their existence  the Templars had become a part of daily life throughout Christendom  The organisation s Templar Houses  hundreds of which were dotted throughout Europe and the Near East  gave them a widespread presence at the local level  The Templars still managed many businesses  and many Europeans had daily contact with the Templar network  such as by working at a Templar farm or vineyard  or using the Order as a bank in which to store personal valuables  The Order was still not subject to local government  making it everywhere a  state within a state —its standing army  though it no longer had a well defined mission  could pass freely through all borders  This situation heightened tensions with some European nobility  especially as the Templars were indicating an interest in founding their own monastic state  just as the Teutonic Knights had done in Prussia and the Knights Hospitaller were doing in Rhodes   1 3  Arrests  charges and dissolution  In 1305  the new Pope Clement V  based in Avignon  France  sent letters to both the Templar Grand Master Jacques de Molay and the Hospitaller Grand Master Fulk de Villaret to discuss the possibility of merging the two Orders  Neither was amenable to the idea  but Pope Clement persisted  and in 1306 he invited both Grand Masters to France to discuss the matter  De Molay arrived first in early 1307  but de Villaret was delayed for several months  While waiting  De Molay and Clement discussed criminal charges that had been made two years earlier by an ousted Templar and were being discussed by King Philip IV of France and his ministers  It was generally agreed that the charges were false  but Clement sent the king a written request for assistance in the investigation  According to some historians  King Philip  who was already deeply in debt to the Templars from his war with the English  decided to seize upon the rumors for his own purposes  He began pressuring the Church to take action against the Order  as a way of freeing himself from his debts  The French king s motivations went beyond merely financial though  By charging the Templars with heresy  the monarchy was also claiming for itself a charism proper to the papacy  The Templar case was another step in a process of appropriating these foundations  which had begun with the Franco papal rift at the time of Boniface VIII   At dawn on Friday  13 October 1307  a date sometimes spuriously linked with the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition  King Philip IV ordered de Molay and scores of other French Templars to be simultaneously arrested  The arrest warrant started with the phrase    Dieu n est pas content  nous avons des ennemis de la foi dans le Royaume    God is not pleased  We have enemies of the faith in the kingdom    Claims were made that during Templar admissions ceremonies  recruits were forced to spit on the cross  deny Christ  and engage in indecent kissing  brethren were also accused of worshiping idols  and the order was said to have encouraged homosexual practices  The Templars were charged with numerous other offences  financial corruption and fraud  and secrecy  Many of the accused confessed to these charges under torture  and these confessions  even though obtained under duress  caused a scandal in Paris  The prisoners were coerced to confess that they had spat on the Cross    Moi Raymond de La Fère  21 ans  reconnais que  J ai  craché trois fois sur la Croix  mais de bouche et pas de coeur   free translation    I  Raymond de La Fère  21 years old  admit that I have spat three times on the Cross  but only from my mouth and not from my heart    The Templars were accused of idolatry and were suspected of worshipping either a figure known as Baphomet or a mummified severed head they recovered  amongst other artifacts  at their original headquarters on the Temple Mount that many scholars theorize might have been that of John the Baptist  among other things   Relenting to Phillip s demands  Pope Clement then issued the papal bull Pastoralis Praeeminentiae on 22 November 1307  which instructed all Christian monarchs in Europe to arrest all Templars and seize their assets  Pope Clement called for papal hearings to determine the Templars  guilt or innocence  and once freed of the Inquisitors  torture  many Templars recanted their confessions  Some had sufficient legal experience to defend themselves in the trials  but in 1310  having appointed the archbishop of Sens  Philippe de Marigny  to lead the investigation  Philip blocked this attempt  using the previously forced confessions to have dozens of Templars burned at the stake in Paris   With Philip threatening military action unless the pope complied with his wishes  Pope Clement finally agreed to disband the Order  citing the public scandal that had been generated by the confessions  At the Council of Vienne in 1312  he issued a series of papal bulls  including Vox in excelso  which officially dissolved the Order  and Ad providam  which turned over most Templar assets to the Hospitallers   As for the leaders of the Order  the elderly Grand Master Jacques de Molay  who had confessed under torture  retracted his confession  Geoffroi de Charney  Preceptor of Normandy  also retracted his confession and insisted on his innocence  Both men were declared guilty of being relapsed heretics  and they were sentenced to burn alive at the stake in Paris on 18 March 1314  De Molay reportedly remained defiant to the end  asking to be tied in such a way that he could face the Notre Dame Cathedral and hold his hands together in prayer  According to legend  he called out from the flames that both Pope Clement and King Philip would soon meet him before God  His actual words were recorded on the parchment as follows    Dieu sait qui a tort et a péché  Il va bientot arriver malheur à ceux qui nous ont condamnés à mort   free translation    God knows who is wrong and has sinned  Soon a calamity will occur to those who have condemned us to death    Pope Clement died only a month later  and King Philip died in a hunting accident before the end of the year   With the last of the Order s leaders gone  the remaining Templars around Europe were either arrested and tried under the Papal investigation  with virtually none convicted   absorbed into other military orders such as the Knights Hospitaller  or pensioned off and allowed to live out their days peacefully  By papal decree  the property of the Templars was transferred to the Order of Hospitallers  which also absorbed many of the Templars  members  In effect  the dissolution of the Templars could be seen as the merger of the two rival orders  Some may have fled to other territories outside Papal control  such as excommunicated Scotland or to Switzerland  Templar organisations in Portugal simply changed their name  from Knights Templar to Knights of Christ   1 4  Chinon Parchment  In September 2001  a document known as the  Chinon Parchment  dated 17–20 August 1308 was discovered in the Vatican Secret Archives by Barbara Frale  apparently after having been filed in the wrong place in 1628  It is a record of the trial of the Templars and shows that Clement absolved the Templars of all heresies in 1308 before formally disbanding the Order in 1312  as did another Chinon Parchment dated 20 August 1308 addressed to Philip IV of France  also mentioning that all Templars that had confessed to heresy were  restored to the Sacraments and to the unity of the Church   This other Chinon Parchment has been well known to historians having been published by Étienne Baluze in 1693  and by Pierre Dupuy in 1751   The current position of the Roman Catholic Church is that the medieval persecution of the Knights Templar was unjust  that nothing was inherently wrong with the Order or its Rule  and that Pope Clement was pressed into his actions by the magnitude of the public scandal and by the dominating influence of King Philip IV  who was Clement s relative   2  Organization  The Templars were organised as a monastic order similar to Bernard s Cistercian Order  which was considered the first effective international organisation in Europe  The organisational structure had a strong chain of authority  Each country with a major Templar presence  France  England  Aragon  Portugal  Poitou  Apulia  Jerusalem  Tripoli  Antioch  Anjou  Hungary  and Croatia  had a Master of the Order for the Templars in that region   All of them were subject to the Grand Master  appointed for life  who oversaw both the Order s military efforts in the East and their financial holdings in the West  The Grand Master exercised his authority via the visitors general of the order  who were knights specially appointed by the Grand Master and convent of Jerusalem to visit the different provinces  correct malpractices  introduce new regulations  and resolve important disputes  The visitors general had the power to remove knights from office and to suspend the Master of the province concerned   No precise numbers exist  but it is estimated that at the Order s peak there were between 15 000 and 20 000 Templars  of whom about a tenth were actual knights   2 1  Ranks within the order  2 1 1  Three main ranks  There was a threefold division of the ranks of the Templars  the noble knights  the non noble sergeants  and the chaplains  The Templars did not perform knighting ceremonies  so any knight wishing to become a Knight Templar had to be a knight already  They were the most visible branch of the order  and wore the famous white mantles to symbolise their purity and chastity  They were equipped as heavy cavalry  with three or four horses and one or two squires  Squires were generally not members of the Order but were instead outsiders who were hired for a set period of time  Beneath the knights in the Order and drawn from non noble families were the sergeants  They brought vital skills and trades such as blacksmithing and building  and administered many of the Order s European properties  In the Crusader States  they fought alongside the knights as light cavalry with a single horse  Several of the Order s most senior positions were reserved for sergeants  including the post of Commander of the Vault of Acre  who was the de facto Admiral of the Templar fleet  The sergeants wore black or brown  From 1139  chaplains constituted a third Templar class  They were ordained priests who cared for the Templar s  spiritual needs  All three classes of brother wore the Order s red cross patty   2 1 2  Grand Masters  Starting with founder Hugues de Payens in 1118–1119  the Order s highest office was that of Grand Master  a position which was held for life  though considering the martial nature of the Order  this could mean a very short tenure  All but two of the Grand Masters died in office  and several died during military campaigns  For example  during the Siege of Ascalon in 1153  Grand Master Bernard de Tremelay led a group of 40 Templars through a breach in the city walls  When the rest of the Crusader army did not follow  the Templars  including their Grand Master  were surrounded and beheaded  Grand Master Gérard de Ridefort was beheaded by Saladin in 1189 at the Siege of Acre   The Grand Master oversaw all of the operations of the Order  including both the military operations in the Holy Land and Eastern Europe and the Templars  financial and business dealings in Western Europe  Some Grand Masters also served as battlefield commanders  though this was not always wise  several blunders in de Ridefort s combat leadership contributed to the devastating defeat at the Battle of Hattin  The last Grand Master was Jacques de Molay  burned at the stake in Paris in 1314 by order of King Philip IV   2 2  Behaviour and clothing  It was Bernard de Clairvaux and founder Hugues de Payens who devised the specific code of behaviour for the Templar Order  known to modern historians as the Latin Rule  Its 72 clauses defined the ideal behaviour for the Knights  such as the types of garments they were to wear and how many horses they could have  Knights were to take their meals in silence  eat meat no more than three times per week  and not have physical contact of any kind with women  even members of their own family  A Master of the Order was assigned  4 horses  and one chaplain brother and one clerk with three horses  and one sergeant brother with two horses  and one gentleman valet to carry his shield and lance  with one horse   As the Order grew  more guidelines were added  and the original list of 72 clauses was expanded to several hundred in its final form   The knights wore a white surcoat with a red cross and a white mantle also with a red cross  the sergeants wore a black tunic with a red cross on the front and a black or brown mantle  The white mantle was assigned to the Templars at the Council of Troyes in 1129  and the cross was most probably added to their robes at the launch of the Second Crusade in 1147  when Pope Eugenius III  King Louis VII of France  and many other notables attended a meeting of the French Templars at their headquarters near Paris  According to their Rule  the knights were to wear the white mantle at all times  even being forbidden to eat or drink unless they were wearing it   The red cross that the Templars wore on their robes was a symbol of martyrdom  and to die in combat was considered a great honour that assured a place in heaven  There was a cardinal rule that the warriors of the Order should never surrender unless the Templar flag had fallen  and even then they were first to try to regroup with another of the Christian orders  such as that of the Hospitallers  Only after all flags had fallen were they allowed to leave the battlefield  This uncompromising principle  along with their reputation for courage  excellent training  and heavy armament  made the Templars one of the most feared combat forces in medieval times   Although not prescribed by the Templar Rule  it later became customary for members of the order to wear long and prominent beards  In about 1240  Alberic of Trois Fontaines described the Templars as an  order of bearded brethren   while during the interrogations by the papal commissioners in Paris in 1310–11  out of nearly 230 knights and brothers questioned  76 are described as wearing a beard  in some cases specified as being  in the style of the Templars   and 133 are said to have shaved off their beards  either in renunciation of the order or because they had hoped to escape detection   Initiation  known as Reception  receptio  into the Order  was a profound commitment and involved a solemn ceremony  Outsiders were discouraged from attending the ceremony  which aroused the suspicions of medieval inquisitors during the later trials  New members had to willingly sign over all of their wealth and goods to the Order and take vows of poverty  chastity  piety  and obedience  Most brothers joined for life  although some were allowed to join for a set period  Sometimes a married man was allowed to join if he had his wife s permission  but he was not allowed to wear the white mantle   3  Legacy  With their military mission and extensive financial resources  the Knights Templar funded a large number of building projects around Europe and the Holy Land  Many of these structures are still standing  Many sites also maintain the name  Temple  because of centuries old association with the Templars  For example  some of the Templars  lands in London were later rented to lawyers  which led to the names of the Temple Bar gateway and the Temple Underground station  Two of the four Inns of Court which may call members to act as barristers are the Inner Temple and Middle Temple   Distinctive architectural elements of Templar buildings include the use of the image of  two knights on a single horse   representing the Knights  poverty  and round buildings designed to resemble the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem   3 1  Modern organizations  The story of the persecution and sudden dissolution of the secretive yet powerful medieval Templars has drawn many other groups to use alleged connections with the Templars as a way of enhancing their own image and mystery  There is no clear historical connection between the Knights Templar  which were dismantled in the Rolls of the Catholic Church in 1309 with the martyrdom of Jacques de Molay  and any of the modern organizations  of which  except for the Scottish Order  the earliest emerged publicly in the 18th century  There is often public confusion and many overlook the 400 year gap  However  in 1853  Napoleon III officially recognized the OSMTH  The Order operates on the basis of the traditions of the medieval Knights Templar  celebrating the spirit of  but not claiming direct descent from the ancient Order founded by Hugues de Payens in 1118 and dissolved by Pope Clement V in 1312   3 1 1  Freemasonry  Since at least the 18th century  Freemasonry has incorporated Templar symbols and rituals in a number of Masonic bodies  most notably  the  Order of the Temple  the final order joined in  The United Religious  Military and Masonic Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem  Palestine  Rhodes and Malta  commonly known as the Knights Templar  One theory of the origins of Freemasonry claims direct descent from the historical Knights Templar through its final fourteenth century members who took refuge in Scotland whose King  Robert the Bruce was excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church at the time  or in Portugal where the order changed its name to Knights of Christ  other members having joined Knights of St  John  There have even been claims that some of the Templars who made it to Scotland contributed to the Scots  victory at Bannockburn  This theory is usually deprecated on grounds of lack of evidence  by both Masonic authorities and historians   The Roman Catholic Church has historically opposed Freemasonry since it began to emerge  under the belief that the group is a  Secret Society  and has a deeply hidden agenda that opposes the church and its beliefs  Members of the Church found to be Freemasons were commonly excommunicated  This has often led to the misguided belief that the Church somehow also opposed the Knights Templar  however the Church makes distinction between the Templars  a public monastic order  and  Secret Societies    The penalty of excommunication for joining the Masonic Lodge was explicit in the 1917 code of canon law  canon 2335   and it is implicit in the 1983 code  canon 1374   Because the revised code of canon law is not explicit on this point  some drew the mistaken conclusion that the Church s prohibition of Freemasonry had been dropped  As a result of this confusion  shortly before the 1983 code was promulgated  the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a statement indicating that the penalty was still in force  This statement was dated November 26  1983 and may be found in Origins 13 27  Nov  15  1983   450   3 2  Legends and relics  The Knights Templar have become associated with legends concerning secrets and mysteries handed down to the select from ancient times  Rumors circulated even during the time of the Templars themselves  Freemasonic writers added their own speculations in the 19th century  and further fictional embellishments have been added in popular novels such as Ivanhoe  Foucault s Pendulum  The Lost symbol  and The Da Vinci Code  modern movies such as National Treasure and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  and video games such as Assassin s Creed  The Secret World and Broken Sword   Many of the Templar legends are connected with the Order s early occupation of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and speculation about what relics the Templars may have found there  such as the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant  That the Templars were in possession of some relics is certain  Many churches still display holy relics such as the bones of a saint  a piece of cloth thought to be imprinted with the face of Jesus Christ  or the skull of a martyr  the Templars did the same  They were documented as having a piece of the True Cross  which the Bishop of Acre carried into battle at the disastrous Horns of Hattin  When the battle was lost  Saladin captured the relic  which was then ransomed back to the Crusaders when the Muslims surrendered the city of Acre in 1191  The Templars were also rumored to possess the head of Saint Euphemia of Chalcedon  and the subject of relics came up during the Inquisition of the Templars  as several trial documents refer to the supposed worship of an idol of some type  referred to in some cases as a cat  a bearded head  or in some cases as Baphomet  This accusation of idol worship levied against the Templars has also led to the modern mistaken belief by some that the Templars practiced witchcraft  However  modern scholars generally explain the name Baphomet from the trial documents as simply a French misspelling of the name Mahomet  Muhammad    The Holy Grail quickly became associated with the Templars  even in the 12th century  The first Grail romance  Le Conte du Graal  was written around 1180 by Chrétien de Troyes  who came from the same area where the Council of Troyes had officially sanctioned the Templars  Order  Perhaps twenty years later Parzival  Wolfram von Eschenbach s version of the tale  refers to knights called  Templeisen  guarding the Grail Kingdom  Another hero of the Grail quest  Sir Galahad  a 13th century literary invention of monks from St  Bernard s Cistercian Order  was depicted bearing a shield with the cross of Saint George  similar to the Templars  insignia  this version presented the Holy Grail as a Christian relic  A legend developed that since the Templars had their headquarters at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem  they must have excavated in search of relics  found the Grail  and then proceeded to keep it in secret and guard it with their lives  However  in the extensive documents of the Templar inquisition there was never a single mention of anything like a Grail relic  let alone its possession by the Templars  nor is there any evidence that a Templar wrote a Grail Romance  In reality  most mainstream scholars agree that the story of the Grail was just that  a literary fiction that began circulating in medieval times   Another legendary object that is claimed to have some connection with the Templars is the Shroud of Turin  In 1357  the shroud was first publicly displayed by the widow of a nobleman known as Geoffrey of Charney  described by some sources as being a member of the family of the grandson of Geoffroi de Charney  who was burned at the stake with De Molay  The shroud s origins are still a matter of controversy  but in 1988  a carbon dating analysis concluded that the shroud was made between 1260 and 1390  a span that includes the last half century of the Templars  existence  The validity of the dating methodology has subsequently been called into question  and the age of the shroud is still the subject of much debate  4
