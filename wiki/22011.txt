The is a cartridge based arcade system board and home video game console released on January 31  1990 by Japanese game company SNK  Although it is a member of the fourth generation of video game consoles  it is the first system in the Neo Geo family  which ran throughout the 1990s before being revived in December 2012 with the Neo Geo X handheld and home system   The MVS  Multi Video System   as the Neo Geo is known to the coin operated arcade game industry  offers owners the ability to put up to six different arcade titles into a single cabinet  a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace  With its games stored on self contained cartridges  a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game s ROM cartridge and cabinet artwork  The platform s popular series include Fatal Fury  The King of Fighters  Metal Slug and Samurai Shodown   The Neo Geo system is also a notably costly and technologically uncompromised home console  commonly referred to today as the AES  Advanced Entertainment System   The Neo Geo was marketed as 24 bit  though it is technically a parallel processing 16 bit 68000 based system with an 8 bit Z80 coprocessor   Neo Geo hardware production lasted seven years  discontinued in 1997  and game software production lasted fourteen years  discontinued in 2004  In 2009  the Neo Geo was ranked 19th out of the 25 best video game consoles of all time by the video game website IGN  There is an amateur and professional commercial homebrew market for the system   1  History  Initially  the  AES  home system was only available for rent to commercial establishments  such as hotel chains  bars and restaurants  and other venues  When customer response indicated that some gamers were willing to buy a console  SNK expanded sales and marketing into the home console market  The Neo Geo console was officially launched on January 31  1990 in Osaka  Japan  Neo Geo s graphics and sound are largely superior to other contemporary home consoles  and the MVS is one of the most powerful arcade units at the time  Furthermore  since the AES was identical to its arcade counterpart  the MVS  arcade titles released for the home market are perfect translations  Although its high price tag kept it out of the mainstream gaming market  it outlasted the market lifespan of the more popular Sega Mega Drive Genesis   In the United States  the console s debut price was planned to be and included two joystick controllers and a game  either Baseball Stars Professional or NAM 1975  However  the price was raised and its American launch debuted as the Gold System at   Later  the Gold System was bundled with Magician Lord and Fatal Fury  The Silver System package  launched at   includes one joystick controller and does not include a game  Other games were launched at about and up  At double or quadruple the competition  these premium prices made the console accessible only to a niche market   Several home console systems were created based on the same hardware as the arcade games  as well as a series of handheld systems under the Neo Geo brand  These systems include the following  Hyper Neo Geo 64 arcade system  Neo Geo CD  Neo Geo Pocket  Neo Geo Pocket Color  and Neo Geo X  The most recent  the Neo Geo X  is an officially licensed device with a collection of Neo Geo AES games pre installed   When realtime 3D graphics became the norm in the arcade industry  the Neo Geo s 2D hardware was unable to do likewise  The last official game by SNK for the Neo Geo system  Samurai Shodown V Special  was released in 2004  SNK ceased to manufacture home consoles by the end of 1997  but continued to release games for both arcade and home for another eight years   Measured from the introduction of the arcade hardware in 1990 to the release of the last official home cartridge in 2004  the Neo Geo enjoyed a primary software production lifespan of fourteen years  and a hardware production lifespan of seven years  On August 31  2007  SNK stopped offering maintenance and repairs to Neo Geo home consoles  handhelds  and games   2  Reception  In a 1993 review  GamePro gave the Neo Geo a  thumbs up   Though they voiced several criticisms  noting that the system was not as powerful as the soon to launch 3DO and had few releases which were not fighting games  they generally praised both the hardware and games library  and recommended that gamers who could not afford the console  which was still priced at $649 99  play the games in the arcade   In 2009  the Neo Geo was ranked 19th out of the 25 best video game consoles of all time by the video game website IGN   3  Technical details  Each joystick controller is 280mm  width  × 190mm  depth  × 95mm  height    11 × 8 × 2 5 in   and contains the same four button layout as the arcade MVS cabinet   The arcade machines have a memory card system by which a player could save a game to return to at a later time and could also be used to continue play on the SNK home console of the same name   The arcade version of the video game hardware is often referred to as the  MVS   or Multi Video System  available in 1 slot  2 slot  4 slot  and 6 slot variations  the latter being capable of up to six cartridges loaded into one machine   with its console counterpart referred to as the  AES   or Advanced Entertainment System  Early motherboard revisions contain daughterboards  used to enhance the clarity of the video output   The MVS and AES hardware can execute identical machine code  Owners can move EPROMs from one type to the other  and the game will still run  The program specifics for both MVS and AES game options are contained on every game ROM  whether the cartridge is intended for home or arcade use  However  the arcade and home cartridges do have a different pinout  They were designed this way to prevent arcade operators from buying the cheaper home carts and then using them in arcades  It has been found that in a few home version games  one could unlock the arcade version of the game by inputting a special code    ROM sizes and startup screens The original specification for ROM size is up to 330 megabits  hence the system displaying  MAX 330 MEGA PRO GEAR SPEC  upon startup  While no technical advances were required to achieve it  some games over 100 megabits  such as Top Hunter  followed this screen by displaying an animation proclaiming  THE 100MEGA SHOCK    The original ROM size specification was later enhanced on cartridges with bank switching memory technology  increasing the maximum cartridge size to around 716 megabits  These new cartridges also cause the system to display  GIGA POWER PRO GEAR SPEC  upon startup or during attract mode  indicating this enhancement  File

other video game consoles of its time  the Neo Geo does not use scrolling tilemap background layers  Instead  it has a single non scrolling tilemap layer called the fix layer  while any scrolling layers rely exclusively on drawing sprites to create the scrolling backgrounds  like the Sega Y Board   By laying multiple sprites side by side  the system can simulate a tilemap background layer  The

the mid 1990s  SNK was trying to move onto a new platform  notably the Hyper 64  A Hyper 64 game called  Fatal Fury  Wild Ambition  was ported to the PlayStation   The GameTap subscription service has included a Neo Geo emulator and a small library of Neo Geo games  In 2007 Nintendo announced that Neo Geo games would appear on the Wii s Virtual Console  starting with Fatal Fury  King of Fighters  Art of Fighting  and World Heroes  Neo Geo games are also available through Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network  including Fatal Fury Special  Samurai Shodown II  Metal Slug 3  Garou  Mark of the Wolves and The King of Fighters  98   Homebrew activity exists even since the console s discontinuation  both by noncommercial hobbyists and commercially   Neo Geo has a community of collectors  Because of the limited production runs received by cartridges amongst the sizable available arcade library  some of the rarest Neo Geo games can sell for well over $1 000  The most valuable game is the European AES version of Kizuna Encounter  The MVS market provides a cheaper alternative to the expensive and rare home cartridges  and complete arcade kits are priced at a premium   6  See also
