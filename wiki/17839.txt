The London Underground  also known as the Tube or simply the Underground  is a public rapid transit system serving a large part of Greater London and parts of the home counties of Buckinghamshire  Hertfordshire and Essex  The system serves 270 stations and has of track  52% of which is above ground  The network is considered the oldest rapid transit system  it incorporates the world s first underground railway  the Metropolitan Railway  which opened in 1863 and is now part of the Circle  Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines  and the first line to operate underground electric traction trains  the City & South London Railway in 1890  now part of the Northern line  The network has expanded to 11 lines  and in 2012 13 carried 1 23 billion passengers  making it the 12th busiest transit system   The system s first tunnels were built just below the surface using the cut and cover method  and are large enough to take trains of normal size  Later  smaller circular tunnels – which give rise to its nickname the Tube – were dug through the London Clay at a deeper level  The early lines were marketed as the UNDERGROUND in the early 20th century on maps and signs at central London stations  The private companies that owned and ran the railways were merged in 1933 to form the London Passenger Transport Board  The current operator  London Underground Limited  LUL   is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London  TfL   the statutory corporation responsible for most elements of the transport network in Greater London  The term  Tube  is nowadays often used both in official publicity and in general usage to embrace the whole Underground system  though it is sometimes only applied to the lines that run in deep level tunnels  excluding the Circle  Metropolitan  District and Hammersmith and City lines     91 per cent of operational expenditure is covered by passenger fares  The Travelcard ticket was introduced in 1983 and Oyster  a contactless ticketing system  in 2003   The LPTB was a prominent patron of art and design  commissioning many new station buildings  posters and public artworks in a modernist style  The schematic Tube map  designed by Harry Beck in 1931  was voted a national design icon in 2006 and now includes other lines   the Docklands Light Railway and London Overground   as well as the non rail Emirates Air Line  London Underground celebrated 150 years of operations in 2013  with various events marking the milestone   1  History  1 1  Origins  The idea of an underground railway linking the City of London with some of the railway termini in its urban centre was proposed in the 1830s  and the Metropolitan Railway was granted permission to build such a line in 1854  The world s first underground railway  it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives  It was hailed as a success  carrying 38 000 passengers on the opening day  and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service  The Metropolitan District Railway  commonly known as the District Railway  opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for an underground  inner circle  connecting London s main line termini  The Metropolitan and District railways completed the Circle line in 1884  built using the cut and cover method  Both railways expanded  the District building five branches to the west reaching Ealing  Hounslow  Uxbridge  Richmond and Wimbledon and the Metropolitan eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire  more than from Baker Street and the centre of London   For the first deep level tube line  the City and South London Railway  two diameter circular tunnels were dug between King William Street  close to today s Monument station  and Stockwell  under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface  This opened in 1890 with electric locomotives that hauled carriages with small opaque windows  nicknamed padded cells  The Waterloo and City Railway opened in 1898  followed by the Central London Railway in 1900  known as the  twopenny tube   These two ran electric trains in circular tunnels having diameters between and   whereas the Great Northern and City Railway  which opened in 1904  was built to take main line trains from Finsbury Park to a Moorgate terminus in the City and had diameter tunnels   In the early 20th century  the District and Metropolitan railways needed to electrify and a joint committee recommended an AC system  the two companies co operating because of the shared ownership of the inner circle  The District  needing to raise the finance necessary  found an investor in the American Charles Yerkes who favoured a DC system similar to that in use on the City & South London and Central London railways  The Metropolitan Railway protested about the change of plan  but after arbitration by the Board of Trade  the DC system was adopted  Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and established the Underground Electric Railways Company of London  UERL  in 1902 to finance and operate three tube lines  the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway  Bakerloo   the Charing Cross  Euston and Hampstead Railway  Hampstead  and the Great Northern  Piccadilly and Brompton Railway   Piccadilly   which all opened between 1906 and 1907  When the  Bakerloo  was so named in July 1906  The Railway Magazine called it an undignified  gutter title   By 1907 the District and Metropolitan Railways had electrified the underground sections of their lines   A joint marketing agreement between most of the companies in the early years of the 20th century included maps  joint publicity  through ticketing and UNDERGROUND signs outside stations in Central London  The Bakerloo line was extended north to Queen s Park to join a new electric line from Euston to Watford  but World War I delayed construction and trains reached in 1917  During air raids in 1915 people used the tube stations as shelters  An extension of the Central line east to Ealing was also delayed by the war and completed in 1920  After the war government backed financial guarantees were used to expand the network and the tunnels of the City and South London and Hampstead railways were linked at Euston and Kennington  although the combined service was not named the Northern line until later  The Metropolitan promoted housing estates near the railway with the  Metro land  brand and nine housing estates were built near stations on the line  Electrification was extended north from Harrow to Rickmansworth  and branches opened from Rickmansworth to Watford in 1925 and from Wembley Park to Stanmore in 1932  The Piccadilly line was extended north to Cockfosters and took over District line branches to Harrow  later Uxbridge  and Hounslow   1 2  London Transport  In 1933  London s underground railways  tramway and bus operators were merged to form the London Passenger Transport Board  which became known as London Transport  and Harry Beck s diagrammatic tube map appeared for the first time  The outlying lines of the former Metropolitan Railway closed  the Brill Tramway in 1935  and the line from Quainton Road to Verney Junction in 1936  The 1935–40 New Works Programme included the extension of the Central and Northern lines and the Bakerloo line to take over the Metropolitan s Stanmore branch  World War II suspended these plans after the Bakerloo line had reached Stanmore and the Northern line High Barnet and Mill Hill East in 1941  During the war many tube stations were used as air raid shelters  Following bombing in 1940 passenger services over the West London Line were suspended  leaving Olympia exhibition centre without a railway service until a District line shuttle from Earl s Court began after the war  After work restarted on the Central line extensions in east and west London  these were complete in 1949  After Britain s railways were nationalised in 1948 the reconstruction of the main line railways was given priority over the maintenance of the Underground and most of the unfinished plans of the pre war New Works Programme were shelved or postponed   However  the District line needed new trains and an unpainted aluminium train entered service in 1953  this becoming the standard for new trains  In the early 1960s the Metropolitan line was electrified as far as Amersham  British Rail providing services for the former Metropolitan line stations between Amersham and Aylesbury  The Victoria line was dug under central London and  unlike the earlier tubes  the tunnels did not follow the roads above  The line opened in 1968–71 with the trains being driven automatically and magnetically encoded tickets collected by automatic gates gave access to the platforms  In 1976 the isolated Northern City Line was taken over by British Rail and linked up with the main line railway at Finsbury Park  In 1979 another new tube  the Jubilee line  named in honour of Queen Elizabeth s Silver Jubilee  took over the Stanmore branch from the Bakerloo line and was extended through to the Docklands in 1999  Under the control of the Greater London Council  London Transport introduced a system of fare zones for buses and underground trains that cut the average fare in 1981  Fares increased following a legal challenge but the fare zones were retained  and in the mid 1980s the Travelcard and the Capitalcard were introduced  To comply with new safety regulations issued as a result of the King s Cross fire and to combat graffiti a train refurbishment project was launched in July 1991  In 1984 control of London Buses and the London Underground passed to London Regional Transport  LRT   which reported directly to Secretary of State for Transport  One person operation had been planned in 1968  but conflict with the trade unions delayed introduction until the 1980s   In the early years of the 21st century London Underground was reorganised in a Public Private Partnership where private infrastructure companies  infracos  upgraded and maintained the railway  In 2003 control passed to Transport for London  TfL  that had been opposed to the arrangement  One infraco went into administration in 2007 and TfL took over the responsibilities  TfL taking over the other in 2010  Electronic ticketing in the form of the contact less Oyster card was introduced in 2003  The East London line closed in 2007 so that it could be converted into a London Overground line  and in December 2009 the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London to a spiral also serving Hammersmith   1 3  Transport for London  Transport for London  TfL  was created in 2000 as the integrated body responsible for London s transport system  It replaced London Regional Transport  It assumed control of London Underground Limited in July 2003  TfL is part of the Greater London Authority and is constituted as a statutory corporation regulated under local government finance rules  It has three subsidiaries  London Transport Insurance  Guernsey  Ltd  TfL Trustee Company Ltd and Transport Trading Ltd  TTL   and London Underground Limited is a subsidiary of TTL  The TfL Board is appointed by the Mayor of London  The Mayor also sets the structure and level of public transport fares in London  However the day to day running of the corporation is left to the Commissioner of Transport for London  The current Commissioner is Peter Hendy  The Mayor is responsible for producing an integrated transport strategy for London and for consulting the GLA  TfL  local councils and others on the strategy  The Mayor is also responsible for setting TfL s budget  The GLA is consulted on the Mayor s transport strategy  and inspects and approves the Mayor s budget  It is able to summon the Mayor and senior staff to account for TfL s performance  London TravelWatch  a body appointed by and reporting to the Assembly  deals with complaints about transport in London   2  Infrastructure  2 1  Railway  The Underground serves 270 stations  Fourteen Underground stations are outside Greater London  of which five  Amersham  Chalfont & Latimer  Chesham  and Chorleywood on the Metropolitan line  and Epping on the Central line   are beyond the M25 London Orbital motorway  Of the 32 London boroughs  six  Bexley  Bromley  Croydon  Kingston  Lewisham and Sutton  are not served by the Underground network  while Hackney has Old Street and Manor House only just inside its boundaries  London Underground s eleven lines total in length  making it the third longest metro system in the world  These are made up of the sub surface network and the deep tube lines  The Circle  District  Hammersmith & City  and Metropolitan lines form the sub surface network  with railway tunnels just below the surface and of a similar size to those on British main lines  The Hammersmith & City and Circle lines share stations and most of their track with each other  as well as with the Metropolitan and District lines  The Bakerloo  Central  Jubilee  Northern  Piccadilly  Victoria and Waterloo & City lines are deep level tubes  with smaller trains that run in two circular tunnels  tubes  with a diameter about   These lines have the exclusive use of a pair of tracks  except for the Piccadilly line  which shares track with the District line between Acton Town and Hanger Lane Junction and with the Metropolitan line between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge  and the Bakerloo line  which shares track with London Overground services north of Queen s Park  Fifty five per cent of the system runs on the surface  and there are of cut and cover tunnel and of tube tunnel  Many of the central London underground stations on deep level tube lines are higher than the running lines to assist deceleration when arriving and acceleration when departing  Trains generally run on the left hand track  although in some places the tunnels are above each other  for example the Central line east of St Paul s station  or the running tunnels are on the right  for example on the Victoria line between Warren Street and King s Cross St  Pancras to allow cross platform interchange with the Northern line between northbound and southbound trains at Euston   The lines are electrified with a four rail DC system  a conductor rail between the rails is energised at −210 V and a rail outside the running rails at +420 V  giving a potential difference of 630 V  On the sections of line shared with mainline trains  such as the District line from East Putney to Wimbledon and Gunnersbury to Richmond  and the Bakerloo line north of Queen s Park  the centre rail is bonded to the running rails   2 2  Lines  2 3  Former main lines  The Underground uses a number of railways and alignments that were built by main line railway companies   Bakerloo line  Between Queen s Park and Harrow & Wealdstone this runs largely parallel to the London & North Western Railway  LNWR  main line that opened in 1837  The Bakerloo line route has always been segregated  and was laid out by the LNWR in 1912–15   Central line  The railway from just south of Leyton to just south of Loughton was built by Eastern Counties Railway in 1856 on the same alignment in use today  The Underground also uses the line built in 1865 by the Great Eastern Railway  GER  between Loughton to Ongar via Epping  The connection to the main line south of Leyton was closed in 1970 and removed in 1972  The line from Epping to Ongar was closed in 1994  most of the line is in use today by the heritage Epping Ongar Railway  The line between Newbury Park and Woodford junction  west of Roding Valley  via Hainault was built by the GER in 1903  the connections to the main line south of Newbury Park closing in 1947  in the Ilford direction  and 1956  in the Seven Kings direction    Central line  The line from just north of White City to Ealing Broadway was built in 1917 by the Great Western Railway  GWR  and passenger service introduced by the Underground in 1920  North Acton to West Ruislip was built by GWR on behalf of the Underground in 1947–8 as parallel line to the pre existing tracks from Old Oak Common junction towards and beyond  which date from 1904    the original Old Oak Common junction to route sees one main line train a day to from Paddington   District line  South of Kensington Olympia short sections of the 1862 West London Railway  WLR  and its 1863 West London Extension Railway  WLER  were used when District extended from Earl s Court in 1872  The District had its own bay platform at Olympia built in 1958 along with track on the bed of the 1862 3 WLR WLER northbound  Southbound WLR WLER became the new northbound main line at this time  and a new southbound main line track was built through site of former goods yard  The 1872 junction closed in 1958  while a further connection to the WLR just south of Olympia closed in 1992  and the branch is now segregated   District line  The line between Campbell Road junction  now closed   near Bromley by Bow  and Barking was built by the London  Tilbury & Southend Railway  LTSR  in 1858  The slow tracks were built 1903–05  when District services were extended from Bow Road  though there were no District services east of East Ham from 1905 to 1932   The slow tracks were shared with LTSR stopping and goods trains until segregated by 1962  when main line trains stopped serving intermediate stations   District line  The railway from Barking to Upminster was built by LTSR in 1885 and the District extended over the route in 1902  District withdrew between 1905 and 1932  when the route was quadrupled  Main line trains ceased serving intermediate stations in 1962  and the District line today only uses the 1932 slow tracks   District line  The westbound track between east of Ravenscourt Park and Turnham Green and Turnham Green to Gunnersbury follows the alignment of a railway built by the London & South Western Railway  LSWR  in 1869  Eastbound track between Turnham Green and east of Ravenscourt Park follows the alignment built in 1911  this was closed 1916 before being re used when the Piccadilly line was extended in 1932   District line  The line between East Putney and Wimbledon was built by the LSWR in 1889  The last regular main line service ran in 1941 but it still sees a few Waterloo services at the start and end of the daily timetable   Hammersmith & City  Between Paddington and Westbourne Park tube station  the line is parallel to the main line  The Great Western main line opened in 1838  serving a temporary terminus the other side of Bishop s Road and when the current Paddington station opened in 1854  the line passed to the south of the old station  On opening in 1864 the Hammersmith & City ran via the main line to a junction at Westbourne Park  until 1867 when two tracks opened to the south of the main line  with a crossing near Westbourne Bridge  Paddington  The current two tracks to the north of the main line and the subway east of Westbourne Park opened in 1878  The H & C route is now completely segregated from the main line   Jubilee line  The rail route Between Canning Town and Stratford was built by the GER in 1846 with passenger services starting in 1847  The original alignment was quadrupled  in stages between 1860 and 1892  for freight services before the extra  western  tracks were lifted as traffic declined during the 20th century  and were re laid for Jubilee line services that started in 1999  The current Docklands Light Railway  ex North London Line  uses the original eastern alignment and the Jubilee uses the western alignment   Northern line  The line from East Finchley to Mill Hill East was opened in 1867  and from Finchley Central to High Barnet in 1872  both by the Great Northern Railway   Piccadilly line  westbound track between east of Ravenscourt Park and Turnham Green built by LSWR in 1869  originally used for eastbound main line and District services  eastbound track built in 1911 and closed 1916 and re used when the Piccadilly line was extended in 1932   2 4  Main line routes currently sharing track with LUL  Bakerloo line   Queen s Park to Harrow & Wealdstone  shared with London Overground Euston to Watford Junction service  District line   Gunnersbury to Richmond  shared with London Overground North London Line  District line   East Putney to Wimbledon  shared with South West Trains services when diverted  Metropolitan line   Harrow on the Hill to Amersham  shared with Chiltern Railways Marylebone to Aylesbury service  2 5  Trains  London Underground trains come in two sizes  larger sub surface trains and smaller deep tube trains  Since the early 1960s all passenger trains have been electric multiple units with sliding doors and a train last ran with a guard in 2000  All lines use fixed length trains with between six and eight cars  except for the Waterloo & City line that uses four cars  New trains are designed for maximum number of standing passengers and for speed of access to the cars and have regenerative braking and public address systems  Since 1999 all new stock has had to comply with accessibility regulations that require such things as access and room for wheelchairs  and the size and location of door controls  All underground trains are required to comply with the The Rail Vehicle Accessibility  Non Interoperable Rail System  Regulations 2010  RVAR 2010  by 2020   Stock on sub surface lines is identified by a letter  such as S Stock  used on the Metropolitan line   while tube stock is identified by the year of intended introduction  for example  1996 Stock  used on the Jubilee line    2 6  Ventilation and cooling  When the Bakerloo line opened in 1906 it was advertised with a maximum temperature of   but over time the tube tunnels have warmed up  In 1938 approval was given for a ventilation improvement programme  and a refrigerating unit was installed in a lift shaft at Tottenham Court Road  More recently  temperatures of were reported in the 2006 European heat wave  It was pointed out in 2002 that  if animals were being transported  temperatures on the Tube would break European Commission animal welfare laws  A 2000 study reported that air quality was seventy three times worse than at street level  with a passenger breathing the same mass of particulates during a twenty minute journey on the Northern line as smoking a cigarette  The main purpose of the London Underground s ventilation fans is to extract hot air from the tunnels  and fans across the network are being refurbished  although complaints of noise from local residents preclude their use at full power at night   In June 2006 a groundwater cooling system was installed at Victoria station  In 2012  air cooling units were installed on platforms at Green Park station using cool deep groundwater and at Oxford Circus using chiller units at the top of an adjacent building  New air conditioned trains are being introduced on the sub surface lines  but space is limited on tube trains for air conditioning units and these would heat the tunnels even more  The Deep Tube Programme  investigating replacing the trains for the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines  is looking for trains with better energy conservation and regenerative braking  on which it might be possible to install a form of air conditioning   2 7  Lifts and escalators  Originally access to the deep tube platforms was by a lift  Each lift was manned  and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift  or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office  The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl s Court and from the following year new deep level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts  The escalators had a diagonal shunt at the top landing  In 1921 a recorded voice instructed passengers to stand on the right and signs followed in World War II  Travellers were asked to stand on the right so that anyone wishing to overtake them at the end would have an extra section of moving stairway  The first  comb  type escalator was installed in 1924 at Clapham Common  In the 1920s and 1930s many lifts were replaced by escalators   There are 426 escalators on the London Underground system and the longest  at   is at Angel  The shortest  at Stratford  gives a vertical rise of   There are 164 lifts  and numbers have increased in recent years due to a programme to increase accessibility   2 8  Wi Fi and mobile phone reception  In summer 2012 London Underground  in partnership with Virgin Media  tried out Wi Fi hot spots in many stations  but not in the tunnels  that allowed passengers free internet access  The free trial proved successful and was extended to the end of 2012 whereupon it switched to a service freely available to subscribers to Virgin Media and others  or as a paid for service  Even without subscribing to paid for Wi Fi services  the free signals can be used by smartphones to alert a traveller that they have arrived at a specific station  It is not currently possible to use mobile phones underground using native 2G  3G or 4G networks  and a project to extend coverage before the 2012 Olympics was abandoned due to commercial and technical difficulties  UK subscribers on the O2 or Three mobile networks can use the Tu Go or InTouch apps respectively to route their voice calls and texts messages via the Virgin Media Wifi network at 138 London Transport stations  The EE network expects to release a WiFi calling app in the near future   3  Proposed improvements and expansions  3 1  New lines  Crossrail is under construction and expected to open in 2018  providing a new underground route across central London integrated with  but not part of the London Underground system  Two options are being considered for the route of Crossrail 2 on a north south alignment across London  with hopes that it could be open by 2033   3 2  Line extensions  3 2 1  Croxley Rail Link  The Croxley Rail Link involves re routing the Metropolitan line s Watford branch from the current terminus at Watford over part of the disused Croxley Green branch line to with stations at Cassiobridge  Watford Vicarage Road and   Funding was agreed in December 2011  and the final approval for the extension was given on 24 July 2013  Construction work is expected to start in early 2015 and to be completed in 2018   3 2 2  Northern line extension to Battersea  It is planned that the Northern line be extended to Battersea with an intermediate station at Nine Elms  In December 2012  the Treasury confirmed that it will provide a guarantee that allows the Greater London Authority to borrow up to £1 billion from the Public Works Loan Board  at a preferential rate  to finance the construction of the line  In April 2013  Transport for London applied for the legal powers of a Transport and Works Act Order to proceed with the extension  with a decision expected in the summer of 2013  The stations could open in 2020   3 2 3  Bakerloo line extension to Lewisham or Hayes via Camberwell or Old Kent Road  In 1931 the extension of the Bakerloo line from Elephant & Castle to Camberwell was approved  with stations at Albany Road and an interchange at   However  with post war austerity  the plan was abandoned  In 2006 Ken Livingstone  the then Mayor of London  announced that within twenty years Camberwell would have a tube station  Transport for London has indicated that extensions  possibly to Camberwell  could play a part in the future transport strategy for South London over the coming years  However  no such planning of an extension has been revealed  There have also been many other proposals to extend the line to Streatham  Lewisham  and even beyond Lewisham  taking over the suburban Hayes line via Catford Bridge to relieve some capacity on the suburban rail network   3 2 4  Bakerloo line extension to Watford Junction  TfL has proposed re extending the Bakerloo line to   It has been suggested that most or all of the line from to Watford Junction would be used exclusively by the London Underground  and London Overground services would be withdrawn   3 2 5  Central line extension to Uxbridge  The London Borough of Hillingdon has proposed that the Central line be extended from West Ruislip to Uxbridge via Ickenham  claiming this would cut traffic on the A40 in the area   3 3  Infrastructure  The signalling system on the Northern line is being replaced to increase capacity on the line by 20 per cent by the end of 2014  Capacity can be increased further if the operation of the Charing Cross and Bank branches are separated  New S Stock trains are being introduced on the sub surface  District  Metropolitan  Hammersmith & City and Circle  lines  and the track  electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme to increase peak hour capacity  which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2018  A control room for the sub surface network has been built in Hammersmith and an automatic train control  ATC  system is to replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s  Bombardier won the contact in June 2011  but was released by agreement in December 2013 and London Underground are looking for a new contractor  Options for new trains for the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines are being considered   3 4  New trains for deep level lines  In Summer 2014 Transport for London issued a tender for up to 18 trains for the Jubilee line and up to 50 trains for the Northern line  These would be used to increase frequencies and cover the Battersea extension on the Northern line   In early 2014 the Bakerloo  Piccadilly  Central and Waterloo & City line rolling stock replacement project was renamed New Tube for London  NTfL  and moved from its feasibility stage to the design and specification stage  The study had showed that new generation trains and re signalling   Piccadilly line capacity could be increased by 60 per cent with 33 trains per hour  tph  at peak times by 2025   Central line capacity increased by 25 per cent with 33 tph at peak times by 2030   Waterloo & City line capacity increased by 50 per cent by 2032  after the track at Waterloo station was remodelled   Bakerloo line capacity could be increased by 25 per cent with 27 tph at peak times by 2033  The project is estimated to cost £16 42 billon  £9 86 bn at 2013 prices   A notice was published on 28 February 2014 in the Official Journal of the European Union asking for expressions of interest in building the trains  On 9 October 2014 TFL published a shortlist of those  Alstom  Siemens  Hitachi  CAF and Bombardier  who had expressed an interest in supplying 250 trains for between £1 0 billion and £2 5 billion  and on the same day opened an exhibition with a design by PriestmanGoode  The fully automated trains may be able to run without drivers  however the ASLEF and RMT trade unions that represent the drivers strongly oppose this  saying it would affect safety  The Invitation to Tender for the trains is expected in early 2015  the specifications for the Piccadilly line infrastructure in 2016  and the first train to run on the Piccadilly line in 2022   4  Travelling  4 1  Ticketing  The Underground uses Transport for London s zonal fare system to calculate fares  There are nine zones  zone 1 being the central zone  which includes the loop of the Circle line with a few stations to the south of River Thames  The only London Underground stations in Zones 7 to 9 are on the Metropolitan line beyond Moor Park  outside Greater London  Some stations are in two zones  and the cheapest fare applies  Paper tickets or the contactless Oyster card can be used for travel  Single and return tickets are available in either format  but Travelcards  season tickets  for longer than a day are available only on Oyster cards   TfL introduced the Oyster card in 2003  this is a pre payment smartcard with an embedded contactless RFID chip  It can be loaded with Travelcards and used on the Underground  the Overground  buses  trams  the Docklands Light Railway  and National Rail services within London  Fares for single journeys are cheaper than paper tickets  and a daily cap limits the total cost in a day to the price of a Day Travelcard  The Oyster card must be  touched in  at the start and end of a journey  otherwise it is regarded as  incomplete  and the maximum fare charged  In March 2012 the cost of this in the previous year to travellers was £66 5 million  Contactless payment cards can be used instead of an Oyster card on buses  and this will be extended to London Underground  London Overground  DLR and most National Rail services in London from 16 September 2014   A concessionary fare scheme is operated by London Councils for residents who are disabled or meet certain age criteria  Residents born before 1951 were eligible after their 60th birthday  whereas those born in 1955 will need to wait until they are 66  Called a  Freedom Pass  it allows free travel on TfL operated routes at all times and is valid on some National Rail services within London at weekends and after 09 30 on Monday to Fridays  Since 2010  the Freedom Pass has included an embedded holder s photograph  it lasts five years between renewals   In addition to automatic and staffed ticket gates  the Underground is patrolled by both uniformed and plain clothes ticket inspectors with hand held Oyster card readers  Passengers travelling without a valid ticket must pay a penalty fare of £80  or £40 if paid within 21 days  and can be prosecuted for fare evasion under the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 and Transport for London Byelaws   4 2  Hours of operation  The tube closes overnight  the first trains running from about 05 00 to just after 01 00 the following morning  with later starting times at weekends  The nightly closures are used for maintenance  but some lines stay open at New Year and close later during major public events such as the 2012 London Olympics  London Underground are planning to run a 24 hour service on Friday and Saturday nights on some lines at the weekend from September 2015  following completion of upgrades  Some lines are closed for scheduled engineering work at weekends to update the system   The Underground runs limited service on Christmas Eve with some lines closing early  and does not operate on Christmas Day  Since 2010 a dispute between London Underground and trade unions over holiday pay has resulted in a limited service on Boxing Day   4 3  Accessibility  Accessibility by people with limited mobility was not considered when most of the system was built  and before 1993 fire regulations prohibited wheelchairs on the underground  The stations on the Jubilee Line Extension  opened in 1999  were designed for accessibility  but retrofitting accessibility features to the older stations is a major investment that is planned to take over twenty years  A 2010 London Assembly Report concluded that over ten per cent of the people of London had reduced mobility and  with an ageing population  numbers will increase in the future   TfL produces a version of the tube map that indicates stations that are step free from street to platforms  There can also be a step from platform to train as large as and a gap between the train and curved platforms  and these distances are marked on the map  Access from platform to train at some stations can be assisted using a boarding ramp operated by staff  and a section has been raised on some platforms to reduce the step   there are 66 stations with step free access from platform to train  and there are plans to provide step free access at another 28 in ten years  By 2016 a third of stations are to have platform humps that reduce the step from platform to train  New trains  such as those being introduced on the sub surface network  have access and room for wheelchairs  improved audio and visual information systems and accessible door controls   4 4  Delays and overcrowding  During peak hours  stations can get so crowded that they need to be closed  Passengers may not get on the first train and the majority of passengers do not find a seat on their trains  some trains having more than four passengers every square metre  When asked  passengers report overcrowding as the aspect of the network that they are least satisfied with  and overcrowding has been linked to poor productivity and potential poor heart health  Capacity increases have been overtaken by increased demand  and peak overcrowding has increased by 16 per cent since 2004 5   Compared with 2003 4  the reliability of the network had increased in 2010 11  with Lost Customer Hours reduced from 54 million to 40 million  Passengers are entitled to a refund if their journey is delayed by 15 minutes or more due to circumstances within the control of TfL  and in 2010  330 000 passengers of a potential 11 million Tube passengers claimed compensation for delays  A number of mobile phone apps and services have been developed to help passengers claim their refund more efficiently   4 5  Safety  London Underground is authorised to operate trains by the Office of Rail Regulation  and the latest Safety Certification and Safety Authorisation is valid until 2017  there had been 310 days since the last major incident  when a passenger had died after falling on the track   In November 2011 it was reported that 80 people had committed suicide in the previous year on the London Underground  up from 46 in 2000  Most platforms at deep tube stations have pits  often referred to as  suicide pits   beneath the track  These were constructed in 1926 to aid drainage of water from the platforms  but halve the likelihood of a fatality when a passenger falls or jumps in front of a train   5  Design and the arts  5 1  Map  Early maps of the Metropolitan and District railways were city maps with the lines superimposed  and the District published a pocket map in 1897  A Central London Railway route diagram appears on a 1904 postcard and 1905 poster  similar maps appearing in District Railway cars in 1908  In the same year  following a marketing agreement between the operators  a joint central area map that included all the lines was published  A new map was published in 1921 without any background details  but the central area was squashed  requiring smaller letters and arrows  Harry Beck had the idea of expanding this central area  distorting geography  and simplifying the map so that the railways appeared as straight lines with equally spaced stations  He presented his original draft in 1931  and after initial rejection it was first printed in 1933  Today s tube map is an evolution of that original design  and the ideas are used by many metro systems around the world   Currently the standard tube map shows the Docklands Light Railway  London Overground and Emirates Air Line as well as the London Underground  a more detailed map covering a larger area  published by National Rail and Transport for London  includes London Tramlink and suburban railway services  The tube map came second in a BBC and London Transport Museum poll asking for a favourite UK design icon of the 20th century and the underground s 150th anniversary was celebrated by a Google Doodle on the search engine   5 2  Roundel  While the first use of a roundel in a London transport context was the trademark of the London General Omnibus Company registered in 1905  it was first used on the Underground in 1908 when the UERL placed a solid red circle behind station nameboards on platforms to highlight the name  The word  UNDERGROUND  was placed in a roundel instead of a station name on posters in 1912 by Charles Sharland and Alfred France  as well as on undated and possibly earlier posters from the same period  Frank Pick thought the solid red disc cumbersome and took a version where the disc became a ring from a 1915 Sharland poster and gave it to Edward Johnston to develop  and registered the symbol as a trademark in 1917  The roundel was first printed on a map cover using the Johnston typeface in June 1919  and printed in colour the following October   After the UERL was absorbed into the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933  it used forms of the roundel for buses  trams and coaches  as well as the Underground  The words  London Transport  were added inside the ring  above and below the bar  The Carr Edwards report  published in 1938 as possibly the first attempt at a graphics standards manual  introduced stricter guidelines  Between 1948 and 1957 the word  Underground  in the bar was replaced by  London Transport     forms of the roundel  with differing colours for the ring and bar  is used for other TfL services  such as London Buses  Tramlink  London Overground  London River Services and Docklands Light Railway  Crossrail  due to open in 2018  is to be identified with a roundel  The 100th anniversary of the roundel was celebrated in 2008 by TfL commissioning 100 artists to produce works that celebrate the design   5 3  Architecture  Seventy of the 270 London Underground stations use buildings that are on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest  and five have entrances in listed buildings  The Metropolitan Railway s original seven stations were inspired by Italianate designs  with the platforms lit by daylight from above and by gas lights in large glass globes  Early District Railway stations were similar and on both railways the further from central London the station the simpler the construction  The City & South London Railway opened with red brick buildings  designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis  topped with a lead covered dome that contained the lift mechanism  The Central London Railway appointed Harry Bell Measures as architect  who designed its pinkish brown steel framed buildings with larger entrances  In the first decade of the 20th century Leslie Green established a house style for the tube stations built by the UERL  which were clad in ox blood faience blocks  Green pioneered using building design to guide passengers with direction signs on tiled walls  with the stations given a unique identity with patterns on the platform walls  Many of these tile patterns survive  though a significant number of these are now replicas  Harry W  Ford was responsible for the design of at least 17 UERL and District Railway stations  including Barons Court and Embankment  and claimed to have first thought of enlarging the U and D in the UNDERGROUND wordmark  The Met s architect Charles Walter Clark had used a neo classical design for rebuilding Baker Street and Paddington Praed Street stations before World War I and  although the fashion had changed  continued with Farringdon in 1923  The buildings had metal lettering attached to pale walls  Clark would later design  Chiltern Court   the large  luxurious block of apartments at Baker Street  that opened in 1929  In the 1920s and 1930s  Charles Holden designed a series of modernist and art deco stations some of which he described as his  brick boxes with concrete lids   Holden s design for the Underground s headquarters building at 55 Broadway included avant garde sculptures by Jacob Epstein  Eric Gill and Henry Moore   When the Central line was extended east  the stations were simplified Holden proto Brutalist designs  and a cavernous concourse built at Gants Hill in honour of early Moscow Metro stations  Few new stations were built in the 50 years after 1948  but Misha Black was appointed design consultant for the 1960s Victoria line  contributing to the line s uniform look  but each station had an individual tile motif  Notable stations from this period include Moor Park  the stations of the Piccadilly line extensions to Heathrow and Hillingdon  The stations of the 1990s extension of the Jubilee line were much larger than before and designed by architects such as Norman Foster and Michael Hopkins   Many platforms have unique interior designs to help passenger identification  The tiling at Baker Street incorporates repetitions of Sherlock Holmes s silhouette and at Tottenham Court Road semi abstract mosaics by Eduardo Paolozzi feature musical instruments  tape machines and butterflies  Robyn Denny designed the murals on the Northern line platforms at Embankment   5 4  Typography  The first posters used a number of type fonts  as was contemporary practice  and station signs used sans serif block capitals  The Johnston typeface was developed in upper and lower case in 1916  and a complete set of blocks  marked Johnston Sans  was made by the printers the following year  A bold version of the capitals was developed by Johnston in 1929  The Met changed to a serif letterform for its signs in the 1920s  used on the stations rebuilt by Clark  However  Johnston was adopted systemwide after the formation the LPTB in 1933 and the LT wordmark was applied to locomotives and carriages  Johnston was redesigned  becoming New Johnston  for photo typesetting in the early 1980s when Elichi Kono designed a range that included Light  Medium and Bold  each with its italic version  The typesetters P22 developed today s electronic version  sometimes called TfL Johnston  in 1997   5 5  Posters and patron of the arts  Early advertising posters proclaimed the advantages of travelling using various letter forms  Graphic posters first appeared in the 1890s  and it became possible to print colour images economically in the early 20th century  The Central London Railway used colour illustrations in their 1905 poster  and from 1908 the underground group  under Pick s direction  used images of country scenes  shopping and major events on posters to encourage use of the tube  Pick found he was limited by the commercial artists the printers used  and so commissioned work from artists and designers such as Dora Batty  Edward McKnight Kauffer  the cartoonist George Morrow  Herry  Heather  Perry  Graham Sutherland  Charles Sharland and the sisters Anna and Doris Zinkeisen  According to Ruth Artmonsky  over 150 women artists were commissioned by Pick and latterly Christian Barman to design posters for London Underground  London Transport and London County Council Tramways  The Johnson Sans letter form began appearing on posters from 1917  The Met  strongly independent  used images on timetables and on the cover of its Metro land guide that promoted the country it served for the walker  visitor and later the house hunter  By the time London Transport was formed in 1933 the UERL was considered a patron of the arts and over 1000 works were commissioned in the 1930s  such as the cartoon images of Charles Burton and Kauffer s later abstract cubist and surrealist images   Harold Hutchison became London Transport publicity officer in 1947  after World War II and nationalisation  and introduced the  pair poster   where an image on a poster was paired with text on another  Numbers of commissions dropped  to eight a year in the 1950s and just four a year in the 1970s  with images from artists such Harry Stevens and Tom Eckersley  Art on the Underground was introduced in 1986 by Henry Fitzhugh to revive London Transport as a patron of the arts with the Underground commissioning six works a year  judged first on artistic merit  In that year Peter Lee  Celia Lyttleton and a poster by David Booth  Malcolm Fowler and Nancy Fowler were commissioned  Today commissions range from the pocket tube map cover to installations in a station  Similarly  Poems on the Underground has commissioned poetry since 1986 that are displayed in carriages   5 6  In popular culture  The Underground  including several fictitious stations  has been featured in many movies and television shows  including Skyfall  Die Another Day  Sliding Doors  An American Werewolf in London  Creep  Tube Tales and Neverwhere  The London Underground Film Office received over 200 requests to film in 2000  The Underground has also featured in music such as The Jam s  Down in the Tube Station at Midnight  and in literature such as the graphic novel V for Vendetta  Popular legends about the Underground being haunted persist to this day   Call of Duty  Modern Warfare 3 has a level named Underground where most of the level takes place between the dockyards and Westminster while the player and a team of SAS attempt to take down cargo being shipped using London Underground  The London Underground map serves as a playing field for the conceptual game of Mornington Crescent  which is named after a station on the Northern line  and the board game The London Game   5 7  In literature  London Underground Aldgate tube station plays an important role in the Sherlock Holmes story The Adventure of the Bruce Partington Plans  published in the anthology His Last Bow    6  Notable people  Charles Pearson  1793–1862  suggested an underground railway in London in 1845 and from 1854 promoted a scheme that eventually became the Metropolitan Railway   John Fowler  1817–1898  was the railway engineer that designed the Metropolitan Railway   Edward Watkin  1819–1901  was chairman of the Metropolitan Railway from 1872 to 1894   James Henry Greathead  1844–1896  was the engineer that dug the Tower Subway using a method using a wrought iron shield patented by Peter W  Barlow  and later used the same tunnelling shield to build the deep tube London & South London and Central London railways   Charles Yerkes  1837–1905  was an American who founded the Underground Electric Railways Company of London  UERL  in 1902  which opened three tube lines and electrified the District Railway   Edgar Speyer  1862–1932  Financial backer of Yerkes who served as UERL chairman from 1906 to 1915 during its formative years   Albert Stanley  1874–1948  was manager of the UERL from 1907  and became the first chairman of the London Passenger Transport Board  LPTB  in 1933   Frank Pick  1878–1941  was UERL publicity officer from 1908  commercial manager from 1912 and joint managing director from 1928  He was chief executive and vice chairman of the LPTB from 1933 to 1940  It was Pick that commissioned Edward Johnston to create the typeface and redesign the roundel  and established the Underground s reputation as patrons of the arts as users of the best in contemporary poster art and architecture   Robert Selbie  1868–1930  was manager of the Metropolitan Railway from 1908 until his death  marketing it using the Metro land brand   Edward Johnston  1872–1944  developed the Johnston Sans typeface  still in use today on the London Underground   Harry Beck  1902–1974  designed the tube map  named in 2006 as a British design icon   MacDonald Gill  1884–1947   cartographer credited with drawing  in 1914   the map that saved the London Underground    7  See also  List of busiest London Underground stations  List of London
