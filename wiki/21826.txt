In philosophical ethics  the term  naturalistic fallacy  was introduced by British philosopher G  E  Moore in his 1903 book Principia Ethica  Moore argues it would be fallacious to explain that which is good reductively in terms of natural properties such as  pleasant  or  desirable    Moore s naturalistic fallacy is closely related to the is–ought problem  which comes from Hume s Treatise  However  unlike Hume s view of the is–ought problem  Moore  and other proponents of ethical non naturalism  did not consider the naturalistic fallacy to be at odds with moral realism   The naturalistic fallacy should not be confused with a fallacious appeal to nature  a mistaken claim that something is good or right because it is natural  or bad or wrong because it is unnatural    1  Different common uses  1 1  The is–ought problem  The term  naturalistic fallacy  is sometimes used to describe the deduction of an  ought  from an  is   the Is–ought problem    In using his categorical imperative Kant deduced that experience was necessary for their application  But experience on its own or the imperative on its own could not possibly identify an act as being moral or immoral  We can have no certain knowledge of morality from them  being incapable of deducing how things ought to be from the fact that they happen to be arranged in a particular manner in experience   Bentham  in discussing the relations of law and morality  found that when people discuss problems and issues they talk about how they wish it would be as opposed to how it actually is  This can be seen in discussions of natural law and positive law  Bentham criticized natural law theory because in his view it was a naturalistic fallacy  claiming that it described how things ought to be instead of how things are   1 2  Moore s discussion  According to G  E  Moore s Principia Ethica  when philosophers try to define  good  reductively in terms of natural properties like  pleasant  or  desirable   they are committing the naturalistic fallacy   In defense of ethical non naturalism  Moore s argument is concerned with the semantic and metaphysical underpinnings of ethics  In general  opponents of ethical naturalism reject ethical conclusions drawn from natural facts   Moore argues that good  in the sense of intrinsic value  is simply ineffable  it cannot be defined because it is not a natural property  being  one of those innumerable objects of thought which are themselves incapable of definition  because they are the ultimate terms by reference to which whatever is capable of definition must be defined   On the other hand  ethical naturalists eschew such principles in favor of a more empirically accessible analysis of what it means to be good  for example  in terms of pleasure in the context of hedonism   In   Moore argues that a property is either a complex of simple properties  or else it is irreducibly simple  Complex properties can be defined in terms of their constituent parts but a simple property has no parts  In addition to  good  and  pleasure   Moore suggests that colour qualia are undefined  if one wants to understand yellow  one must see examples of it  It will do no good to read the dictionary and learn that  yellow  names the colour of egg yolks and ripe lemons  or that  yellow  names the primary colour between green and orange on the spectrum  or that the perception of yellow is stimulated by electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of between 570 and 590 nanometers  because yellow is all that and more  by the open question argument   Bernard Williams called Moore s use of the term  naturalistic fallacy  a  spectacular misnomer   the question being metaphysical  as opposed to rational   1 3  Appeal to nature  Some people use the phrase  naturalistic fallacy  or  appeal to nature  to characterize inferences of the form  This behaviour is natural  therefore  this behaviour is morally acceptable  or  This property is unnatural  therefore  this property is undesireable   Such inferences are common in discussions of homosexuality  environmentalism and veganism   2  Criticism  Some philosophers reject the naturalistic fallacy and or suggest solutions for the proposed is ought problem   Sam Harris argues that it is possible to derive  ought  from  is   and even that it has already been done to some extent  He sees morality as a budding science  This view is critical of Moore s  simple indefinable terms   which amount to qualia   arguing instead that such terms actually can be broken down into constituents   Ralph McInerny suggests that  ought  is already bound up in  is   in so far as the very nature of things have ends goals within them  For example  a clock is a device used to keep time  When one understands the function of a clock  then a standard of evaluation is implicit in the very description of the clock  i e   because it  is  a clock  it  ought  to keep the time  Thus  if one cannot pick a good clock from a bad clock  then one does not really know what a clock is  In like manner  if one cannot determine good human action from bad  then one does not really know what the human person is   Certain uses of the naturalistic fallacy refutation  a scheme of reasoning that declares an inference invalid because it incorporates an instance of the naturalistic fallacy  have been criticised as lacking rational bases  and labelled anti naturalistic fallacy  For instance  Alex Walter wrote   The refutations from naturalistic fallacy defined as inferring evaluative conclusions from purely factual premises do assert  implicitly  that there is no connection between the facts and the norms  in particular  between the facts and the mental process that led to adoption of the norms   which – at best – is an unproven hypothesis  except  perhaps  for purely dogmatic norms that the anti naturalistic fallacy has all the appearances of   3  See also  Appeal to nature  Appeal to novelty  Appeal
