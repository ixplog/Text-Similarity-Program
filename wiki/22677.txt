An oxymoron  plural oxymora or oxymorons  is a figure of speech that juxtaposes elements that appear to be contradictory  Oxymora appear in a variety of contexts  including inadvertent errors  such as  ground pilot   and literary oxymorons crafted to reveal a paradox   1  Types  The most common form of oxymoron involves an adjective–noun combination of two words  For example  the following line from Tennyson s Idylls of the King contains two oxymora   Other examples of oxymora of this kind include   Dark light  Living dead  but has been used for a type of supernatural being   Guest host  also  Permanent guest host   Crazy wisdom  Mournful optimist  Violent relaxation  but has been used as a technical term in development of galaxies  Less often seen are noun–verb combinations of two words  such as the line  The silence whistles  from Nathan Alterman s  Summer Night   or in a song title like Simon & Garfunkel s  The Sound of Silence    Oxymora are not always a pair of words  they can also be devised in the meaning of sentences or phrases   2  Etymology  Oxymoron is derived from the 5th century Latin oxymoron  which is derived from the  sharp  keen  and  dull  stupid   making the word itself an oxymoron  However  the combined Greek form ὀξύμωρον  oxumōron  does not in fact appear in the extant Greek sources   3  Taxonomy  Richard Lederer assembled a taxonomy of oxymora in an article in Word Ways in 1990  running from single word oxymora such as  pianoforte   literally   soft loud   through  doublespeak oxymora   deliberately intended to confuse  and  opinion oxymora   editorial opinions designed to provoke a laugh   In general  oxymora can be divided into expressions that were deliberately crafted to be contradictory and those phrases that inadvertently or incidentally contain a contradiction  often as a result of a punning use of one or both words   4  Apparent oxymora  Many oxymora have been popularised in vernacular speech  Examples include  controlled chaos    open secret    organized mess    alone in a crowd   and  accidentally on purpose    There are also examples in which terms that are superficially contradictory are juxtaposed in such a way that there is no contradiction  Examples include  same difference    jumbo shrimp   and  hot ice   where  hot  means  stolen  and  ice  means  diamonds   in criminal argot    5  Oxymora as paradoxes  Writers often use an oxymoron to call attention to an apparent contradiction  For example  Wilfred Owen s poem  The Send off  refers to soldiers leaving for the front line  who  lined the train with faces grimly gay   The oxymoron  grimly gay  highlights the contradiction between how the soldiers feel and how they act  though they put on a brave face and act cheerfully  they feel grim   One case where many oxymora are strung together can be found in Shakespeare s Romeo and Juliet  where Romeo declares   Some paradoxical oxymora become clichés   Deafening silence  Dry drunk  Forward retreat  Irregular pattern  Quiet riot  Serious joke  Sweet sorrow  6  Terms falsely called oxymora for rhetorical effect  Although a true oxymoron is  something that is surprisingly true  a paradox   Garry Wills has argued that modern usage has brought a common misunderstanding that  oxymoron  is nearly synonymous with  contradiction   The introduction of this misuse  the opposite of its true meaning  has been credited to William F  Buckley   Sometimes a pair of terms is claimed to be an oxymoron by those who hold the opinion that the two are mutually exclusive  That is  although there is no inherent contradiction between the terms  the speaker expresses the opinion that the two terms imply properties or characteristics that cannot occur together  Such claims may be made purely for humorous effect  Comedian George Carlin popularized many examples  such as  military intelligence    freedom fighters   and  business ethics   Another example is the term  civil war   which is not an oxymoron  but can be claimed to be so for humorous effect  if  civil  is construed as meaning  polite  rather than  between citizens of the same state   Alternatively  such claims may reflect a genuinely held opinion or ideological position  Well known examples include claims made against  government worker    honest broker    educational television    Microsoft Works   and  working from home    7  Visual and physical oxymora  In his book More on Oxymoron  the artist Patrick Hughes discusses and gives examples of visual oxymorons  He writes   Examples include waves in the sand  a fossil tree  and topiary representing something solid like an ocean liner  Hughes lists further examples of oxymoronic objects  including   Artificial grass  Bricked up windows  Ceramic eggs to persuade hens to lay  Electric candles  Floating soap  Invisible ink  Joke rubber coat hooks  Plastic glass  for drinking   Plastic lemons  Rubber bones for dogs  Solid water  ice   Solid wooden bottle moulds  Wax fruit  8  Other languages  Oxymora  in the sense of  single word oxymora  such as  pianoforte   are very common in Chinese and neighboring languages such as Japanese  and consist of two opposing Chinese characters  Archetypal examples include 男女  man and woman  male and female  gender   陰陽  yin and yang   善悪  good and evil  morality   and are used to indicate couples  ranges  or the trait that these are extremes of   9  See also  Auto antonym  Colorless green ideas sleep furiously  Contradictio in terminis  Irony  Paradox  Performative contradiction  Pleonasm  Retronym  some
