The Pittsburgh Pirates are a Major League Baseball  MLB  club based in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  They compete in the Central Division of the National League  NL   and play their home games at PNC Park  formerly at Forbes Field and Three Rivers Stadium  the latter s name is derived from the three rivers the Allegheny and the Monongahela  which join together to form the Ohio River   Founded on October 15  1881 as Allegheny  the franchise has won five World Series championships  The Pirates are also often referred to as the  Bucs  or the  Buccos   derived from buccaneer  a synonym for pirate    The franchise joined the NL in its eighth season in 1887 and was competitive from its early years  winning three NL titles from 1901 to 1903  playing in the very first World Series in 1903 and winning their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner  The Pirates have had many ups and downs during their long history  most famously winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a game winning home run by Bill Mazeroski  the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run  still to this day  They also won the 1971 World Series with Roberto Clemente and the 1979 World Series under the slogan  We Are Family   led by  Pops  Willie Stargell  Overall the Pirates have won five World Series and lost two   After a run of regular season success in the early 1990s  winning three straight East Division titles   the Pirates struggled over the following 20 years  with 20 consecutive losing seasons—the longest such streak in North American professional sports history—before posting a winning record in 2013 of 94–68 to qualify for the NL Wild Card before advancing to the NL Division Series round where they lost in 5 games to the St  Louis Cardinals   1  Franchise history  Professional baseball has been played in the Pittsburgh area since 1876  The teams of the era were  independents   barnstorming throughout the region and not affiliated with any organized league  though they did have salaries and were run as business organizations  On October 15  1881  the strongest team in the area joined the American Association as a founding member to begin play in 1882  Their various home fields in the 19th century were in a then separate city called Allegheny City  across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh  The team was listed as  Allegheny  in the standings  and was sometimes called the  Alleghenys   not the  Alleghenies   in the same generic way that teams from Boston  New York  and Chicago were sometimes called the  Bostons   the  New Yorks   and the  Chicagos   in the sports writing style of that era  After five mediocre seasons in the A A   Pittsburgh became the first A A  team to switch to the older National League in 1887  At this time  the team renamed itself the Pittsburgh Alleghenys  although Allegheny remained a separate city until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907  At that time  owner manager Horace Phillips sold the team to Dennis McKnight  Phillips stayed on as manager   Before the 1890 season  nearly all of the Alleghenys  best players bolted to the Players League s Pittsburgh Burghers  The Players  League collapsed after the season  and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs  However  the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer  who had previously played with the AA s Philadelphia Athletics  Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list  they loudly protested the Alleghenys  move  In an official complaint  an AA official claimed the Alleghenys  signing of Bierbauer was  piratical   This incident  which is discussed at some length in The Beer and Whisky League  by David Nemec  1994  quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A A  Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing  they made sport of being denounced for being  piratical  by renaming themselves  the Pirates  for the 1891 season  The nickname was first acknowledged on the team s uniforms in 1912  Around the time the team adopted the Pirates nickname  the United States Board on Geographic Names forced the city of Pittsburgh to undergo a controversial name change by having them drop the  h  at the end of the name  making the team s official name the  Pittsburg Pirates  from the adoption of the Pirates nickname until Pittsburgh was able to get the  h  restored to its name in 1911   The Pirates were a strong team in the early 1900s  winning National League pennants from 1901–1903 and taking their first World Series title in 1909  They again won the NL in 1925 and 1927 and the World Series in 1925  After a slow period  they returned to dominance and won the 1960 World Series  1971 World Series and 1979 World Series  They won Eastern Division titles from 1990–1992 but did not return to the post season after that until 2013   2  Rivalries  2 1  Historical  2 1 1  Philadelphia Phillies  The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League  The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered the NL in 1887  four years after the Phillies   The Phillies and the Pirates had remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969  During the period of two division play  1969 to 1993   the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships  reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s  the Pirates nine  the Phillies six  together  the two teams  15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span   After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994  the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished  However  many fans  especially older ones  retain their dislike for the other team and regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fuel the rivalry   2 2  Within the Central Division  The Pirates have had long standing if sometimes dormant rivalries with NL Central Division teams such as the Cincinnati Reds  St  Louis Cardinals  Milwaukee Brewers  with the The Sausage incident and the  You can steal first  game  and the Chicago Cubs  with the Homer in the Gloamin     3  Current roster  4  Players  4 1  Baseball Hall of Fame  4 2  Ford C  Frick Award recipients  4 3  Team captains  Dick Groat   1962

Pirates and the host Philadelphia Phillies aired August 5  1921  on KDKA  AM  Pittsburgh  The Pirates won the game 8–5   In 1925  the Pirates became the first MLB team to recover from a 3 games to 1 deficit in winning a best of seven World Series  they then became the first MLB team to repeat that feat  in 1979   During the 1953 season  the Pirates became the first team to permanently adopt batting helmets on both offense and defense  These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass  miner s cap   This was the mandate of general manager Branch Rickey  who also owned stock in the company producing the helmets  Under Rickey s orders  all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field  The helmets became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters  but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of helmets in the field  partly because of their awkwardly heavy feel  Once the Pirates discarded the helmets on defense  the trend disappeared from the game   First franchise to win a World Series on a home run  1960 World Series  in the decisive 7th game  The only other team to meet this feat is the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993  though they accomplished it in game 6   In the Pirates became the first major league club to create their uniforms using a cotton nylon blend featuring pull over shirts and beltless pants   The first all minority lineup in MLB history took the field on September 1  1971  The lineup was Rennie Stennett  Gene Clines  Roberto Clemente  Willie Stargell  Manny Sanguillén  Dave Cash  Al Oliver  Jackie Hernandez  and Dock Ellis   The first World Series night game was played in Three Rivers Stadium on October 13  1971 — eleven years to the day since Mazeroski s walk off homer brought the Pirates their last World Series title in 1960  In this case  however  it was Game 4 between the Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles  rather than a decisive Game 7  Apparently  good things happen for the Pirates on this date  as they knotted the  71 Series at two games apiece on their way to their fourth title   The first MLB scout to win the  Scout of the Year Award   Howie Haak  in 1984  three additional scouts from the organization have subsequently won the award   The first combined extra inning no hitter in MLB history took place at Three Rivers Stadium on July 12  1997  Francisco Córdova  9 innings  and Ricardo Rincón  1 inning  combined to no hit the Houston Astros  3–0 in 10 innings  Pinch hitter Mark Smith s three run walk off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning sealed the victory and the no hitter for the Pirates  It remains the only such no hitter to date   In November 2008  the Pirates became the first MLB team to sign Indian players when they acquired the non draft free agents of Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel  This was also seen by Pirates General Manager  Neal Huntington  as  not only add ing  two prospects to our system but also hope to open a pathway to an untapped market    The Pirates became the first team in MLB history  as well as all professional sports  to have 20 consecutive losing seasons by posting a 79–83 record in 2012   The Pirates are the first MLB team  as well as only second in major professional sports  to be owned by an openly gay owner  although Kevin McClatchy had already divested his shares in the Pirates when he openly announced his homosexuality in September 2012   7  Minor league affiliations  Former AAA clubs  Hollywood Stars 1945–46 & 1951–57  Salt Lake City Bees 1958–60  Columbus Jets 1957–70  Charleston Charlies 1971–76  Columbus Clippers 1977–78

once planning a tryout for African American players to sign up for the club   The Pirates organization was the first in baseball to have both an African American coach and manager  when Gene Baker broke the color line in 1961 and 1962 respectively  On September 21  1963 the Pirates were the first MLB team to have an African American manager in Gene Baker  as he filled in for Danny Murtaugh   On September 1  1971  manager Murtaugh assembled a starting lineup that was completely composed of minorities for the first time in MLB history   9  Fanbase  Despite having some notable fans including former part owner Bing Crosby  Michael Keaton and Regis Philbin  the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in popularity among Pittsburgh s three major professional sports teams  Many surveys have backed up this finding as well  However  due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season  the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region   While the team s recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh s other two teams can be partly to blame  since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979  the Steelers have won the Super Bowl and the Penguins the Stanley Cup three times each  including both in 2009   distractions off the field have also caused the team s popularity to slip in the city  While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s  the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team s popularity dipped  The team s standing among fans has  however  improved since PNC Park opened in 2001   10  Community activities  Each year  the Pirates recognize six  Community Champions  during a special pregame ceremony   Piratefest is a yearly event that is held by the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball club in January  The event is a baseball carnival for the whole family  It features autograph sessions from current and former Pirates players  live events and games  carnival booths such as dart throwing  baseball clinics   Ask Pirates Management   and much more  Piratefest is held yearly at the David L  Lawrence Convention Center in downtown  It includes bouncy castles for kids and the Pittsburgh Pirate also attends   11  Radio and television  In 2007  the Pirates chose to end the longest relationship between a team and a radio station in American professional sports  KDKA first broadcast the Pirates on August 5  1921  with Westinghouse foreman Harold Arlin behind the mic  Broadcasts ended in 1924  but returned in 1936  Except for a few years on WWSW in the late 1940s and early 1950s  the Pirates were on KDKA for 61 years  KDKA s 50 000 watt clear channel enabled Pirates fans across the eastern half of North America at night to hear the games   That changed for the 2007 season  when the Pirates moved to FM talk radio station WPGB  The Pirates cited the desire to reach more people in the 25–54 age bracket coveted by advertisers  The acquisition of the rights means that Clear Channel Communications holds the rights to every major sports team in Pittsburgh  The Pirates have long had a radio network that has extended across four states  Stations for the 2007 season include Pennsylvania  West Virginia  Ohio  and Maryland radio broadcasters   On October 1  2011  Clear Channel announced that they will not renew their deal with the Pirates  It was speculated that the club s radio broadcasting rights would likely be transferred back to CBS Radio via FM sports radio station KDKA FM  which became official on October 12   Games are televised on Root Sports Pittsburgh  the Pirates  cable television outlet since 1986  when it was known as KBL  There has been no over the air coverage of the Pirates since 2002  when some games were on WCWB  KDKA TV aired Pirates games for 38 years  1957–1994   Games aired on WPXI  1995 1996  and on WPGH TV and WCWB  1997 2002    Announcers Greg Brown  Bob Walk  John Wehner  and Steve Blass shuttle between the radio and TV booths  Also  Tim Neverett began calling Pirates games in 2009 after Lanny Frattare  also known as the voice of the Pirates  retired after the 2008 season  He was the longest working announcer in Pirates history  33 seasons   Neverett  has called NHL  MLB  and Olympic Games  Former Pirates closer Kent Tekulve  a member of the team s 1979 World Series Championship team  serves as a post game analyst for the team on Root Sports Pittsburgh   On October 1  2008  longtime play by play announcer Lanny Frattare retired after 33 seasons  having called Pirates  games since the 1976 season  He is the longest tenured announcer in Pirates  history  surpassing the man he replaced  the late Bob Prince  28 seasons  1948–1975    On December 18  2008  the Pirates hired former Colorado Rockies broadcaster Tim Neverett as the new play by play announcer  Neverett joined Greg Brown in

Image Pittsburgh Pirates Alternate logo png 2010–present  Alternate Logo Image Pirates Logo 2014 Season png 2014–present  The Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years  with the only consistency being the  P  on the team s cap  It was adopted in 1948  Aside from style changes in the cap itself  the  P  logo has remained since   The Pirates have long been innovators in baseball uniforms  In 1948  the team broke away from the patriotic  Red  White  & Blue  color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme  to match that of the colors of the Flag of Pittsburgh and  to a lesser extent at the time  the colors of the then relatively unknown Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL  While they were not the first baseball team to do this  they were one of the first to do this permanently  Along with the San Francisco Giants  the Pirates are one of two pre expansion National League teams that completely changed their colors  although red returned as an  accent color  in 1997 and remained until 2009   In the late 1950s  the team adopted sleeveless jerseys  While not an innovation by the team  that honor goes to the Cincinnati Reds   the Pirates did help to popularize the look  The team brought back the vested jerseys in 2001  a style they retained until 2009  although the away jerseys said  Pittsburgh  in script instead of  Pirates   In 2009  they introduced a new home  away and alternate black jersey all with sleeves  However  they kept the pinstriped sleeveless vest for Sunday home games   To coincide with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970  the team introduced pullover spandex uniforms  the first such team in baseball  and a look that would quickly be adopted by most other teams by the end of the decade  The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button down style in 1991  one of the last teams to switch   The Pirates were also innovators in third jerseys  Even though it would be the Oakland A s that would beat them to having such jerseys  the Pirates  by 1977 had different uniform styles that included two different caps  two different undershirts  three different jerseys and three different pairs of trousers  They would actually rotate  and sometimes mix  with painful results  these styles daily until returning to the basic white and gray uniform ensemble in 1985   In 1976  the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary  To coincide with it  certain NL teams wore old style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes  After the season  the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently   alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons until keeping the black hat in 1985  and kept the hat through the 1986 season  which would be Barry Bonds rookie season with the team  The hats  which recall the team s last World Series championship season  1979   remain popular items in the throwback market   The 2013 season will mark the last of the team s current logo  introduced in 1997 just after former owner Kevin McClatchy took over the team  The Pirates chose to use the  P  on their caps as the primary logo  however  the former logo will continue to be used as a secondary logo   13  See also  Green Weenie  14  References   General  Markusen  Bruce  The Team That Changed Baseball  Roberto Clemente and the 1971
