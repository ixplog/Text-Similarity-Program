Robert Fulton  November 14  1765 – February 24  1815  was a colonial American engineer and inventor who is widely credited with developing the first commercially successful steamboat  In 1800  he was commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte to design the  Nautilus   which was the first practical submarine in history  He is also credited with inventing some of the world s earliest naval torpedoes for use by the British Royal Navy   Fulton became interested in steam engines and using them on steamboats in 1777 when he was around age 12 and visited state delegate William Henry of Lancaster  Pennsylvania  who himself had earlier learned about inventor James Watt   1736 1819   and his Watt steam engine on a visit to England   1  Early life  Robert Fulton was born on a farm in Little Britain  Pennsylvania  on November 14  1765  He had at least three sisters – Isabella  Elizabeth  and Mary  and a younger brother  Abraham  His father  Robert  had been a close friend to the father of painter Benjamin West   1738 1820   Fulton later met West in England and they became friends   Fulton stayed in Philadelphia for six years  where he painted portraits and landscapes  drew houses and machinery  and was able to send money home to help support his mother  In 1785 he bought a farm at Hopewell Township in Washington County for £80 Sterling and moved his mother and family into it  While in Philadelphia  he met Benjamin Franklin   1705 1706 1790   then known not only for his political and writing abilities but his scientific and inventing knowledge  and other prominent figures  At age 23 he decided to visit Europe   2  Education and work  Fulton took several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from the individuals he had met in Philadelphia  He had already corresponded with Benjamin West  and West took Fulton into his home  where Fulton lived for several years  Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes  which allowed him to support himself  but he continually experimented with mechanical inventions   He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a dredging machine and several other inventions  In 1797 he went to Paris where his fame as an inventor was well known  In Paris  then along with London  the scientific centers of the 18th Century world  Fulton studied languages French  and German  along with mathematics and chemistry  He began to design torpedoes and submarines  In Paris  Fulton met James Rumsey   1743 1792   who sat for a portrait in West s studio  where Fulton was an apprentice  Rumsey was an inventor from Virginia who ran his own first steamboat up the Potomac River near Shepherdstown  then in Virginia in 1786  As early as 1793  Fulton proposed plans for steam powered vessels to both the United States and British governments  and in England he met the Duke of Bridgewater  Francis Egerton    1736 1803   whose canal  the first to be constructed in Britain  was being used for trials of a steam tug  Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals and in 1796 wrote a treatise on canal construction  suggesting improvements to locks and other features  Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799  he had a boat constructed in the Duke s timber yard  under the supervision of Benjamin Powell  After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford  the boat was duly christened  Bonaparte  in honour of Fulton having served under Napoleon  After expensive trials  because of the configuration of the design it was feared the paddles may damage the clay lining of the canal and the experiment was eventually abandoned  In 1801 the Duke  impressed by the  Charlotte Dundas  constructed by William Symington   1764 1831   decided to order eight of such vessels for his canal  but when he died in 1803  the order was cancelled  Symington had successfully tried steamboats in 1788  and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments   The first successful trial run of a steamboat had been made several years earlier by inventor John Fitch   1743 1798   on the Delaware River on August 22  1787  in the presence of delegates from the Constitutional Convention  then observing and taking a break from its summer long sessions at Independence Hall  It was propelled by a bank of oars on either side of the boat  The following year Fitch launched a boat powered by a steam engine driving several stern mounted oars  These oars paddled in a manner similar to the motion of a swimming duck s feet  With this boat he carried up to thirty passengers on numerous round trip voyages on the upper Delaware River between Philadelphia and Burlington  New Jersey   Fitch was granted a patent on August 26  1791  after a battle with Rumsey  who had created a similar invention  Unfortunately the newly created Patent Commission did not award the broad monopoly patent that Fitch had asked for  but a patent of the modern kind  for the new design of Fitch s steamboat  It also awarded patents to Rumsey and John Stevens   1749 1838   for their steamboat designs  and the loss of a monopoly caused many of Fitch s investors to leave his company  While his boats were mechanically successful  Fitch failed to pay sufficient attention to construction and operating costs and was unable to justify the economic benefits of steam navigation  It was Fulton who would turn Fitch s idea into a more profitable proposition decades later   In 1797  Fulton went to France  where Claude de Jouffroy  1751 1832   had made a working paddle steamer in 1783  and commenced experimenting with submarine torpedoes and torpedo boats  Fulton is the exhibitor of the first panorama painting to be shown in Paris  which was complete by 1800  Vue de Paris depuis les Tuilerie  painted by Pierre Prévost   1764 1823   Jean Mouchet and Denis Fontaine  The street where his panorama was shown is still called   Rue des Panoramas    Panorama Street  today   Fulton designed the first working submarine  the  Nautilus  between 1793 and 1797  while living in France  When tested his submarine went underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water  He asked the government to subsidize its construction but he was turned down twice  Eventually he approached the Minister of Marine himself and in 1800 was granted permission to build  The shipyard Perrier in Rouen built it and it sailed first in July 1800 on the Seine River in the same city   In France  Fulton also met Robert R  Livingston   1746 1813   who was appointed U S  Ambassador to France in 1801  who was also of a scientifically curious mind  and they decided to build a steamboat together and try running it on the Seine  Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes  made drawings and models  and had a steamboat constructed  At the first trial the boat ran perfectly  but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened  and on August 9  1803  this boat steamed up the River Seine  but sank  The boat was long  beam  and made between against the current   In 1804  Fulton switched allegiance and moved to England  where he was commissioned by the Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger   1759 1806   to build a range of weapons for use by the Royal Navy during Napoleon s invasion scares  Among his inventions were the world s first modern naval  torpedoes   modern  mines    which were tested  along with several other of his inventions  during the 1804 Raid on Boulogne  but met with limited success  Although he continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806  the decisive naval victory by Admiral Horatio Nelson at the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar greatly reduced the risk of French invasion  and Fulton found himself being increasingly ignored   In 1806  Fulton returned to America and married Harriet Livingston  the niece of Robert Livingston and daughter of Walter Livingston  They had four children  Robert  Julia  Mary and Cornelia  In 1807  Fulton and Livingston together built the first commercial steamboat  the  North River Steamboat   later known as the  Clermont    which carried passengers between New York City and upstream to the state capital Albany  New York  The Clermont was able to make the 150 mile trip in 32 hours  From 1811 until his death  Fulton was appointed by the Governor of New York  a member of the Erie Canal Commission   Fulton s final design was the floating battery  Demologos  the world s first steam driven warship built for the United States Navy for the War of 1812  The heavy vessel was not completed until after his death and was renamed the  Fulton  in his honor   From October 1811 to January 1812  Fulton  along with Livingston and Nicholas Isaac Roosevelt  1787 1854   worked together on a joint project to build and travel from Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania on their specially designed and built a new steamboat  New Orleans  solid enough for a long trip down the mid western Ohio River  with stops at Wheeling  Virginia  Cincinnati  Ohio  past the  Falls of the Ohio  at Louisville  Kentucky  to near Cairo  Illinois and the juncture with the Mississippi River  past St  Louis and follow the  Big Muddy  as it was acquiring the nickname  all the way down past Memphis  Tennessee and Natchez  Mississippi to the city of New Orleans on the Gulf of Mexico coast  this just a decade after the United States had acquired the Louisiana Territory from France and the rivers were not well settled  mapped or protected  By achieving this first breaking voyage and also proving the ability of the boat to reverse and go back upstream  changed the entire transportation outlook for the American heartland   Fulton died in 1815 in New York City from tuberculosis  then known as  consumption    He had been walking home on the frozen Hudson River when one of his friends  Addis Emmet  fell through the ice  In the attempt to rescue his friend  Fulton got soaked with icy water and on the journey home he caught pneumonia  When he got home his sickness worsened  He contracted consumption and died at 49 years old  He is buried in the Trinity Church Cemetery for Trinity Church  Episcopal  at Wall Street in New York City  alongside other famous Americans such as former U S  Secretaries of the Treasury  Alexander Hamilton and Albert Gallatin  His descendants include former Major League Baseball pitcher Cory Lidle  Often credited with inventing the steamboat  Robert Fulton was actually the man who put the design into practice  As a young man  Fulton dreamed of becoming a painter and went to Paris to study art  His commissions were few  and he turned to engineering and inventions  In Paris  Fulton designed an experimental submarine  which caught the eye of Robert Livingston  then the wealthy American ambassador to France  Livingston convinced Fulton to return to the United States and concentrate on industrial and steamboat design   Fulton s first boat  the  Clermont   was tested on the Hudson River  The former painter had shipped a small steam engine from England and constructed a hull similar to that of fast ocean  going ships  In the hull  he placed the engine  and on each side  a primitive paddle wheel  At the test in 1807  the  Clermont  initially failed  however  after a few adjustments to the engine  the boat carried on its way to Albany  arriving thirty two hours later  It had moved against the Hudson current at an average of five miles an hour   3  Posthumous honors  In 1816  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania donated a marble statue of Fulton to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol  Fulton was also honored for his development of steamship technology in New York City s Hudson Fulton Celebration of the Centennial in 1909  A replica of his first steam powered steam vessel  the  Clermont   was built for the occasion   Many places in the U S  are named for Robert Fulton  including   Fulton Township  Lancaster County  Pennsylvania

S S  Fulton  in honor of Robert Fulton   from the United States Treasury  Bronze statues of Fulton and Christopher Columbus represent commerce on the balustrade of the galleries of the Main Reading Room in the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington  D C  They are two of 16 historical figures  each pair representing one of the 8 pillars of civilization   In 2006  he was inducted into the  National Inventors Hall of Fame  in Alexandria  Virginia   3 1  In popular culture  A probably largely fictionalised account of Fulton s role was produced by BBC children s television  In the first season   Triton   1968   two British naval officers  Captain Belwether and Lieutenant Lamb  are involved in spying on Fulton while he is working for the French  In the second season   Pegasus   1969   they are surprised to find themselves working with him after he changed sides   20th Century Fox in 1940 released the film  Little Old New York  a highly fictional telling of Fulton’s life from his arrival in New York to the first sailing of the Clermont  British actor Richard Greene stars as Fulton with Brenda Joyce as Harriet Livingston  Much attention is given to Alice Faye and Fred MacMurray as wharf friends who help Fulton realize his dream amid problem after problem  It was based on a play by Rida Johnson Young  The views of an 1807 New York harbor are particularly elaborate and convincing   In the children s TV series  TUGS  a steam powered ferry is named the Fulton Ferry  named after the Fulton Ferry Company  founded by Fulton in 1814   A Robert Fulton cartoon character appears in the Casper the Friendly Ghost short film titled  Red  White  and Boo    Author James McGee used Fulton s experiments in early submarine warfare  against wooden warships  as a major plot element in his novel  Ratcatcher     Invasion   ISBN 9780340961155  the tenth novel in the  Kydd   early 19th Century  Napoleonic Wars  naval warfare series by Julian Stockwin  also uses Fulton and his submarine as an important plot element   In the George and Ira Gershwin song   They All Laughed   in a listing of concepts the public initially thought of as folly   Fulton and his steamboat  Hershey and his chocolate bar  are cited   Additionally  he is referenced in The Beach Boys rock group song  Steamboat   Dennis Wilson Jack Rieley  from the 1973 record album  Holland    In the  Simpsons  television series episode   The Wettest Stories Ever Told   when Marge  playing a Tahitian ruler  mentions Fulton in the line   Tell me  has Robert Fulton invented the steamboat yet   as they have no communication with the outside world  Jimbo s character replies  Any day now   referring to Fulton s  Clermont   ironically and erroneously suggesting that news of Fulton s invention has actually reached her and others already  despite his steamboat not being invented until 1807   4  Gallery  Image Robert Fulton presents the first steamship to Napoleon Bonaparte
