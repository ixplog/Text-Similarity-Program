A tor  which is also known by geomorphologists as either a castle koppie or kopje  is a large  free standing rock outcrop that rises abruptly from the surrounding smooth and gentle slopes of a rounded hill summit or ridge crest  In the South West of England  the term is commonly also used for the hills themselves – particularly the high points of Dartmoor in Devon and Bodmin Moor in Cornwall   1  Name  The word tor           meaning hill  is notable for being one of the very few Celtic loanwords to be borrowed into vernacular English before the modern era – such borrowings are mainly words of a geographic or topographical nature  Another word is crag  from Welsh craig  rock     2  Formation  Tors are most common and most well known as a landform that was created by the erosion and weathering of granitic rocks  However  tor have also developed by the erosion and weathering of schists  dacites  dolerites  and coarse sandstones among other rock types  Tors are mostly less than high  A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of tors and their origin remains a topic of continuing discussion among geologists and geomorphologists  and physical geographers  It is considered likely that tors were created by geomorphic processes that differed widely in type and duration according to regional and local differences in climate and rock types   For example the Dartmoor granite was emplaced around 280 million years ago  with the cover rocks stripped off soon afterwards  exposing it to chemical and physical weathering processes  Where joints are closely spaced  the large crystals in the granite readily disintegrate to form a sandy regolith known locally as growan  This is readily stripped off by solifluction or surface wash when not protected by vegetation  notably during prolonged cold phases during the Quaternary ice ages   periglaciation  Where joints happen to be unusually widely spaced  core blocks can survive and escape above the weathering surface  developing into tors  These can be monolithic  as at Haytor and Blackingstone Rock  but are more usually subdivided into stacks  often arranged in avenues  Each stack can comprise several tiers or pillows  which may become separated  rocking pillows are called logan stones  These stacks are vulnerable to frost action  often collapsing  with trails of blocks called clitter down the slopes  Weathering has also given rise to circular  rock basins  formed by the accumulation of water and the repeated freezing and thawing – a fine example is to be found at Kes Tor on Dartmoor  Dating of 28 Dartmoor tors shows that most are surprisingly young  less than 100 000 years old  with none over 200 000 years old  They probably emerged at the start of the last big ice age  Devensian   By contrast in the Scottish Cairngorms  the other classic granite tor concentration in Britain  the oldest tors dated are between 200 and 675 000 years old  with even glacially modified ones having dates of 100 150 000 years  This may reflect a dryer  more arctic climate   3  Tors in Great Britain  3 1  Dartmoor  Dartmoor represents one of the largest areas of exposed granite in the United Kingdom  covering an area of 368 square miles  954 square kilometres   It is part of a chain of granite stretching through Cornwall  as far as the Isles of Scilly   Some of the more durable granite survived to form the rocky crowns of Dartmoor tors  One of the best known is at Haytor  on the eastern part of the moor  whose granite is of unusually fine quality and was quarried from the hillside below the tor during the 19th and early 20th centuries  Its stone was used to construct the pillars outside the British Museum in London  and to build London Bridge  The last granite to be quarried there was used to build Exeter War Memorial in 1919   Ten Tors is an annual weekend hike on Dartmoor   3 2  Cornwall  Alex Tor  Bodmin Moor  Hawk s Tor  Bodmin Moor  Helman Tor  mid–Cornwall  Rough
