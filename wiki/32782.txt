Voyager 2 is a space probe launched by NASA on August 20  1977 to study the outer Solar System and eventually interstellar space  It was actually launched before Voyager 1  but Voyager 1 moved faster and eventually passed it  Voyager 2 has been operating for as of   and the Deep Space Network is still receiving its data transmissions   At a distance of from the Sun as of December 11  2014  it is one of the most distant human made objects  along with Voyager 1  Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11   Voyager 2 is part of the Voyager program with its identical sister craft Voyager 1  and is in extended mission  tasked with locating and studying the boundaries of the Solar System  including the Kuiper belt  the heliosphere and interstellar space   The primary mission ended December 31  1989 after encountering the Jovian system in 1979  Saturnian system in 1981  Uranian system in 1986  and the Neptunian system in 1989  It is still the only spacecraft to have visited the two outer giant planets Uranus and Neptune  The probe is now moving at a velocity of 15 428 km s relative to the Sun   1  Mission background  1 1  History  Conceived in the 1960s  a Grand tour proposal to study the outer planets prompted NASA to begin work on a mission in the early 1970s  The development of the interplanetary probes coincided with an alignment of the planets  making possible a mission to the outer Solar System by taking advantage of the then new technique of gravity assist   It was determined that utilizing gravity assists would enable a single probe to visit the four gas giants  Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus  and Neptune  while requiring a minimal amount of propellant and a shorter transit duration between planets  Originally  Voyager 2 was planned as Mariner 12 of the Mariner program  however  due to congressional budget cuts  the mission was scaled back to be a flyby of Jupiter and Saturn  and renamed the Mariner Jupiter Saturn probes  As the program progressed  the name was later changed to Voyager as the probe designs began to differ greatly from previous Mariner missions   Upon a successful flyby of the Saturnian moon Titan by Voyager 1  Voyager 2 would get a mission extension to send the probe on towards Uranus and Neptune  ultimately realizing the vision of the Planetary Grand Tour   1 2  Spacecraft design  Constructed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  JPL   Voyager 2 included 16 hydrazine thrusters  three axis stabilization  gyroscopes and celestial referencing instruments  Sun sensor Canopus Star Tracker  to maintain pointing of the high gain antenna toward Earth  Collectively these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem  AACS  along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters  The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects as it traveled through space   1 2 1  Communications  Built with the intent for eventual interstellar travel  Voyager 2 included a large  parabolic  high gain antenna    to transceive data via the Deep Space Network on the Earth  Communications are conducted over the S band  about 13 cm wavelength  and X band  about 3 6 cm wavelength  providing data rates as high as 115 2 kilobits per second at the distance of Jupiter  and then ever decreasing as the distance increased  because of the inverse square law  When the spacecraft is unable to communicate with Earth  the Digital Tape Recorder  DTR  can record about 64 megabytes of data for transmission at another time   1 2 2  Power  The spacecraft was built with 3 Multihundred Watt radioisotope thermoelectric generators  MHW RTG   Each RTG includes 24 pressed plutonium oxide spheres and provides enough heat to generate approximately 157 watts of power at launch  Collectively  the RTGs supply the spacecraft with 470 watts at launch and will allow operations to continue until at least 2020   File Voyager Program   RTG diagram 1 png RTG diagram 1 File Voyager

Cape Canaveral  Florida  aboard a Titan IIIE Centaur launch vehicle  Two weeks later  the twin Voyager 1 probe would be launched on September 5  1977  However  Voyager 1 would reach both Jupiter and Saturn sooner  as Voyager 2 had been launched into a longer  more circular trajectory   File Titan 3E Centaur launches Voyager 2 jpg   Voyager 2 launch on August 20  1977 with a Titan IIIE Centaur

illustrating the use of gravity assists to accelerate the spacecraft by Jupiter  Saturn and Uranus  To observe Triton  Voyager 2 passed over Neptune s north pole  resulting in an acceleration out of the plane of the ecliptic  and  as a result  a reduced velocity relative to the Sun   3 1  Encounter with Jupiter  The closest approach to Jupiter occurred on July 9  1979  It came within of the planet s cloud tops  It discovered a few rings around Jupiter  as well as volcanic activity on the moon Io   The Great Red Spot was revealed as a complex storm moving in a counterclockwise direction  An array of other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds   Discovery of active volcanism on Io was easily the greatest unexpected discovery at Jupiter  It was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System  Together  the Voyagers observed the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io  and there is evidence that other eruptions occurred between the two Voyager fly bys   The moon Europa displayed a large number of intersecting linear features in the low resolution photos from Voyager 1  At first  scientists believed the features might be deep cracks  caused by crustal rifting or tectonic processes  The closer high resolution photos from Voyager 2  however  left scientists puzzled  The features were so lacking in topographic relief that as one scientist described them  they  might have been painted on with a felt marker   Europa is internally active due to tidal heating at a level about one tenth that of Io  Europa is thought to have a thin crust  less than thick  of water ice  possibly floating on a 50 kilometer deep  30 mile  ocean   Two new  small satellites  Adrastea and Metis  were found orbiting just outside the ring  A third new satellite  Thebe  was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea and Io   3 2  Encounter with Saturn  The closest approach to Saturn occurred on August 26  1981   While passing behind Saturn  as viewed from Earth   Voyager 2 probed Saturn s upper atmosphere with its radio link to gather information on atmospheric temperature and density profiles  Voyager 2 found that at the uppermost pressure levels  seven kilopascals of pressure   Saturn s temperature was 70 kelvins  −203 °C   while at the deepest levels measured  120 kilopascals  the temperature increased to 143 K  −130 °C   The north pole was found to be 10 kelvins cooler  although this may be seasonal  see also Saturn Oppositions    After the fly by of Saturn  the camera platform of Voyager 2 locked up briefly  putting plans to officially extend the mission to Uranus and Neptune in jeopardy  Fortunately  the mission s engineers were able to fix the problem  caused by an overuse that temporarily depleted its lubricant   and the Voyager 2 probe was given the go ahead to explore the Uranian system   3 3  Encounter with Uranus  The closest approach to Uranus occurred on January 24  1986  when Voyager 2 came within of the planet s cloud tops  Voyager 2 also discovered the moons Cordelia  Ophelia  Bianca  Cressida  Desdemona  Juliet  Portia  Rosalind  Belinda  Perdita and Puck  studied the planet s unique atmosphere  caused by its axial tilt of 97 8°  and examined the Uranian ring system   Uranus is the third largest  Neptune has a larger mass  but a smaller volume  planet in the Solar System  It orbits the Sun at a distance of about 2 8 billion kilometers  1 7 billion miles   and it completes one orbit every 84 Earth years  The length of a day on Uranus as measured by Voyager 2 is 17 hours  14 minutes  Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axial tilt is about 90°  meaning that its axis is roughly parallel with  not perpendicular to  the plane of the ecliptic  This extremely large tilt of its axis is thought to be the result of a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet sized body early in the history of the Solar System  Given the unusual orientation of its axis  with the polar regions of Uranus exposed for periods of many years to either continuous sunlight or darkness  planetary scientists were not at all sure what to expect when observing Uranus   Voyager 2 found that one of the most striking effects of the sideways orientation of Uranus is the effect on the tail of the planetary magnetic field  This is itself tilted about 60° from the Uranian axis of rotation  The planet s magneto tail was shown to be twisted by the rotation of Uranus into a long corkscrew shape following the planet  The presence of a significant magnetic field for Uranus was not at all known until Voyager s 2 arrival   The radiation belts of Uranus were found to be of an intensity similar to those of Saturn  The intensity of radiation within the Uranian belts is such that irradiation would  quickly  darken — within 100 000 years — any methane that is trapped in the icy surfaces of the inner moons and ring particles  This kind of darkening might have contributed to the darkened surfaces of the moons and the ring particles  which are almost uniformly dark gray in color   A high layer of haze was detected around the sunlit pole of Uranus  This area was also found to radiate large amounts of ultraviolet light  a phenomenon that is called  dayglow   The average atmospheric temperature is about 60 K  −350°F −213°C   Surprisingly  the illuminated and dark poles  and most of the planet  exhibit nearly the same temperatures at the cloud tops   The Uranian moon Miranda  the innermost of the five large moons  was discovered to be one of the strangest bodies yet seen in the Solar System  Detailed images from Voyager 2 s flyby of Miranda showed huge canyons made from geological faults as deep as   terraced layers  and a mixture of old and young surfaces  One hypothesis suggests that Miranda might consist of a reaggregation of material following an earlier event when Miranda was shattered into pieces by a violent impact   All nine of the previously known Uranian rings were studied by the instruments of Voyager 2  These measurements showed that the Uranian rings are distinctly different from those at Jupiter and Saturn  The Uranian ring system might be relatively young  and it did not form at the same time that Uranus did  The particles that make up the rings might be the remnants of a moon that was broken up by either a high velocity impact or torn up by tidal effects   3 4  Encounter with Neptune  Voyager 2 s closest approach to Neptune occurred on August 25  1989  Since this was the last planet of our Solar System that Voyager 2 could visit  the Chief Project Scientist  his staff members  and the flight controllers decided to also perform a close fly by of Triton  the larger of Neptune s two originally known moons  so as to gather as much information on Neptune and Triton as possible  regardless of Voyager 2 s departure angle from the planet  This was just like the case of Voyager 1 s encounters with Saturn and its massive moon Titan   Through repeated computerized test simulations of trajectories through the Neptunian system conducted in advance  flight controllers determined the best way to route Voyager 2 through the Neptune Triton system  Since the plane of the orbit of Triton is tilted significantly with respect to the plane of the ecliptic  through mid course corrections  Voyager 2 was directed into a path several thousand miles over the north pole of Neptune  At that time  Triton was behind and below  south of  Neptune  at an angle of about 25 degrees below the ecliptic   close to the apoapsis of its elliptical orbit  The gravitational pull of Neptune bent the trajectory of Voyager 2 down in the direction of Triton  In less than 24 hours  Voyager 2 traversed the distance between Neptune and Triton  and then observed Triton s northern hemisphere as it passed over its north pole   The net and final effect on the trajectory of Voyager 2 was to bend its trajectory south below the plane of the ecliptic by about 30 degrees  Voyager 2 is on this path permanently  and hence  it is exploring space south of the plane of the ecliptic  measuring magnetic fields  charged particles  etc   there  and sending the measurements back to the Earth via telemetry   While in the neighborhood of Neptune  Voyager 2 discovered the  Great Dark Spot   which has since disappeared  according to observations by the Hubble Space Telescope  Originally thought to be a large cloud itself  the  Great Dark Spot  was later hypothesized to be a hole in the visible cloud deck of Neptune   Neptune s atmosphere consists of hydrogen  helium  and methane  The methane in Neptune s upper atmosphere absorbs the red light from the Sun  but it reflects the blue light from the Sun back into space  This is why Neptune looks blue   With the decision of the International Astronomical Union to reclassify Pluto as a  plutoid  in 2008  the flyby of Neptune by Voyager 2 in 1989 became the point when every known planet in the Solar System had been visited at least once by a space probe   4  Interstellar mission  Once its planetary mission was over  Voyager 2 was described as working on an interstellar mission  which NASA is using to find out what the Solar System is like beyond the heliosphere  Voyager 2 is currently transmitting scientific data at about 160 bits per second  Information about continuing telemetry exchanges with Voyager 2 is available from Voyager Weekly Reports   On November 30  2006  a telemetered command to Voyager 2 was incorrectly decoded by its on board computer—in a random error—as a command to turn on the electrical heaters of the spacecraft s magnetometer  These heaters remained turned on until December 4  2006  and during that time  there was a resulting high temperature above   significantly higher than the magnetometers were designed to endure  and a sensor rotated away from the correct orientation  It has not been possible to fully diagnose and correct for the damage caused to Voyager 2 s magnetometer  although efforts to do so are proceeding   On August 30  2007  Voyager 2 passed the termination shock and then entered into the heliosheath  approximately 1 billion miles  1 6 billion km  closer to the Sun than Voyager 1 did  This is due to the interstellar magnetic field of deep space  The southern hemisphere of the Solar System s heliosphere is being pushed in   On April 22  2010  Voyager 2 encountered scientific data format problems  On May 17  2010  JPL engineers revealed that a flipped bit in an on board computer had caused the issue  and scheduled a bit reset for May 19   On May 23  2010  Voyager 2 resumed sending science data from deep space after engineers fixed the flipped bit  Currently research is being made into marking the area of memory with the flipped bit off limits or disallowing its use  The Low Energy Charged Particle Instrument is currently operational  and data from this instrument concerning charged particles is being transmitted to Earth  This data permits measurements of the heliosheath and termination shock  There has also been a modification to the on board flight software to delay turning off the AP Branch 2 backup heater for 1 year  It was scheduled to go off February 2  2011  DOY 033  2011–033    On July 25  2012  Voyager 2 was traveling at 15 447 km s relative to the Sun at about from the Sun  at −55 29° declination and 19 888 h right ascension  and also at an ecliptic latitude of −34 0 degrees  placing it in the constellation Telescopium as observed from Earth  This location places it deep in the scattered disc  and traveling outward at roughly 3 264 AU per year  It is more than twice as far from the Sun as Pluto  and far beyond the perihelion of 90377 Sedna  but not yet beyond the outer limits of the orbit of the dwarf planet Eris   On September 9  2012  Voyager 2 was from the Earth and from the Sun  and traveling at  relative to the Sun  and traveling outward at about 3 256 AU per year  Sunlight takes 13 73 hours to get to Voyager 2  The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft is magnitude  16 7  Voyager 2 is heading in the direction of the constellation Telescopium   To compare  Proxima Centauri  the closest star to our Sun  is about 4 2 light years  or   distant  Voyager 2 s current relative velocity to the Sun is   This calculates as 3 254 AU per year  about 10% slower than Voyager 1  At this velocity  81 438 years would pass before reaching the nearest star  Proxima Centauri  were the spacecraft traveling in the direction of that star  Voyager 2 will need about 19 390 years at its current velocity to travel a complete light year    On November 7  2012  Voyager 2 reached 100 AU from the sun  making it the third human made object to reach 100 AU  Voyager 1 was 122 AU from the Sun  and Pioneer 10 is presumed to be at 107 AU  While Pioneer has ceased communications  both of the Voyager spacecraft are performing well and are still communicating   5  Future of the probe  Voyager 2 is expected to enter interstellar space within a few years of 2016  and its plasma spectrometer should provide the first direct measurements of the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma   Voyager 2 is not headed toward any particular star  although in roughly 40 000 years it should pass 1 7 light years from the star Ross 248  And if undisturbed for 296 000 years  Voyager 2 should pass by the star Sirius at a distance of 4 3 light years  Voyager 2 is expected to keep transmitting weak radio messages until at least 2025  over 48 years after it was launched   5 1  Golden record  Each Voyager space probe carries a gold plated audio visual disc in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by intelligent life forms from
