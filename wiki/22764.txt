The Orthodox Bahá í Faith is a small Bahá í sect that formed in 1960 by Mason Remey  and subsequently was the name used by Joel Marangella after he claimed to be Remey s successor  The basis of the dispute is over the identity of the Bahá í Guardian  a term referring to the appointed head of the religion  an executive hereditary office held by Shoghi Effendi from 1921 to 1957   Other than on the matter of leadership and organization  there are few differences between the orthodox and mainstream Bahá ís in matters of doctrine  As a group who believe that Mason Remey was the second Guardian of the Bahá í Faith  they are considered heretical Covenant breakers by the majority of Bahá ís who follow the leadership of the Universal House of Justice   Membership data of the Orthodox Bahá ís is scarce  One source estimated them at no more than 100 members as of 1988  Memorandums from an Illinois court case in 2007 state their membership in the United States at 40  Websites claiming to represent the Orthodox community indicate followers in the United States and India  Joel Marangella died in San Diego  California on Sept 1  2013   1  Background  Following the unexpected death of the Bahá í Faith s first Guardian Shoghi Effendi in 1957  the 27 living Hands of the Cause  having the responsibility to acknowledge any appointment of a successor  gathered and decided that he had died  without having appointed his successor   and that the Universal House of Justice would decide on the situation after its first election  Charles Mason Remey  one of the Hands  declared himself the successor to Shoghi Effendi in 1960  His claim was rejected by the 26 remaining Hands  on the basis that he was not a descendant of Bahá u lláh  nor was he appointed to the position by Shoghi Effendi  Remey based his claim on his being the president of the International Bahá í Council appointed by Shoghi Effendi in 1951  The result was that Remey was unanimously expelled from the Bahá í community by the Hands of the Cause   In 1962 Remey asked his supporters in the United States to organize themselves and elect a  National Spiritual Assembly Under the Hereditary Guardianship   NSAUHG   first elected in 1963  The Assembly of 9 members was incorporated in New Mexico in 1964   In 1964 the NSAUHG filed a lawsuit against the National Spiritual Assembly  NSA  of the Bahá ís of the United States to receive the legal title to the Bahá í House of Worship in Illinois  and all other property owned by the NSA  The NSA counter sued  and in August 1966 Remey instructed the NSAUHG to withdraw from any action in the matter  regardless of the consequences   Later that year  Remey asked the NSAUHG to dissolve  as well as the International Bahá í Council that he had appointed with Joel Marangella as president  residing in France  Marangella previously served on the National Spiritual Assembly of France in 1961  and was declared a Covenant breaker when he accepted Mason Remey as the next Guardian   Over the years following 1966 the followers of Mason Remey were not organized  with some of his followers concluding that Remey was suffering from dementia  until several of the individuals involved began forming their own groups based on different understandings of succession   In 1962 Remey gave Marangella a sealed envelope  with instructions to open it when the time was right  In 1965 Mason Remey called for the International Bahá í Council  of which Marangella was president  to become active  Marangella then opened the sealed letter  which was a hand written note by Remey appointing Marangella as his successor  Marangella looks upon that time as the time of his official appointment  Remey then changed his mind  deactivated the International Bahá í Council in 1966  and in 1969 Marangella announced that he was the third Guardian  All of the members of the 1966 NSAUHG accepted Marangella s claim   In 1970 Marangella appointed members to a  National Bureau of the Orthodox Bahá ís in New York   which two years later was moved to New Mexico  and subsequently changed its name to  Mother Bahá í Council of the United States   1978  and  Provisional National Bahá í Council   2000   with all members appointed by Joel Marangella   Marangella died in San Diego  CA on Sept 1  2013   2  Notes  3  External links  website maintained on behalf of Joel Marangella   National Bahá í Council of the United States
