The Warsaw Pact  formally  the Treaty of Friendship  Co operation  and Mutual Assistance  sometimes  informally WarPac  akin in format to NATO  was a collective defense treaty among eight communist states of Central and Eastern Europe in existence during the Cold War  The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  CoMEcon   the regional economic organization for the communist States of Central and Eastern Europe  The Warsaw Pact was in part a Soviet military reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955 per the Paris Pacts of 1954  but was primarily motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe  in turn  according to The Warsaw Pact s preamble  meant to maintain peace in Europe  guided by the objective points and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  1945   After the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War  the alliance was transformed into the subsequent Collective Security Treaty Organization  or CSTO   1  Nomenclature  In the Western Bloc  the Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship  Cooperation  and Mutual Assistance is often called the Warsaw Pact military alliance—abbreviated WAPA  Warpac  and WP  Elsewhere  in the former member states  the Warsaw Treaty is known as   Romanized Bulgarian  Dogovor za druzhba  satrudnichestvo i vzaimopomosht  Romanized Russian  Dogovor o druzhbe  sotrudnichestve i vzaimnoy pomoshchi  2  Structure  The Warsaw Treaty s organization was two fold  the Political Consultative Committee handled political matters  and the Combined Command of Pact Armed Forces controlled the assigned multi national forces  with headquarters in Warsaw  Poland  Furthermore  the Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization which commands and controls all the military forces of the member countries was also a First Deputy Minister of Defense of the USSR  and the Chief of Combined Staff of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization was also a First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR  Therefore  although ostensibly an international collective security alliance  the USSR dominated the Warsaw Treaty armed forces   3  Strategy  The strategy behind the formation of the Warsaw Pact was driven by the desire of the Soviet Union to dominate Central and Eastern Europe  This policy was driven by ideological and geostrategic reasons  Ideologically  the Soviet Union arrogated the right to define socialism and communism and act as the leader of the global socialist movement  A corollary to this idea was the necessity of intervention if a country appeared to be violating core socialist ideas and Communist Party functions  which was explicitly stated in the Brezhnev Doctrine  Geostrategic principles also drove the Soviet Union to prevent invasion of its territory by Western European powers  which had occurred most recently by Nazi Germany in 1941  The invasion launched by Hitler had been exceptionally brutal and the USSR emerged from the Second World War in 1945 with the greatest total casualties of any participant in the war  suffering an estimated 27 million killed along with the destruction of much of the nation s industrial capacity   4  History  4 1  Beginnings  In March 1954  the USSR  fearing  the restoration of German Militarism  in West Germany  requested admission to NATO  By then  laws had already been passed in West Germany ending denazification and the Gehlen Organization  predecessor of the West German Federal Intelligence Service  was fully operative and employing hundreds of ex Nazis   The Soviet request to join NATO arose in the aftermath of the Berlin Conference of January–February 1954  Soviet foreign minister Molotov made different proposals to have Germany reunified and elections for a pan German government  under conditions of withdrawal of the four powers armies and German neutrality  but all were refused by the other foreign ministers  Dulles  USA   Eden  UK  and Bidault  France   Proposals for the reunification of Germany were nothing new  earlier in 1952  talks about a German reunification ended after the United Kingdom  France  and the United States insisted that a unified Germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the European Defence Community and rearm   Consequently Molotov  fearing that EDC would be directed in the future against the USSR therefore  seeking to prevent the formation of groups of European States directed against other European States   made a proposal for a General European Treaty on Collective Security in Europe  open to all European States without regard as to their social systems  which would have included the unified Germany  thus making the EDC – perceived by the USSR as a threat – unusable   But again  Eden  Dulles and Bidault opposed the proposal   One month later  the proposed European Treaty was rejected not only by supporters of the EDC but also by western opponents of the European Defense Community  like French Gaullist leader Palewski  who perceived it as  unacceptable in its present form because it excludes the USA from participation in the collective security system in Europe   The Soviets then decided to make a new proposal to the governments of the USA  UK and France stating to accept the participation of the USA in the proposed General European Agreement  And considering that another argument deployed against the Soviet proposal was that it was perceived by western powers as  directed against the North Atlantic Pact and its liquidation   the Soviets decided to declare their  readiness to examine jointly with other interested parties the question of the participation of the USSR in the North Atlantic bloc   specifying that  the admittance of the USA into the General European Agreement should not be conditional on the three western powers agreeing to the USSR joining the North Atlantic Pact    Again all proposals  including the request to join NATO  were rejected by UK  US  and French governments shortly after  Emblematic was the position of British General Hastings Ismay  supporter of NATO expansion  who said that NATO  must grow until the whole free world gets under one umbrella   He opposed the request to join NATO made by the USSR in 1954 saying that  the Soviet request to join NATO is like an unrepentant burglar requesting to join the police force    In April 1954 Adenauer made his first visit to the USA meeting Nixon  Eisenhower and Dulles  Ratification of EDC was delaying but the US representatives made it clear to Adenauer that EDC would have to become a part of NATO   Memories of the Nazi occupation were still strong  and the rearmament of Germany was feared by France too  On 30 August 1954 French Parliament rejected the EDC  thus ensuring its failure and blocking a major objective of US policy towards Europe  to associate Germany s militarily with the West  The US Department of State started to elaborate alternatives  Germany would be invited to join NATO or  in the case of French obstructionism  strategies to circumvent a French veto would be implemented in order to obtain a German rearmament outside NATO   On 23 October 1954 – only nine years after Allies  UK  USA and USSR  defeated Nazi Germany ending World War II in Europe – the Federal Republic of Germany was finally admitted to the North Atlantic Pact  The incorporation of West Germany into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as  a decisive turning point in the history of our continent  by Halvard Lange  Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway at the time  On 14 May 1955  the USSR and other seven European countries  reaffirming their desire for the establishment of a system of European collective security based on the participation of all European states irrespective of their social and political systems  established the Warsaw Pact in response to the integration of the Federal Republic of Germany into NATO  declaring that   a remilitarized Western Germany and the integration of the latter in the North Atlantic bloc       increase the danger of another war and constitutes a threat to the national security of the peaceable states        in these circumstances the peaceable European states must take the necessary measures to safeguard their security    One of the founding members  East Germany was allowed to re arm by the Soviet Union and the National People s Army was established as the armed forces of the country to counter the rearmament of West Germany   4 2  Members  The eight member countries of the Warsaw Pact pledged the mutual defense of any member who would be attacked  Relations among the treaty signatories were based upon mutual non intervention in the internal affairs of the member countries  respect for national sovereignty  and political independence  However  almost all governments of those members states were indirectly controlled by the Soviet Union   The founding signatories to the Treaty of Friendship  Cooperation and Mutual Assistance consisted of the following communist governments   People s Republic of Albania  withheld support in 1961 because of the Sino–Soviet split  formally withdrew in 1968   People s Republic of Bulgaria  Czechoslovak Republic  Czechoslovak Socialist Republic since 1960   German Democratic Republic  withdrew in September 1990  before German reunification   People s Republic of Hungary  People s Republic of Poland  withdrew on January 1  1990   People s Republic of Romania  after 1965 the Socialist Republic of Romania   Union of Soviet Socialist Republics In July 1963 the Mongolian People s Republic asked to join the Warsaw Pact under Article 9 of the treaty  For this purpose a special protocol should have been taken since the text of the treaty applied only to Europe  Due to the emerging Sino Soviet split  Mongolia remained on observer status  Soviet stationing troops were agreed to stay in Mongolia from 1966   4 3  During Cold War  For 36 years  NATO and the Warsaw Pact never directly waged war against each other in Europe  the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies implemented strategic policies aimed at the containment of each other in Europe  while working and fighting for influence within the wider Cold War on the international stage   In 1956  following the declaration of the Imre Nagy government of withdrawal of Hungary from the Warsaw Pact  Soviet troops entered the country and removed the government  Soviet forces crushed the nation wide revolt  leading to the death of an estimated 2 500 Hungarian citizens   The multi national Communist armed forces  sole joint action was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968  All member countries  with the exception of the Socialist Republic of Romania and the People s Republic of Albania participated in the invasion   4 4  End of the Cold War  Beginning at the Cold War s conclusion  in late 1989  popular civil and political public discontent forced the Communist governments of the Warsaw Treaty countries from power – independent national politics made feasible with the perestroika  and glasnost induced institutional collapse of Communist government in the USSR  Eventually  the populaces of Hungary  Czechoslovakia  Albania  East Germany  Poland  Romania  and Bulgaria deposed their Communist governments in the period from 1989–91   On 25 February 1991  the Warsaw Pact was declared disbanded at a meeting of defense and foreign ministers from Pact countries meeting in Hungary  On 1 July 1991  in Prague  the Czechoslovak President Václav Havel formally ended the 1955 Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship  Cooperation  and Mutual Assistance and so disestablished the Warsaw Treaty after 36 years of military alliance with the USSR  The treaty was de facto disbanded in December 1989 during the violent revolution in Romania that toppled the communist government there  The USSR disestablished itself in December 1991   5  Central and Eastern Europe after the Warsaw Treaty  On 12 March 1999  the Czech Republic  Hungary  and Poland joined NATO  Bulgaria  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Romania  and Slovakia joined in March 2004  Albania joined on 1 April 2009   Russia and some other post USSR states joined in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation  CSTO    In November 2005  the Polish government opened its Warsaw Treaty archives to the Institute of National Remembrance  who published some 1 300 declassified documents in January 2006  Yet the Polish government reserved publication of 100 documents  pending their military declassification  Eventually  30 of the reserved 100 documents were published  70 remained secret  and unpublished  Among the documents published is the Warsaw Treaty s nuclear war plan  Seven Days to the River Rhine – a short  swift attack capturing Austria  Denmark  Germany and Netherlands east of River Rhine  using nuclear weapons  in self defense  after a NATO first strike  The plan originated as a 1979 field training exercise war game  and metamorphosed into official Warsaw Treaty battle doctrine  until the late 1980s – which is why the People’s Republic of Poland was a nuclear weapons base  first  to 178  then  to 250 tactical range rockets  Doctrinally  as a Soviet style  offensive  battle plan  Seven Days to the River Rhine gave commanders few defensive war strategies for fighting NATO in Warsaw Treaty territory
