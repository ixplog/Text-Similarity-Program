Paranasal sinuses are a group of four paired air filled spaces that surround the nasal cavity  maxillary sinuses   above the eyes  frontal sinuses   between the eyes  ethmoidal sinuses   and behind the ethmoids  sphenoidal sinuses   The sinuses are named for the facial bones in which they are located   1  Structure  Humans possess four paired paranasal sinuses  divided into subgroups that are named according to the bones within which the sinuses lie   the maxillary sinuses  also called the maxillary antrechea and the largest of the paranasal sinuses  are under the eyes  in the maxillary bones   the frontal sinuses  superior to the eyes  in the frontal bone  which forms the hard part of the forehead   the ethmoidal sinuses  which are formed from several discrete air cells within the ethmoid bone between the nose and the eyes   the sphenoidal sinuses  in the sphenoid bone  The paranasal air sinuses are lined with respiratory epithelium  ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium    1 1  Development  Paranasal sinuses form developmentally through excavation of bone by air filled sacs  pneumatic diverticula  from the nasal cavity  This process begins prenatally  and it continues through the course of an organism s lifetime   The results of experimental studies suggest that the natural ventilation rate of a sinus with a single ostium is extremely slow  Indeed  such limited ventilation may be protective for the sinus  as it would help prevent drying of its mucosal surface and maintain a near sterile environment with high NO concentrations and minimal pathogen access  Thus composition of gas content in the maxillary sinus is similar to venous blood  with high CO2 and lower O2 level compared to breathing air   2  Function  The biological role of the sinuses is debated  but a number of possible functions have been proposed   Decreasing the relative weight of the front of the skull  and especially the bones of the face   Increasing resonance of the voice   Providing a buffer against blows to the face   Insulating sensitive structures like dental roots and eyes from rapid temperature fluctuations in the nasal cavity   Humidifying and heating of inhaled air because of slow air turnover in this region   Regulation of intranasal and serum gas pressures  Immunological defense Despite these various proposals  the paranasal sinuses may not serve any biological function at all  instead developing as spandrels during ontogeny   3  Clinical relevance  3 1  Inflammation  The paranasal sinuses are joined to the nasal cavity via small orifices called ostia  These become blocked easily by allergic inflammation  or by swelling in the nasal lining that occurs with a cold  If this happens  normal drainage of mucus within the sinuses is disrupted  and sinusitis may occur  Because the maxillary posterior teeth are close to the maxillary sinus  this can also cause clinical problems if any disease processes are present  such as an infection in any of these teeth  These clinical problems can include secondary sinusitis  the inflammation of the sinuses from another source such as an infection of the adjacent teeth   These conditions may be treated with drugs such as decongestants  which cause vasoconstriction in the sinuses  reducing inflammation  by traditional techniques of nasal irrigation  or by corticosteroid   3 2  Cancer  Malignancies of the paranasal sinuses comprise approximately 0 2% of all malignancies  About 80% of these malignancies arise in the maxillary sinus  Men are much more often affected than women  They most often occur in the age group between 40 and 70 years  Carcinomas are more frequent than sarcomas  Metastases are rare  Tumours of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are extremely rare   4  History  4 1  Etymology  Sinus is a latin word meaning a fold or pocket  in particular the front pocket in a toga   5  Other animals  Paranasal sinuses occur in many other animals  including most mammals  birds  non avian dinosaurs  and crocodilians  The bones occupied by sinuses are quite variable in these other species   6  Additional images  7  See also  8  References  9  External links     Inactive link  November 2014
