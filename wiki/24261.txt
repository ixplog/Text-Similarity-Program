years ago  Archeological traces have been found of various cultures during the Stone and Bronze Age  Baltic peoples  Germanic peoples and Veneti during the Iron Age and  in the Middle Ages  Slavic tribes and Vikings  Starting in the 10th century  early Polish dukes on several occasions subdued parts of the region from the southeast  while the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark augmented their territory from the west and north   3 2  High Middle Ages to Early Modern Age  In the 12th century  narrow Pomerania became Christian under saint Otto of Bamberg  the Apostle of the Pomeranians   at the same time Pomerelia became a part of diocese of Włocławek  Since then  the Griffin Duchy of Pomerania stayed with the Holy Roman Empire and the Principality of Rugia with Denmark  while Pomerelia  under the ruling of Samborides  was a part of Poland  The Teutonic Knights succeeded in integrating Pomerelia into their monastic state in the early 14th century  Meanwhile the Ostsiedlung started to turn Slavic narrow Pomerania into an increasingly German settled area  the remaining Wends and Polish people  often known as Kashubians  continued to settle within the Pomerelia  In 1325 the line of the princes of Rügen died out  and the principality was inherited by the Griffins  In 1466  with the Teutonic Order s defeat  Pomerelia became again subject to the Polish Crown as a part of Royal Prussia  While the German population in the Duchy of Pomerania adopted the Protestant reformation in 1534  the Polish  along with Kashubian  population remained with the Roman Catholic Church  The Thirty Years  War severely ravaged and depopulated narrow Pomerania  few years later this same happened to Pomerelia  the Deluge   With the extinction of the Griffin house during the same period  the Duchy of Pomerania was divided between the Swedish Empire and Brandenburg Prussia in 1648  while Pomerelia remained in with the Polish Crown   File Nikolaikirche Rathaus HST jpg Stralsund  one of

remainder of Swedish Pomerania in 1815  after the Napoleonic Wars was lifted  The former Brandenburg Prussian Pomerania and the former Swedish parts were reorganized into the Prussian Province of Pomerania  while Pomerelia was made part of the Province of West Prussia  With Prussia  both provinces joined the newly constituted German Empire in 1871  Under the German rule Polish population suffered discrimination and oppressive measures aimed at eradicating its culture  Following the empire s defeat in World War I  Pomorze Gdańskie Pomerelia returned again to the rebuilt Polish state  now the region called by the Germans as the Polish Corridor   while Gdansk Danzig was transformed into the Free City of Danzig  Germany s Province of Pomerania was expanded in 1938 to include northern parts of the former Province of Posen–West Prussia  and in 1939 the annexed Pomorze Gdańskie Polish Corridor became part of the wartime Reichsgau Danzig West Prussia  The Nazis deported the Pomeranian Jews to a reservation near Lublin and  in Pomerelia  mass murdered Jews  as well as Poles  as Nazi Germany considered them to be untermenschen  sub human  races  The Polish population suffered heavily from the German Nazi oppression   more than 40 000 people died in executions  death camps  prisons and forced labour  primarily teachers  businessmen  priests  politicians  former army officers  and civil servants  Thousands of Poles and Kashubians suffered deportation  their homes taken by the German military and civil servants  as well as some East Germans resettled between 1940 1943   After Nazi Germany s defeat in World War II  the German–Polish border was shifted west to the Oder–Neisse line and all of Pomerania was under Soviet military control  The German population of the areas east of the line was expelled  and the area was resettled primarily with Poles  some themselves expellees from former eastern Poland  and some Ukrainians  resettled under Operation Vistula  and Jews  Most of Western Pomerania  Vorpommern  remained in Germany and today forms the eastern part of the state of Mecklenburg Vorpommern  while the Polish part of the region is divided between the West Pomeranian and Pomeranian voivodeships  with their capitals in Szczecin and Gdańsk  respectively  During the 1980s  the Solidarity and Die Wende   the change   movements overthrew the Communist regimes implemented during the post war era  since then  Pomerania is democratically governed   4  Demographics  Western Pomerania is inhabited by German Pomeranians  In the eastern parts  Poles are
