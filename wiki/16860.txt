A is one of several types of traditionally made swords from Japan  There are many types of Japanese swords that differ by size  shape  field of application and method of manufacture  Some of the more commonly known types of Japanese swords are the katana  wakizashi  and tachi   1  Types  For nihonto  the type classifications indicate the combination of a blade and its mounts  as this then determines the style of use of the blade  An unsigned and shortened blade that was once made and intended for use as a tachi  may be alternately mounted in tachi koshirae and katana koshirae  It is properly distinguished then by the style of mount it currently inhabits  A long tanto may be classified as a wakizashi due to its length being over 30 cm  however it may have originally been mounted and used as a tanto  making the length distinction somewhat arbitrary but necessary when referring to unmounted short blades to avoid ambiguity  When the mounts are taken out of the equation a tanto and wakizashi will be determined by length under or over 30 cm  unless their intended use can be absolutely determined or the speaker is rendering an opinion on the intended use of the blade  In this way a blade formally attributed as a wakizashi due to length may be informally discussed between individuals as a tanto  because the blade was made during an age where tanto were popular and the wakizashi as a companion sword to katana did not yet exist   The following are types of Japanese swords     A straight single edged sword that was produced prior to the 10th century  and without differential hardening or folding     A straight two edged sword that was produced prior to the 10th century  and may be without differential hardening or folding     A sword that is generally longer and more curved than the later katana  with curvature centered from the middle or towards the tang  and often including the tang  Tachi were worn suspended  with the edge downward  The tachi was in vogue before the 1400s     A shorter version of the tachi  but with similar mounts and intended use  mostly found in the 1200s or earlier      Very large tachi  some in excess of 100 cm  and usually a blade of the late 1300s     A development from the tachi in the 1400s  Worn with the edge upwards in the obi     A short type of uchigatana developed in the 1500s  with short tang  intended for one handed use  One of the forerunners of the wakizashi     A general term for the traditional sword with a curved blade longer than 60 cm  there is no upper length limit but generally they are shorter than 80 cm   worn with the edge upwards in the obi  Developed from the uchigatana and the sword of the samurai class of the Edo period  1600s to late 1800s      A general term for a sword between one and two shaku long  30 cm and 60 cm in modern measurement   predominantly made after 1600  Generally it is the short blade that accompanies a katana in the traditional samurai daisho pairing of swords  but may be worn by classes other than the samurai as a single blade  also worn edge up as the katana  It should be noted that there are Japanese bladed weapons made in the same traditional manner as other Japanese swords and they are also considered to be swords  these include     A polearm similar to a naginata  but with a straighter blade  more like that of a tachi or katana  and mounted with a wrapped handle similar to a highly exaggerated katana handle  The name refers to the style of mount as well as a blade type which means that a naginata blade could be mounted in a nagamaki mount and be considered a nagamaki  Nagamaki naoshi refers to a nagamaki blade that has been reshaped into a katana or wakizashi  they are mounted in a Japanese sword koshirae     A polearm with a curved single edged blade  Naginata mounts consist of a long wooden pole  different from a nagamaki mount  which is shorter and wrapped  Naginata naoshi refers to a naginata blade that has been reshaped into a katana or wakizashi  they are mounted in a Japanese sword koshirae     A spear  or spear like polearm  Yari have various blade forms  from a simple double edged and flat blade  to a triangular cross section double edged blade  to those with a symmetric cross piece  jumonji yari  or those with an asymmetric cross piece  The main blade is symmetric and straight unlike a naginata  and usually smaller but can be as large or bigger than some naginata blades     A knife or dagger  Usually one edged  but some were double edged  though asymmetrical     Usually a tanto or wakizashi length religious or ceremonial blade  with a gentle leaf shape and point  but some may be larger and can also refer to old pre curve types of swords as above  Symmetrical and double edged  Arrowheads for war  yajiri  were also made using the same methods as nihontō   2  Description  The production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods   Jokoto  ancient swords  until around 900 A D    Koto  old swords from around 900–1596   Shinto  new swords 1596–1780   Shinshinto  new new swords 1781–1876   Gendaito  modern swords 1876–1945   Shinsakuto  newly made swords 1953–present  In modern times the most commonly known type of Japanese sword is the Shinogi Zukuri katana  which is a single edged and usually curved long sword traditionally worn by samurai from the 15th century onwards  Other types of Japanese swords include  tsurugi or ken  which is a double edged sword  ōdachi  nodachi  tachi  which are older styles of a very long single edged sword  wakizashi  a medium sized sword and tantō which is an even smaller knife sized sword  Naginata and yari despite being pole arms are still considered to be swords   Japanese swords are still commonly seen today  antique and modern forged swords can easily be found and purchased  Modern  authentic nihontō are made by a few hundred swordsmiths  Many examples can be seen at an annual competition hosted by the All Japan Swordsmith Association  under the auspices of the Nihontō Bunka Shinkō Kyōkai  Society for the promotion of Japanese Sword Culture    3  Etymology  The word katana was used in ancient Japan and is still used today  whereas the old usage of the word nihontō is found in the poem  the Song of Nihontō  by the Song Dynasty poet Ouyang Xiu  The word nihontō became more common in Japan in the late Tokugawa shogunate  Due to importation of Western swords  the word nihontō was adopted in order to distinguish it from the    Meibutsu  noted swords  is a special designation given to sword masterpieces which are listed in a compilation from the 1700s called the  Kyoho Meibutsucho   The swords listed are Koto blades from several different provinces  100 of the 166 swords listed are known to exist today with Soshu blades being very well represented  The  Kyoho Meibutsucho  also listed the nicknames  prices  history and length of the Meibutsy with swords by Yoshimitsu  Masamune  Yoshihiro  and Sadamune being very highly priced   4  Anatomy  4 1  Blade  Each blade has a unique profile  mostly dependent on the swordsmith and the construction method  The most prominent part is the middle ridge  or shinogi  In the earlier picture  the examples were flat to the shinogi  then tapering to the blade  However  swords could narrow down to the shinogi  then narrow further to the blade  or even expand outward towards the shinogi then shrink to the blade  producing a trapezoidal shape   A flat or narrowing shinogi is called shinogi hikushi  whereas a fat blade is called a shinogi takushi   The shinogi can be placed near the back of the blade for a longer  sharper  more fragile tip or a more moderate shinogi near the center of the blade   The sword also has an exact tip shape  which is considered an extremely important characteristic  the tip can be long  ōkissaki   medium  chūkissaki   short  kokissaki   or even hooked backwards  ikuri ōkissaki   In addition  whether the front edge of the tip is more curved  fukura tsuku  or  relatively  straight  fukura kareru  is also important   The kissaki  point  is not a  chisel like  point  nor is the Western knife interpretation of a  tantō point  found on true Japanese swords  a straight  linearly sloped point has the advantage of being easy to grind  but it bears only a superficial similarity to traditional Japanese kissaki  Kissaki have a curved profile  and smooth three dimensional curvature across their surface towards the edge—though they are bounded by a straight line called the yokote and have crisp definition at all their edges   Although it is not commonly known  the  chisel point  kissaki originated in Japan  Examples of such are shown in the book  The Japanese Sword  by Kanzan Sato  Because American bladesmiths use this design extensively it is a common misconception that the design originated in America   A hole is punched through the tang nakago  called a mekugi ana  It is used to anchor the blade using a mekugi  a small bamboo pin that is inserted into another cavity in the handle tsuka and through the mekugi ana  thus restricting the blade from slipping out  To remove the tsuka one removes the mekugi  The swordsmith s signature mei is carved on the nakago  tang    4 2  Mountings  In Japanese  the scabbard for a nihontō is referred to as a saya  and the handguard piece  often intricately designed as an individual work of art—especially in later years of the Edo period—was called the tsuba  Other aspects of the mountings  koshirae   such as the menuki  decorative grip swells   habaki  blade collar and scabbard wedge   fuchi and kashira  handle collar and cap   kozuka  small utility knife handle   kogai  decorative skewer like implement   saya lacquer  and tsuka ito  professional handle wrap  also named tsukamaki   received similar levels of artistry   5  Classification  5 1  Length  What generally differentiates the different swords is their length  Japanese swords are measured in units of shaku  Since 1891  the modern Japanese  shaku  is approximately equal to a foot  11 93 inches   calibrated with the meter to equal exactly 10 meters per 33 shaku  30 30 cm    However the historical shaku was slightly longer  13 96 inches or 35 45 cm   Thus  there may sometimes be confusion about the blade lengths  depending on which shaku value is being assumed when converting to metric or U S  customary measurements   The three main divisions of Japanese blade length are   1 shaku or less for tantō  knife or dagger    1–2 shaku for  wakizashi or kodachi    2 shaku or more for  long sword  such as katana or tachi   A blade shorter than one shaku is considered a tantō  knife   A blade longer than one shaku but less than two is considered a shōtō  short sword   The wakizashi and kodachi are in this category  The length is measured in a straight line across the back of the blade from tip to munemachi  where blade meets tang   Most blades that fall into the  shōtō  size range are wakizashi  However  some daitō were designed with blades slightly shorter than 2 shaku  These were called kodachi and are somewhere in between a true daitō and a wakizashi  A shōtō and a daitō together are called a daishō  literally   big and small    The daishō was the symbolic armament of the Edo period samurai   A blade longer than two shaku is considered a daitō  or long sword  To qualify as a daitō the sword must have a blade longer than 2 shaku  approximately 24 inches or 60 centimeters  in a straight line  While there is a well defined lower limit to the length of a daitō  the upper limit is not well enforced  a number of modern historians  swordsmiths  etc  say that swords that are over 3 shaku in blade length are  longer than normal daitō  and are usually referred to or called ōdachi  The word  daitō  is often used when explaining the related terms shōtō  short sword  and daishō  the set of both large and small sword   Miyamoto Musashi refers to the long sword in The Book of Five Rings  He is referring to the katana in this  and refers to the nodachi and the odachi as  extra long swords    Before about 1500 most swords were usually worn suspended from cords on a belt  edge down  This style is called jindachi zukuri  and daitō worn in this fashion are called tachi  average blade length of 75–80 cm   From 1600 to 1867  more swords were worn through an obi  sash   paired with a smaller blade  both worn edge up  This style is called buke zukuri  and all daitō worn in this fashion are katana  averaging 70–74 cm  2 shaku 3 sun to 2 shaku 4 sun 5 bu  in blade length  However  nihontō of longer lengths also existed  including lengths up to 78 cm  2 shaku 5 sun 5 bu   The weight of a nihontō rarely exceeded 1 kg without the saya   It was not simply that the swords were worn by cords on a belt  as a  style  of sorts  Such a statement trivializes an important function of such a manner of bearing the sword  It was a very direct example of  form following function   At this point in Japanese history  much of the warfare was fought on horseback  Being so  if the sword blade were in a more vertical position  it would be cumbersome  and awkward to draw  Suspending the sword by  cords   allowed the sheath to be more horizontal  and far less likely to bind while drawing it in that position   Abnormally long blades  longer than 3 shaku   usually carried across the back  are called ōdachi or nodachi  The word ōdachi is also sometimes used as a synonym for nihontō  Odachi means  Great Sword   and Nodachi translates to  Field sword   Nodachi were used during war as the longer sword gave a foot soldier a reach advantage  but now nodachi are illegal because of their effectiveness as a killing weapon  Citizens are not allowed to possess an odachi unless it is for ceremonial purposes   Here is a list of lengths for different types of blades   Nodachi  Ōdachi  Jin tachi  90 cm and over  more than three shaku   Tachi  Katana  over 60 6 cm  more than two shaku   Wakizashi  between 30 3 and 60 6 cm  between one and two shaku   Tantō  Aikuchi  under 30 3 cm  under one shaku  Blades whose length is next to a different classification type are described with a prefix  O    for great  or  Ko    for small   e g  a Wakizashi with a length of 59 cm is called an O wakizashi  almost a Katana  whereas a Katana with 61 cm is called a Ko Katana  for small Katana    Since 1867  restrictions and or the deconstruction of the samurai class meant that most blades have been worn jindachi zukuri style  like Western navy officers  Since 1953  there has been a resurgence in the buke zukuri style  permitted only for demonstration purposes   5 2  School  Most old Japanese swords can be traced back to one of five provinces  each of which had its own school  traditions and  trademarks   e g   the swords from Mino province were  from the start famous for their sharpness    These schools are known as Gokaden  The Five Traditions   These traditions and provinces are as follows   Sōshū School  known for itame hada and midareba hamon in nie deki   Yamato School  known for masame hada and suguha hamon in nie deki   Bizen School  known for mokume hada and midareba hamon in nioi deki   Yamashiro School  known for mokume hada and suguha hamon in nei deki   Mino School  known for hard mokume hada and midareba mixed with togari ba  In the Kotō era there were several other schools that did not fit within the Gokaden or were known to mix elements of each Gokaden  and they were called wakimono  small school   There were 19 commonly referenced wakimono   6  History  The production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods  jokoto  ancient swords  until around 900 A D    koto  old swords from around 900–1596   shinto  new swords 1596–1780   shinshinto  new new swords 1781–1876   gendaito  modern swords 1876–1945   and shinsakuto  newly made swords 1953–present    6 1  Early history  Early examples of Japanese swords were straight chokutō or jōkotō and others with unusual shapes their styles and forging techniques probably are derived from ancient China during 1st~8th centuries and some of them are directly imported form China through trade In the Heian period  8th to 11th centuries  sword making developed through techniques brought over from Ainu through trade in the 8th century   warabitetō  kenukigata warabitetō  kenukigata tachi   Swords forged between 987 and 1597 are called  lit    old swords    these are considered the pinnacle of Japanese swordcraft  Early models had uneven curves with the deepest part of the curve at the hilt  As eras changed the center of the curve tended to move up the blade   The nihonto as we know it today with its deep  graceful curve has its origin in shinogi zukuri  single edged blade with ridgeline  tachi which were developed sometime around the middle of the Heian period to service the need of the growing military class  Its shape reflects the changing form of warfare in Japan  Cavalry were now the predominant fighting unit and the older straight chokutō were particularly unsuitable for fighting from horseback  The curved sword is a far more efficient weapon when wielded by a warrior on horseback where the curve of the blade adds considerably to the downward force of a cutting action   The tachi is a sword which is generally larger than a katana  and is worn suspended with the cutting edge down  This was the standard form of carrying the sword for centuries  and would eventually be displaced by the katana style where the blade was worn thrust through the belt  edge up  The tachi was worn slung across the left hip  The signature on the tang  nakago  of the blade was inscribed in such a way that it would always be on the outside of the sword when worn  This characteristic is important in recognising the development  function and different styles of wearing swords from this time onwards   When worn with full armour  the tachi would be accompanied by a shorter blade in the form known as koshigatana   waist sword    a type of short sword with no hand guard  tsuba  and where the hilt and scabbard meet to form the style of mounting called an aikuchi   meeting mouth    Daggers  tantō   were also carried for close combat fighting as well as carried generally for personal protection   The Mongol invasions of Japan in the 13th century spurred further evolution of the Japanese sword  Often forced to abandon traditional mounted archery for hand to hand combat  many samurai found that their swords were too delicate and prone to damage when used against the thick leather armor of the invaders  In response  Japanese swordsmiths started to adopt thinner and simpler temper lines  Certain Japanese swordsmiths of this period began to make blades with thicker backs and bigger points as a response to the Mongol threat   By the 15th century  the Sengoku Jidai civil war erupted  and the vast need for swords together with the ferocity of the fighting caused the highly artistic techniques of the Kamakura period  known as the  Golden Age of Swordmaking   to be abandoned in favor of more utilitarian and disposable weapons  The export of nihontō reached its height during the Muromachi period when at least 200 000 nihontō were shipped to Ming Dynasty China in official trade in an attempt to soak up the production of Japanese weapons and make it harder for pirates in the area to arm   In the 15th and 16th centuries  samurai who increasingly found a need for a sword for use in closer quarters along with increasing use of foot soldiers armed with spears led to the creation of the uchigatana  in both one handed and two handed forms  As the Sengoku civil wars progressed  the uchigatana evolved into the modern katana  and replaced the tachi as the primary weapon of the samurai  especially when not wearing armor  Many longer tachi were shortened in the 15th–17th centuries to meet the demand for katana   The craft decayed as time progressed and firearms were introduced as a decisive force on the battlefield  At the end of the Muromachi period  the Tokugawa shoguns issued regulations controlling who could own and carry swords  and effectively standardized the description of a nihontō   6 2  New swords  In times of peace  swordsmiths returned to the making of refined and artistic blades  and the beginning of the Momoyama period saw the return of high quality creations  As the techniques of the ancient smiths had been lost during the previous period of war  these swords were called   literally  new swords   Generally they are considered inferior to most kotō   old swords    and coincide with a decline in manufacturing skills  As the Edo period progressed  blade quality declined  though ornamentation was refined  Originally  simple and tasteful engravings known as horimono were added for religious reasons  Later  in the more complex work found on many shintō  form no longer strictly followed function   Under the isolationist Tokugawa shogunate  swordmaking and the use of firearms declined  The master swordsmith Suishinshi Masahide  c  1750–1825  published opinions that the arts and techniques of the shintō swords were inferior to the kotō blades  and that research should be made by all swordsmiths to rediscover the lost techniques  Masahide traveled the land teaching what he knew to all who would listen  and swordsmiths rallied to his cause and ushered in a second renaissance in Japanese sword smithing   With the discarding of the shintō style  and the re introduction of old and rediscovered techniques  swords made in the kotō style between 1761 and 1876 are    new revival swords  or literally  new new swords   These are considered superior to most shintō  but inferior to true kotō   The arrival of Matthew Perry in 1853 and the subsequent Convention of Kanagawa forcibly reintroduced Japan to the outside world  the rapid modernization of the Meiji Restoration soon followed  The Haitorei edict in 1876 all but banned carrying swords and guns on streets  Overnight  the market for swords died  many swordsmiths were left without a trade to pursue  and valuable skills were lost  The nihontō remained in use in some occupations such as the police force  At the same time  kendo was incorporated into police training so that police officers would have at least the training necessary to properly use one   In time  it was rediscovered that soldiers needed to be armed with swords  and over the decades at the beginning of the 20th century swordsmiths again found work  These swords  derisively called guntō  were often oil tempered  or simply stamped out of steel and given a serial number rather than a chiseled signature  The mass produced ones often look like Western cavalry sabers rather than nihontō  with blades slightly shorter than blades of the shintō and shinshintō periods  Military swords hand made in the traditional way are often termed as gendaitō  The craft of making swords was kept alive through the efforts of a few individuals  notably Gassan Sadakazu  月山貞一  1836–1918  and Gassan Sadakatsu  月山貞勝  1869–1943   who were employed as Imperial artisans  These smiths produced fine works that stand with the best of the older blades for the Emperor and other high ranking officials  The students of Sadakatsu went on to be designated Intangible Cultural Assets   Living National Treasures   as they embodied knowledge that was considered to be fundamentally important to the Japanese identity  In 1934 the Japanese government issued a military specification for the shin guntō  new army sword   the first version of which was the Type 94 Katana  and many machine  and hand crafted swords used in World War II conformed to this and later shin guntō specifications   7  Post samurai military swords  File Japanese army sabre jpg kyu guntō army sabre File Gunto type 98 jpg  Type 98  officer s sword File Sabre

with edges was banned except under police or government permit  The ban was overturned through a personal appeal by Dr  Junji Honma  During a meeting with General Douglas MacArthur  Dr  Honma produced blades from the various periods of Japanese history and MacArthur was able to identify very quickly what blades held artistic merit and which could be considered purely weapons  As a result of this meeting  the ban was amended so that guntō weapons would be destroyed while swords of artistic merit could be owned and preserved  Even so  many nihontō were sold to American soldiers at a bargain price  in 1958 there were more Japanese swords in America than in Japan  The vast majority of these one million or more swords were guntō  but there were still a sizable number of older swords   After the Edo period  swordsmiths turned increasingly to the production of civilian goods  The Occupation and its regulations almost put an end to the production of nihonto  A few smiths continued their trade  and Dr  Honma went on to be a founder of the   who made it their mission to preserve the old techniques and blades  Thanks to the efforts of other like minded individuals  the nihontō did not disappear  many swordsmiths continued the work begun by Masahide  and the old swordmaking techniques were rediscovered   Modern nihonto manufactured according to traditional methods are usually known as   meaning  newly made swords   Alternatively  they can be termed when they are designed for combat as opposed to iaitō training swords   Due to their popularity in modern media  display only  nihontō  have become widespread in the sword marketplace  Ranging from small letter openers to scale replica  wallhangers   these items are commonly made from stainless steel  which makes them either brittle or poor at holding an edge  and have either a blunt or very crude edge  There are accounts of good quality stainless steel nihontō  however  these are rare at best  Some replica nihontō have been used in modern day armed robberies  which helped contribute to the enactment of a ban on sale  import and hire of samurai swords in the UK  As a part of marketing  modern ahistoric blade styles and material properties are often stated as traditional and genuine  promulgating disinformation   In Japan  genuine edged hand made Japanese swords  whether antique or modern  are classified as art objects  and not weapons  and must have accompanying certification in order to be legally owned  Some companies and independent smiths outside of Japan produce katana as well  with varying levels of quality   8  Manufacturing  Nihontō and wakizashi were often forged with different profiles  different blade thicknesses  and varying amounts of grind  Wakizashi were not simply scaled down nihontō  they were often forged in hira zukuri or other such forms which were very rare on nihontō   The daishō was not always forged together  If a samurai was able to afford a daishō  it was often composed of whichever two swords could be conveniently acquired  sometimes by different smiths and in different styles  Even when a daishō contained a pair of blades by the same smith  they were not always forged as a pair or mounted as one  Daishō made as a pair  mounted as a pair  and owned worn as a pair  are therefore uncommon and considered highly valuable  especially if they still retain their original mountings  as opposed to later mountings  even if the later mounts are made as a pair    The forging of a Japanese blade typically took weeks or even months and was considered a sacred art  As with many complex endeavors  rather than a single craftsman  several artists were involved  There was a smith to forge the rough shape  often a second smith  apprentice  to fold the metal  a specialist polisher  called a togi  as well as the various artisans that made the koshirae  the various fittings used to decorate the finished blade and saya  sheath  including the tsuka  hilt   fuchi  collar   kashira  pommel   and tsuba  hand guard    It is said that the sharpening and polishing process takes just as long as the forging of the blade itself   The legitimate Japanese sword is made from Japanese steel  Tamahagane   The most common lamination method the Japanese sword blade is formed from is a combination of two different steels  a harder outer jacket of steel wrapped around a softer inner core of steel  This creates a blade which has a hard  razor sharp cutting edge with the ability to absorb shock in a way which reduces the possibility of the blade breaking when used in combat  The hadagane  for the outer skin of the blade  is produced by heating a block of raw steel  which is then hammered out into a bar  and the flexible back portion  This is then cooled and broken up into smaller blocks which are checked for further impurities and then reassembled and reforged  During this process the billet of steel is heated and hammered  split and folded back upon itself many times and re welded to create a complex structure of many thousands of layers  Each different steel is folded differently  in order to provide the necessary strength and flexibility to the different steels  The precise way in which the steel is folded  hammered and re welded determines the distinctive grain pattern of the blade  the jihada   also called jigane when referring to the actual surface of the steel blade  a feature which is indicative of the period  place of manufacture and actual maker of the blade  The practice of folding also ensures a somewhat more homogeneous product  with the carbon in the steel being evenly distributed and the steel having no voids that could lead to fractures and failure of the blade in combat  The shingane  for the inner core of the blade  is of a relatively softer steel with a lower carbon content than the hadagane  For this  the block is again hammered  folded and welded in a similar fashion to the hadagane  but with fewer folds  At this point  the hadagane block is once again heated  hammered out and folded into a ‘U’ shape  into which the shingane is inserted to a point just short of the tip  The new composite steel billet is then heated and hammered out ensuring that no air or dirt is trapped between the two layers of steel  The bar increases in length during this process until it approximates the final size and shape of the finished sword blade  A triangular section is cut off from the tip of the bar and shaped to create what will be the kissaki  At this point in the process  the blank for the blade is of rectangular section  This rough shape is referred to as a sunobe   The sunobe is again heated  section by section and hammered to create a shape which has many of the recognisable characteristics of the finished blade  These are a thick back  mune   a thinner edge  ha   a curved tip  kissaki   notches on the edge  hamachi  and back  munemachi  which separate the blade from the tang  nakago   Details such as the ridge line  shinogi  another distinctive characteristic of the Japanese sword  are added at this stage of the process  The smith’s skill at this point comes into play as the hammering process causes the blade to naturally curve in an erratic way  the thicker back tending to curve towards the thinner edge  and he must skillfully control the shape to give it the required upward curvature  The sunobe is finished by a process of filing and scraping which leaves all the physical characteristics and shapes of the blade recognisable  The surface of the blade is left in a relatively rough state  ready for the hardening processes  The sunobe is then covered all over with a clay mixture which is applied more thickly along the back and sides of the blade than along the edge  The blade is left to dry while the smith prepares the forge for the final heat treatment of the blade  the yaki ire  the hardening of the cutting edge   This process takes place in a darkened smithy  traditionally at night  in order that the smith can judge by eye the colour and therefore the temperature of the sword as it is repeatedly passed through the glowing charcoal  When the time is deemed right  traditionally the blade should be the colour of the moon in February and August which are the two months that appear most commonly on dated inscriptions on the nakago of the Japanese sword   the blade is plunged edge down and point forward into a tank of water  The precise time taken to heat the sword  the temperature of the blade and of the water into which it is plunged are all individual to each smith and they have generally been closely guarded secrets  Legend tells of a particular smith who cut off his apprentice’s hand for testing the temperature of the water he used for the hardening process  In the different schools of swordmakers there are many subtle variations in the materials used in the various processes and techniques outlined above  specifically in the form of clay applied to the blade prior to the yaki ire  but all follow the same general procedures   The application of the clay in different thicknesses to the blade allows the steel to cool more quickly along the thinner coated edge when plunged into the tank of water and thereby develop into the harder form of steel called martensite  which can be ground to razor like sharpness  The thickly coated back cools more slowly retaining the pearlite steel characteristics of relative softness and flexibility  The precise way in which the clay is applied  and partially scraped off at the edge  is a determining factor in the formation of the shape and features of the crystalline structure known as the hamon  This distinctive tempering line found near the edge of the Japanese blade is one of the main characteristics to be assessed when examining a blade   The martensitic steel which forms from the edge of the blade to the hamon is in effect the transition line between these two different forms of steel  and is where most of the shapes  colours and beauty in the steel of the Japanese sword are to be found  The variations in the form and structure of the hamon are all indicative of the period  smith  school or place of manufacture of the sword  As well as the aesthetic qualities of the hamon  there are  perhaps not unsurprisingly  real practical functions  The hardened edge is where most of any potential damage to the blade will occur in battle  This hardened edge is capable of being reground and sharpened many times  although the process will alter the shape of the blade  Altering the shape will allow more resistance when fighting in hand to hand combat   Almost all blades are decorated  although not all blades are decorated on the visible part of the blade  Once the blade is cool  and the mud is scraped off  the blade may have designs or grooves  hi or bo hi  cut into it  One of the most important markings on the sword is performed here  the file markings  These are cut into the nakago or the hilt section of the blade  where they will be covered by the tsuka later  The nakago is never supposed to be cleaned  doing this can reduce the value of the sword by half or more  The purpose is to show how well the blade steel ages   Some other marks on the blade are aesthetic  dedications written in kanji as well as engravings called horimono depicting gods  dragons  or other acceptable beings  Some are more practical  The presence of a groove  the most basic type is called a hi  reduces the weight of the sword yet keeps its structural integrity and strength   9  Use  The tachi became the primary weapon on the battlefield during the Kamakura period  used by cavalry mounted samurai  The sword was mostly considered as a secondary weapon until then  used in the battlefield only after the bow and spear were no longer feasible  During the Edo period samurai went about on foot unarmored  and with much less combat being fought on horseback in open battlefields the need for an effective close quarter weapon resulted in samurai being armed with daishō   Testing of swords  called tameshigiri  was practiced on a variety of materials  often the bodies of executed criminals  to test the sword s sharpness and practice cutting technique   Kenjutsu is the Japanese martial art of using the nihontō in combat  The nihontō was primarily a cutting weapon  or more specifically  a slicing one  However  the nihontō s moderate curve allows for effective thrusting as well  The hilt of the nihontō was held with two hands  though a fair amount of one handed techniques exist  The placement of the right hand was dictated by both the length of the tsuka and the length of the wielder s arm  Two other martial arts were developed specifically for training to draw the sword and attack in one motion  They are battōjutsu and iaijutsu  which are superficially similar  but do generally differ in training theory and methods   For cutting  there was a specific technique called  ten uchi   Ten uchi refers to an organized motion made by arms and wrist  during a descending strike  As the sword is swung downwards  the elbow joint drastically extends at the last instant  popping the sword into place  This motion causes the swordsman s grip to twist slightly and if done correctly  is said to feel like wringing a towel  Thomas Hooper sensei reference   This motion itself caused the nihontō s blade to impact its target with sharp force  and is used to break initial resistance  From there  fluidly continuing along the motion wrought by ten uchi  the arms would follow through with the stroke  dragging the sword through its target  Because the nihontō slices rather than chops  it is this  dragging  which allows it to do maximum damage  and is thus incorporated into the cutting technique  At full speed  the swing will appear to be full stroke  the nihontō passing through the targeted object  The segments of the swing are hardly visible  if at all  Assuming that the target is  for example  a human torso  ten uchi will break the initial resistance supplied by shoulder muscles and the clavicle  The follow through would continue the slicing motion  through whatever else it would encounter  until the blade inherently exited the body  due to a combination of the motion and its curved shape  Nearly all styles of kenjutsu share the same five basic guard postures  They are as follows  chūdan no kamae  middle posture   jōdan no kamae  high posture   gedan no kamae  low posture   hassō no kamae  eight sided posture   and waki gamae  side posture    The nihontō s razor edge was so hard that upon hitting an equally hard or harder object  such as another sword s edge  chipping became a definite risk  As such  blocking an oncoming blow blade to blade was generally avoided  In fact  evasive body maneuvers were preferred over blade contact by most  but  if such was not possible  the flat or the back of the blade was used for defense in many styles  rather than the precious edge  A popular method for defeating descending slashes was to simply beat the sword aside  In some instances  an  umbrella block   positioning the blade overhead  diagonally  point towards the ground  pommel towards the sky   would create an effective shield against a descending strike  If the angle of the block was drastic enough  the curve of the nihontō s spine would cause the attacker s blade to slide along its counter and off to the side   9 1  Carrying  Nihontō were carried in several different ways  varying throughout Japanese history  The style most commonly seen in  samurai  movies is called buke zukuri  with the nihontō  and wakizashi  if also present  carried edge up  with the saya  sheath  thrust through the obi  sash    The nihontō would be carried in a saya  sheath  and tucked into the samurai s belt  Originally  they would carry the sword with the blade turned down  This was a more comfortable way for the armored samurai to carry his very long sword or to draw while mounted  The bulk of the samurai armor made it difficult to draw the sword from any other place on his body  When unarmored  samurai would carry their sword with the blade facing up  This made it possible to draw the sword and strike in one quick motion  In one such method of drawing the sword  the samurai would turn the saya  sheath  downward ninety degrees and pull it out of his obi  sash  just a bit with his left hand  then gripping the tsuka  hilt  with his right hand he would slide it out while sliding the saya  sheath  back to its original position   10  Gallery  File Daisho tsuka 1 jpg Tsuka  wakizashi and katana  File Soie wakisashi p1000658 jpg Nakago  tang  of a wakizashi blade  showing a habaki  blade collar   File Tachi
