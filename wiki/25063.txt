In mathematics  it is possible to combine several rings into one large product ring  This is done as follows  if I is some index set and Ri is a ring for every i in I  then the cartesian product can be turned into a ring by defining the operations coordinate wise   The resulting ring is called a direct product of the rings Ri  The direct product of finitely many rings coincides with the direct sum of rings   1  Examples  An important example is the ring Z nZ of integers modulo n  If n is written as a product of prime powers  see fundamental theorem of arithmetic    where the pi are distinct primes  then Z nZ is naturally isomorphic to the product ring  This follows from the Chinese remainder theorem   2  Properties  If is a product of rings  then for every i in I we have a surjective ring homomorphism which projects the product on the ith coordinate  The product R  together with the projections pi  has the following universal property   This shows that the product of rings is an instance of products in the sense of category theory  However  despite also being called the direct sum of rings when I is finite  the product of rings is not a coproduct in the sense of category theory  In particular  if I has more than one element  the inclusion map is not ring homomorphism as it does not map the identity in Ri to the identity in R   If Ai in Ri is an ideal for each i in I  then is an ideal of R  If I is finite  then the converse is true  i e  every ideal of R is of this form  However  if I is infinite and the rings Ri are non zero  then the converse is false  the set of elements with all but finitely many nonzero coordinates forms an ideal which is not a direct product of ideals of the Ri  The ideal A is a prime ideal in R if all but one of the Ai are equal to Ri and the remaining Ai is a prime ideal in Ri  However  the converse is not true when I is infinite  For example  the direct sum of the Ri form an ideal not contained in any such A  but the axiom of choice gives that it is contained in some maximal ideal which is a fortiori prime   An element x in R is a unit if and only if all of its components are units  i e  if and only if is a unit in Ri for every i in I  The group of units of R is the product of the groups of units of Ri   A product of more than one non zero rings always has zero divisors  if x is an element of the product all of whose coordinates are zero except   and y is an element of the product with all coordinates zero except  with    then in the product ring   3  See also  Direct product  4  Notes  5  References
