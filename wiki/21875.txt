The Nuremberg trials were a series of military tribunals  held by the Allied forces after World War II  most notable for the prosecution of prominent members of the political  military  and economic leadership of Nazi Germany  The trials were held in the city of Nuremberg  Germany  The first  and best known of these trials  described as  the greatest trial in history  by Norman Birkett  one of the British judges who presided over it  was the trial of the major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal  IMT   Held between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946  the Tribunal was given the task of trying 23 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich  though one of the defendants  Martin Bormann  was tried in absentia  while another  Robert Ley  committed suicide within a week of the trial s commencement  Not included were Adolf Hitler  Heinrich Himmler  and Joseph Goebbels  all of whom had committed suicide several months before the indictment was signed  The second set of trials of lesser war criminals was conducted under Control Council Law No  10 at the U S  Nuremberg Military Tribunals  NMT   among these included the Doctors  Trial and the Judges  Trial  This article primarily deals with the IMT  see Subsequent Nuremberg Trials for details on those trials   1  Origin  A precedent for trying those accused of war crimes had been set at the end of World War I in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials held in May to July 1921 before the Reichsgericht  German Supreme Court  in Leipzig  although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual  At the beginning of 1940  the Polish government in exile asked the British and French governments to condemn the German invasion of their country  The British initially declined to do so  however  in April 1940  a joint British French Polish declaration was issued  Relatively bland because of Anglo French reservations  it proclaimed the trio s  desire to make a formal and public protest to the conscience of the world against the action of the German government whom they must hold responsible for these crimes which cannot remain unpunished    Three and a half years later  the stated intention to punish the Germans was much more trenchant  On 1 November 1943  the Soviet Union  the United Kingdom and the United States published their  Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe   which gave a  full warning  that  when the Nazis were defeated  the Allies would  pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth     in order that justice may be done      The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the major war criminals whose offences have no particular geographical location and who will be punished by a joint decision of the Government of the Allies   This Allied intention to dispense justice was reiterated at the Yalta Conference and at Berlin in 1945   British War Cabinet documents  released on 2 January 2006  showed that as early as December 1944  the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured  British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had then advocated a policy of summary execution in some circumstances  with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles  being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war   In late 1943  during the Tripartite Dinner Meeting at the Tehran Conference  the Soviet leader  Joseph Stalin  proposed executing 50 000–100 000 German staff officers  US President Franklin D  Roosevelt joked that perhaps 49 000 would do  Churchill  believing them to be serious  denounced the idea of  the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country  and that he d rather be  taken out in the courtyard and shot  himself than partake in any such action  However  he also stated that war criminals must pay for their crimes and that in accordance with the Moscow Document which he himself had written  they should be tried at the places where the crimes were committed  Churchill was vigorously opposed to executions  for political purposes   According to the minutes of a Roosevelt Stalin meeting at Yalta  on 4 February 1945  at the Livadia Palace  President Roosevelt  said that he had been very much struck by the extent of German destruction in the Crimea and therefore he was more bloodthirsty in regard to the Germans than he had been a year ago  and he hoped that Marshal Stalin would again propose a toast to the execution of 50 000 officers of the German Army    US Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau  Jr  suggested a plan for the total denazification of Germany  this was known as the Morgenthau Plan  The plan advocated the forced de industrialisation of Germany and the summary execution of so called  arch criminals   i e  the major war criminals  Roosevelt initially supported this plan  and managed to convince Churchill to support it in a less drastic form  Later  details were leaked to the public  generating widespread protest  Roosevelt  aware of strong public disapproval  abandoned the plan  but did not adopt an alternative position on the matter  The demise of the Morgenthau Plan created the need for an alternative method of dealing with the Nazi leadership  The plan for the  Trial of European War Criminals  was drafted by Secretary of War Henry L  Stimson and the War Department  Following Roosevelt s death in April 1945  the new president  Harry S  Truman  gave strong approval for a judicial process  After a series of negotiations between Britain  the US  Soviet Union and France  details of the trial were worked out  The trials were to commence on 20 November 1945  in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg   2  Creation of the courts  On 14 January 1942  representatives from the nine countries occupied by Germany met in London to draft the  Inter Allied Resolution on German War Crimes   At the meetings in Tehran  1943   Yalta  1945  and Potsdam  1945   the three major wartime powers  the United Kingdom  United States  and the Soviet Union  agreed on the format of punishment for those responsible for war crimes during World War II  France was also awarded a place on the tribunal  The legal basis for the trial was established by the London Charter  which was agreed upon by the four so called Great Powers on 8 August 1945  and which restricted the trial to  punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis countries   Some 200 German war crimes defendants were tried at Nuremberg  and 1 600 others were tried under the traditional channels of military justice  The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany  Political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council which  having sovereign power over Germany  could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war  Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war  it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939   2 1  Location  Leipzig and Luxembourg were briefly considered as the location for the trial  The Soviet Union had wanted the trials to take place in Berlin  as the capital city of the  fascist conspirators   but Nuremberg was chosen as the site for two reasons  with the first one having been the decisive factor   The Palace of Justice was spacious and largely undamaged  one of the few buildings that had remained largely intact through extensive Allied bombing of Germany   and a large prison was also part of the complex   Nuremberg was considered the ceremonial birthplace of the Nazi Party  It had hosted the Party s annual propaganda rallies and the Reichstag session that passed the Nuremberg Laws  Thus it was considered a fitting place to mark the Party s symbolic demise  As a compromise with the Soviets  it was agreed that while the location of the trial would be Nuremberg  Berlin would be the official home of the Tribunal authorities  It was also agreed that France would become the permanent seat of the IMT and that the first trial  several were planned  would take place in Nuremberg   Most of the accused had previously been detained at Camp Ashcan  a processing station and interrogation center in Luxembourg  and were moved to Nuremberg for the trial   2 2  Participants  Each of the four countries provided one judge and an alternate  as well as a prosecutor   2 2 1  Judges  Major General

were Major Sir David Maxwell Fyfe and Sir John Wheeler Bennett  Mervyn Griffith Jones  later to become famous as the chief prosecutor in the Lady Chatterley s Lover obscenity trial  was also on Shawcross s team  Shawcross also recruited a young barrister  Anthony Marreco  who was the son of a friend of his  to help the British team with the heavy workload   2 2 3  Defense counsel  The vast majority of the defense attorneys were German lawyers  These included Georg Fröschmann  Heinz Fritz  Hans Fritzsche   Otto Kranzbühler  Karl Dönitz   Otto Pannenbecker  Wilhelm Frick   Alfred Thoma

Joachim von Ribbentrop   Walther Funk  Baldur von Schirach   Hanns Marx  Julius Streicher   Otto Nelte  and Herbert Kraus  The main counsels were supported by a total of 70 assistants  clerks and lawyers  The defense counsel witnesses included several men who took part in the war crimes during World War II  such as Rudolph Hoess  The men testifying for the defense hoped to receive more lenient sentences  All of the men testifying on behalf of the defense were found guilty on several counts   3  Trial  The International Military Tribunal was opened on November 19  1945  in the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg  The first session was presided over by the Soviet judge  Nikitchenko  The prosecution entered indictments against 24 major war criminals and seven organizations – the leadership of the Nazi party  the Reich Cabinet  the Schutzstaffel  SS   Sicherheitsdienst  SD   the Gestapo  the Sturmabteilung  SA  and the  General Staff and High Command   comprising several categories of senior military officers  These organizations were to be declared  criminal  if found guilty   The indictments were for   Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of a crime against peace  Planning  initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace  War crimes  Crimes against humanity The 24 accused were  with respect to each charge  either indicted but not convicted  I   indicted and found guilty  G   or not charged      as listed below by defendant  charge  and eventual outcome   3 1  Intelligence tests and psychiatric assessments  The Rorschach test was administered to the defendants  along with the Thematic Apperception Test and a German adaptation of the Wechsler Bellevue Intelligence Test  All were above average intelligence  several considerably   Throughout the trials  specifically between January and July 1946  the defendants and a number of witnesses were interviewed by American psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn  His notes detailing the demeanor and comments of the defendants survive  they were edited into book form and published in 2004   3 2  Overview of the trial  20 November 1945  Start of the trial   21 November

criminal organizations    31 August 1946  Last statements by the defendants   1 September 1946  The court adjourns   30 September   1 October 1946  The sentencing occurs  taking two days  with the individual sentences read out on the afternoon of October 1  The accusers were successful in unveiling the background of developments leading to the outbreak of World War II  which cost at least 40 million lives in Europe alone  as well as the extent of the atrocities committed in the name of the Hitler regime  Twelve of the accused were sentenced to death  seven received prison sentences  ranging from 10 years to life in prison   three were acquitted  and two were not charged   3 3  Executions  The death sentences were carried out 16 October 1946 by hanging using the standard drop method instead of long drop  The U S  army denied claims that the drop length was too short which caused the condemned to die slowly from strangulation instead of quickly from a broken neck  But evidence remains that some of the condemned men died agonizingly slowly taking from between 14 minutes to choke to death to as long as struggling for 28 minutes  The executioner was John C  Woods  Woods had hanged 34 U S  soldiers during the war  botching several of them  The executions took place in the gymnasium of the court building  demolished in 1983    Although the rumor has long persisted that the bodies were taken to Dachau and burned there  they were actually incinerated in a crematorium in Munich  and the ashes scattered over the river Isar  The French judges suggested that the military condemned  Göring  Keitel and Jodl  be shot dead by a firing squad  as is standard for military courts martial  but this was opposed by Biddle and the Soviet judges  who argued that the military officers had violated their military ethos and were not worthy of death by being shot  which was considered to be more dignified  The prisoners sentenced to incarceration were transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947   Of the 12 defendants sentenced to death by hanging  two were not hanged  Martin Bormann was convicted in absentia  he had been  unknown to the Allies  killed while trying to escape from Berlin in May 1945   and Hermann Göring committed suicide the night before the execution  The remaining 10 defendants sentenced to death were hanged   3 4  Nuremberg principles  The definition of what constitutes a war crime is described by the Nuremberg principles  a set of guidelines document which was created as a result of the trial  The medical experiments conducted by German doctors and prosecuted in the so called Doctors  Trial led to the creation of the Nuremberg Code to control future trials involving human subjects  a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation   Of the indicted organizations the following were found not to be criminal    The General Staff and High Command  was found not to comprise a group or organization as defined by Article 9 of the London Charter  Sturmabteilung  4  Subsidiary and related trials  The American authorities conducted subsequent Nuremberg Trials in their occupied zone   Other trials conducted after the Nuremberg Trials include the following   Dachau Trials  Auschwitz Trial  Belsen Trial  Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials  Mauthausen Gusen camp trials  Ravensbrück Trial  5  American role in the trial  While Sir Geoffrey Lawrence of Britain was the judge chosen as president of the court  the most prominent of the judges at trial arguably was his American counterpart  Francis Biddle  Prior to the trial  Biddle had been Attorney General of the United States but had been asked to resign by Truman earlier in 1945   Some accounts argue that Truman had appointed Biddle as the main American judge for the trial as an apology for asking for his resignation  Ironically  Biddle was known during his time as Attorney General for opposing the idea of prosecuting Nazi leaders for crimes committed before the beginning of the war  even sending out a memorandum on January 5  1945 on the subject  The note also expressed Biddle s opinion that instead of proceeding with the original plan for prosecuting entire organizations  there should simply be more trials that would prosecute specific offenders   Biddle soon changed his mind  as he approved a modified version of the plan on January 21  1945  likely due to time constraints  since the trial would be one of the main issues discussed at Yalta  At trial  the Nuremberg tribunal ruled that any member of an organization convicted of war crimes  such as the SS or Gestapo  who had joined after 1939 would be considered a war criminal  Biddle managed to convince the other judges to make an exemption for any member who was drafted or had no knowledge of the crimes being committed by these organizations   Justice Robert H  Jackson played an important role in not only the trial itself  but also in the creation of the International Military Tribunal  as he led the American delegation to London that  in the summer of 1945  argued in favour of prosecuting the Nazi leadership as a criminal conspiracy  According to Airey Neave  Jackson was also the one behind the prosecution s decision to include membership in any of the six criminal organizations in the indictments at the trial  though the IMT rejected this on the grounds that it was wholly without precedent in either international law or the domestic laws of any of the Allies  Jackson also attempted to have Alfried Krupp be tried in place of his father  Gustav  and even suggested that Alfried volunteer to be tried in his father s place  Both proposals were rejected by the IMT  particularly by Lawrence and Biddle  and some sources indicate that this resulted in Jackson being viewed unfavourably by the latter   Thomas Dodd was a prosecutor for the United States  There was an immense amount of evidence backing the prosecutors  case  especially since meticulous records of the Nazis  actions had been kept  There were records taken in by the prosecutors that had signatures from specific Nazis signing for everything from stationery supplies to Zyklon B gas  which was used to kill the inmates of the deathcamps  Thomas Dodd showed a series of pictures to the courtroom after reading through the documents of crimes committed by the defendants  The showing consisted of pictures displaying the atrocities performed by the defendants  The pictures had been gathered when the inmates were liberated from the concentration camps   6  Legacy  The Tribunal is celebrated for establishing that   c rimes against international law are committed by men  not by abstract entities  and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced   The creation of the IMT was followed by trials of lesser Nazi officials and the trials of Nazi doctors  who performed experiments on people in prison camps  It served as the model for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East which tried Japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity  It also served as the model for the Eichmann trial and for present day courts at The Hague  for trying crimes committed during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s  and at Arusha  for trying the people responsible for the genocide in Rwanda   The Nuremberg trials had a great influence on the development of international criminal law  The Conclusions of the Nuremberg trials served as models for   The Genocide Convention  1948   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights  1948   The Nuremberg Principles  1950   The Convention on the Abolition of the Statute of Limitations on War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity  1968   The Geneva Convention on the Laws and Customs of War  1949  its supplementary protocols  1977  The International Law Commission  acting on the request of the United Nations General Assembly  produced in 1950 the report Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal and in the Judgement of the Tribunal  Yearbook of the International Law Commission  1950  vol  II   See Nuremberg Principles   The influence of the tribunal can also be seen in the proposals for a permanent international criminal court  and the drafting of international criminal codes  later prepared by the International Law Commission   From 2000 on during weekends  tourists can visit courtroom 600 where the trials were held and where a permanent exhibition has been dedicated to the trials   6 1  Establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court  The Nuremberg trials initiated a movement for the prompt establishment of a permanent international criminal court  eventually leading over fifty years later to the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court  This movement was brought about because during the trials  there were conflicting court methods between the German court system and the U S  court system  The crime of conspiracy was unheard of in the civil law systems of the Continent  Therefore  the German defense found it unfair to charge the defendants with conspiracy to commit crimes  while the judges from common law countries were used to doing so    It  IMT  was the first successful international criminal court  and has since played a pivotal role in the development of international criminal law and international institutions”  Fichtelberg 5    7  Criticism  Critics of the Nuremberg trials argued that the charges against the defendants were only defined as  crimes  after they were committed and that therefore the trial was invalid as a form of  victors  justice   As Biddiss observed   the Nuremberg Trial continues to haunt us      It is a question also of the weaknesses and strengths of the proceedings themselves    Quincy Wright  writing eighteen months after the conclusion of the IMT  explained the opposition to the Tribunal thus   Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone called the Nuremberg trials a fraud    Chief U S  prosecutor  Jackson is away conducting his high grade lynching party in Nuremberg   he wrote   I don t mind what he does to the Nazis  but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law  This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old fashioned ideas    Jackson  in a letter discussing the weaknesses of the trial  in October 1945 told U S  President Harry S  Truman that the Allies themselves  have done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans for  The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them  We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practising it  We say aggressive war is a crime and one of our allies asserts sovereignty over the Baltic States based on no title except conquest    Associate Supreme Court Justice William O  Douglas charged that the Allies were guilty of  substituting power for principle  at Nuremberg   I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled   he wrote   Law was created ex post facto to suit the passion and clamor of the time    U S  Deputy Chief Counsel Abraham Pomerantz resigned in protest at the low caliber of the judges assigned to try the industrial war criminals such as those at I G  Farben   Many Germans who agreed with the idea of punishment for war crimes  admitted trepidation concerning the trials  A contemporary German jurist said   The validity of the court has been questioned on a number of grounds   The defendants were not allowed to appeal or affect the selection of judges  A  L  Goodhart  Professor at Oxford  opposed the view that  because the judges were appointed by the victors  the Tribunal was not impartial and could not be regarded as a court in the true sense  He wrote   One of the charges  brought against Keitel  Jodl  and Ribbentrop included conspiracy to commit aggression against Poland in 1939  The Secret Protocols of the German Soviet Non Aggression Pact of 23 August 1939  proposed the partition of Poland between the Germans and the Soviets  which was subsequently executed in September 1939   however  Soviet leaders were not tried for being part of the same conspiracy  Instead  the Tribunal proclaimed the Secret Protocols of the Non Aggression Pact to be a forgery  Moreover  Allied Powers Britain and Soviet Union were not tried for preparing and conducting the Anglo Soviet invasion of Iran and the Winter War  respectively   In 1915  the Allied Powers  Britain  France  and Russia  jointly issued a statement explicitly charging  for the first time  another government  the Sublime Porte  of committing  a crime against humanity   However it was not until the phrase was further developed in the London Charter that it had a specific meaning  As the London Charter definition of what constituted a crime against humanity was unknown when many of the crimes were committed  it could be argued to be a retroactive law  in violation of the principles of prohibition of ex post facto laws and the general principle of penal law nullum crimen  nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali   The court agreed to relieve the Soviet leadership from attending these trials as war criminals in order to hide their crimes against war civilians  war crimes that were committed by their army that included  carving up Poland in 1939 and attacking Finland three months later   This  exclusion request  was initiated by the Soviets and subsequently approved by the court s administration   The trials were conducted under their own rules of evidence  The Charter of the International Military Tribunal permitted the use of normally inadmissible  evidence   Article 19 specified that  The Tribunal shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence     and shall admit any evidence which it deems to have probative value   Article 21 of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal  IMT  Charter stipulated   Though the ICTY later held it to be flawed in principle   the tu quoque argument  adduced by German defendants  was admitted as a valid defense during the trials  and the admirals Dönitz and Raeder were not punished for waging unrestricted submarine warfare   The chief Soviet prosecutor submitted false documentation in an attempt to indict defendants for the murder of thousands of Polish officers in the Katyn forest near Smolensk  However  the other Allied prosecutors refused to support the indictment and German lawyers promised to mount an embarrassing defense  No one was charged or found guilty at Nuremberg for the Katyn Forest massacre  In 1990  the Soviet government acknowledged that the Katyn massacre was carried out  not by the Germans  but by the Soviet secret police   Freda Utley  in her 1949 book  The High Cost of Vengeance  charged the court with amongst other things double standards  She pointed to the Allied use of civilian forced labor  and deliberate starvation of civilians in the occupied territories  She also noted that General Rudenko  the chief Soviet prosecutor  after the trials became commandant of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp   After the fall of East Germany the bodies of 12 500 Soviet era victims were uncovered at the camp  mainly  children  adolescents and elderly people     Luise  the wife of Alfred Jodl  attached herself to her husband s defense team  Subsequently interviewed by Gitta Sereny  researching her biography of Albert Speer  Luise alleged that in many instances the Allied prosecution made charges against Jodl based on documents that they refused to share with the defense  Jodl nevertheless proved some of the charges made against him were untrue  such as the charge that he helped Hitler gain control of Germany in 1933  He was in one instance aided by a GI clerk who chose to give Luise a document showing that the execution of a group of British commandos in Norway had been legitimate  The GI warned Luise that if she didn t copy it immediately she would never see it again   The main Soviet judge  Iona Nikitchenko  presided over some of the most notorious of Joseph Stalin s show trials during the Great Purges of 1936 to 1938  where he among other things sentenced Kamenev and Zinoviev  According to the declassified Soviet archives  681 692 people arrested for  counter revolutionary and state crimes  were shot in 1937 and 1938 alone–an average of over 900 executions a day   The Tribunal itself strongly disputed that the London Charter was ex post facto law  pointing to existing international agreements signed by Germany that made aggressive war and certain wartime actions unlawful  such as the Kellogg Briand Pact  the Covenant of the League of Nations  and the Hague Conventions  In an editorial at the time The Economist  a British weekly newspaper  criticised the hypocrisy of both Britain and France for supporting the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League of Nations over its unprovoked attack against Finland in 1939 and for six years later cooperating with the USSR as a respected equal at Nuremberg  It also criticised the allies for their own double standard at the Nuremberg Trials   nor should the Western world console itself that the Russians alone stand condemned at the bar of the Allies  own justice      Among crimes against humanity stands the offence of the indiscriminate bombing of civilian populations  Can the Americans who dropped the atom bomb and the British who destroyed the cities of western Germany plead  not guilty  on this count  Crimes against humanity also include the mass expulsion of populations  Can the Anglo Saxon leaders who at Potsdam condoned the expulsion of millions of Germans from their homes hold themselves completely innocent      The nations sitting in judgement have so clearly proclaimed themselves exempt from the law which they have administered    7 1  Legitimacy  One criticism that was made of the IMT was that some treaties were not binding on the Axis powers because they were not signatories  This was addressed in the judgment relating to war crimes and crimes against humanity  which contains an expansion of customary law   the Convention Hague 1907 expressly stated that it was an attempt  to revise the general laws and customs of war   which it thus recognised to be then existing  but by 1939 these rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations  and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war which are referred to in Article 6  b  of the  London  Charter    8  Introduction of extempore simultaneous interpretation  The Nuremberg Trials employed four official languages  English  German  French  and Russian  In order to address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings  interpretation and translation departments had to be established  However  it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly  What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals and history of the interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique  extempore simultaneous interpretation  This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source  or passive  language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time  that is  simultaneously  through headsets and microphones  Interpreters were split into four sections  one for each official language  with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth  their mother tongue   For instance  the English booth consisted of three interpreters  one working from German into English  one working from French  and one from Russian  etc  Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters  Some of the languages heard over the course of the proceedings included Yiddish  Hungarian  Czech  Ukrainian  and Polish   The equipment used to establish this system was provided by IBM  and included an elaborate setup of cables which were hooked up to headsets and single earphones directly from the four interpreting booths  often referred to as  the aquarium    Four channels existed for each working language  as well as a root channel for the proceedings without interpretation  Switching of channels was controlled by a setup at each table in which the listener merely had to turn a dial in order to switch between languages  People tripping over the floor laid cables often led to the headsets getting disconnected  with several hours at a time sometimes being taken in order to repair the problem and continue on with the trials   Interpreters were recruited and examined by the respective countries in which the official languages were spoken  US  UK  France  the Soviet Union  Germany  Switzerland  and Austria  as well as in special cases Belgium and the Netherlands  Many were former translators  army personnel  and linguists  some were experienced consecutive interpreters  others were ordinary individuals and even recent secondary school graduates who led international lives in multilingual environments  It was  and still is believed  that the qualities that made the best interpreters were not just a perfect understanding of two or more languages  but more importantly a broad sense of culture  encyclopædic knowledge  inquisitiveness  as well as a naturally calm disposition   With the simultaneous technique being extremely new  interpreters practically trained themselves  but many could not handle the pressure or the psychological strain  Many often had to be replaced  many returned to the translation department  and many left  Serious doubts were given as to whether interpretation provided a fair trial for the defendants  particularly because of fears of mistranslation and errors made on transcripts  The translation department had to also deal with the overwhelming problem of being understaffed and overburdened with an influx of documents that could not be kept up with  More often than not  interpreters were stuck in a session without having proper documents in front of them and were relied upon to do sight translation or double translation of texts  causing further problems and extensive criticism  Other problems that arose included complaints from lawyers and other legal professionals with regard to questioning and cross examination  Legal professionals were most often appalled at the slower speed at which they had to conduct their task because of the extended time required for interpreters to do an interpretation properly  Also  a number of interpreters were noted for protesting the idea of using vulgar language reflected in the proceeds  especially if it referenced Jews or the conditions of the Nazi concentration camps  Bilingual trilingual members who attended the trials picked up quickly on this aspect of character and were equally quick to file complaints   Yet  despite the extensive trial and error  without the interpretation system the trials would not have been possible and in turn revolutionized the way multilingual issues were addressed in tribunals and conferences  A number of the interpreters following the trials were immediately recruited into the newly formed United Nations  while others returned to their ordinary lives  pursued other careers  or worked freelance  Outside the boundaries of the trials  many interpreters continued their positions on weekends interpreting for dinners  private meetings between judges  and excursions between delegates  Others worked as investigators or editors  or aided the translation department when they could  often using it as an opportunity to sharpen their skills and to correct poor interpretations on transcripts before they were available for public record   For further reference  a book titled The Origins of Simultaneous Interpretation  The Nuremberg Trial  written by interpreter Francesca Gaiba  was published by the University of Ottawa Press in 1998   Today  all major international organizations  as well as any conference or government that uses more than one official language  uses extempore simultaneous interpretation  Notable bodies include the Parliament of Kosovo with three official languages  the Parliament of Canada with two official languages  the Parliament of South Africa with eleven official languages  the European Union with twenty four official languages  and the United Nations with six official working languages   9  See also  Nuremberg Trials bibliography  Command responsibility  Dora Trial  Eichmann in Jerusalem  Einsatzgruppen Trial  International Military
