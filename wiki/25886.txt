In Norse mythology  Rán  Old Norse  sea  or  robber   is a sea goddess  According to Snorri Sturluson s Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál  in his retelling of the Poetic Edda poem Lokasenna  she is married to Ægir and they have nine daughters together  Snorri also reports that she had a net in which she tried to capture men who ventured out on the sea   Ran is the name of Ægir s wife  and their daughters are nine  even as we have written before  At this feast all things were self served  both food and ale  and all implements needful to the feast  Then the Æsir became aware that Rán had that net wherein she was wont to catch all men who go upon the sea  Her net is also mentioned in Reginsmál and in the Völsunga saga  where she lends it to Loki so that he can capture Andvari  She is also associated with the practice of sailors bringing gold with them on any voyage  so that if they drowned while at sea  Ran would be pleased by their gift   1  Attestations  1 1  Poetic Edda  Her willingness to capture sailing men is referred to in this citation from the Eddic poem Helgakviða Hundingsbana I where escaping the perils of the sea is referred to as escaping Rán   Whether men drowned by her doing or not  she appears to have received those drowned at sea  as exemplified in the section called Hrímgerðarmál in the Eddic poem Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar  where the giantess Hrímgerðr is accused of having wanted to give the king s warriors to Rán  i e  to drown them   1 2  Prose Edda  In addition  Snorri says in Skáldskaparmál that  Rán s husband   verr Ránar  and  land of Rán   land Ránar  are kennings for the sea  Furthermore  her close association with the sea permitted the kenning for gold  brightness of the sea  to be rendered as  brightness of Rán   gull er kallat eldr eða ljós eða birti Ægis  Ránar eða   Not surprisingly  the sea was also referred to as  Rán s road   Ránar vegr   as in the following stanza by the skald Njáll Þorgeirsson quoted by Snorri   Rán was a dangerous goddess and Snorri adds a stanza of poetry by the skald Refr where the voracious sea is called  Ægir s wide mouth  and  Rán s mouth    In this poem  Gymir s wet cold Spae Wife  völva   is likely a reference to Rán  as Snorri and the skald present Gymir as another name for Ægir   1 3  Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna  In the legendary saga Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna  Friðþjófr and his men find themselves in a violent storm  and the protagonist mourns that he will soon rest in Rán s bed   The protagonist then decides that as they are to  go to Rán   at til Ránar skal fara  they would better do so in style with gold on each man  He divides the gold and talks of her again   2  Notes  3  References  Simek  Rudolf  2007  translated by Angela Hall  Dictionary of Northern Mythology  D S  Brewer  ISBN 0 85991 513 1
