A mondegreen is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase as a result of near homophony  in a way that gives it a new meaning   Mondegreens are most often created by a person listening to a poem or a song  the listener  being unable to clearly hear a lyric  substitutes words that sound similar  and make some kind of sense  American writer Sylvia Wright coined the term in her essay  The Death of Lady Mondegreen   published in Harper s Magazine in November 1954  The term was inspired by     and Lady Mondegreen   a misinterpretation of the line  and laid him on the green   from the Scottish ballad  The Bonnie Earl o Moray    Mondegreen  was included in the 2000 edition of the Random House Webster s College Dictionary  Merriam Webster s Collegiate Dictionary added the word in 2008  The phenomenon is not limited to English  with examples cited by Fyodor Dostoyevsky  in the Hebrew song  Háva Nagíla    Let s Be Happy    and in Bollywood movies   A closely related category is a Hobson Jobson  where a word from a foreign language is homophonically translated into one s own language  e g  cockroach from Spanish cucaracha  For misheard lyrics this phenomenon is called soramimi   An unintentionally incorrect use of similar sounding words or phrases in speaking is a malapropism  If there is a connection in meaning  it can be called an eggcorn  If a person stubbornly sticks to a mispronunciation after being corrected  that person has committed a mumpsimus   1  Etymology  In the essay  Wright described how  as a young girl  she misheard the last line of the first stanza from the 17th century ballad  The Bonnie Earl o  Moray   She wrote  The actual fourth line is  And laid him on the green   Wright explained the need for a new term   Her essay had already described the bonny Earl holding the beautiful Lady Mondegreen s hand  both bleeding profusely but faithful unto the death  She disputed  Other examples Wright suggested are   Surely Good Mrs  Murphy shall follow me all the days of my life   Surely goodness and mercy…  from Psalm 23   The wild  strange battle cry  Haffely  Gaffely  Gaffely  Gonward     Half a league  half a league    Half a league onward   from  The Charge of the Light Brigade    2  Psychology  Human beings interpret their environment partially based on experience  and this includes speech perception  People are more likely to notice what they expect than things not part of their everyday experiences  and may mistake an unfamiliar stimulus for a familiar and more plausible version  For example  to consider a common mondegreen in the song  Purple Haze   one would be more likely to hear somebody recalling they kissed this guy than saying that they were about to kiss the sky  Similarly  if a lyric uses words that the listener is unfamiliar with  they may be misheard as using more familiar terms   The creation of mondegreens may be driven in part by a phenomenon akin to cognitive dissonance  as the listener may find it psychologically uncomfortable to listen to a song and not be able to make out the words  particularly if the listener is fluent in the language of the lyrics  Steven Connor suggests that mondegreens are the result of the brain s constant attempts to make sense of the world by making assumptions to fill in the gaps when it cannot clearly determine what it is hearing  Connor sees mondegreens as the  wrenchings of nonsense into sense    On the other hand  Steven Pinker has observed that mondegreen mishearings tend to be less plausible than the original lyrics  and that once a listener has  locked in  to a particular misheard interpretation of a song s lyrics  it can remain unquestioned  even when that plausibility becomes strained  for more on this sort of stubbornness  see Mumpsimus   Pinker gives the example of a student  stubbornly  mishearing the chorus to  I m Your Venus  as I m your penis  and being surprised that the song was allowed on the radio   James Gleick claims that the mondegreen is a distinctly modern phenomenon  Although people have no doubt misconstrued song lyrics for as long as songs have been sung  without improved communication and the language standardization that accompanies it  he believes there would have been no way to recognize and discuss this shared experience  Since time immemorial  songs have been passed on by word of mouth  Just as mondegreens transform songs based on experience  a folk song learned by repetition of heard lyrics is often transformed over time when sung by people in a country where some of the song s references have become obscure  A classic example is  The Golden Vanity   which contains the line  As she sailed upon the lowland sea   The song was carried to Appalachia by immigrants from England  where singers  not knowing what the lowland sea refers to  transformed it over generations from  lowland  to  lonesome    3  Examples  3 1  In songs  The top three mondegreens submitted regularly to mondegreen expert Jon Carroll are   Gladly  the cross eyed bear  from the line in the hymn  Keep Thou My Way  by Fanny Crosby and Theodore E  Perkins   Kept by Thy tender care  gladly the cross I ll bear   Carroll and many others quote it as  Gladly the cross I d bear    There s a bathroom on the right  the line at the end of each verse of  Bad Moon Rising  by Creedence Clearwater Revival   There s a bad moon on the rise    ′Scuse me while I kiss this guy  from a lyric in the song  Purple Haze  by The Jimi Hendrix Experience    Scuse me while I kiss the sky    Both Creedence s John Fogerty and Hendrix eventually acknowledged these mishearings by deliberately singing the  mondegreen  versions of their songs in concert   Likewise  on the video for the 2000 Zoom concert with a re formed Electric Light Orchestra  Jeff Lynne on the song  Showdown  sings  It s a real submarine    a common mishearing of his original lyrics  It s unreal suffering    The 1963 song  Louie Louie  by The Kingsmen  actually a sea shanty  was so difficult to understand  because of how poorly the Kingsmen s version of it was recorded  that many people suspected the song contained obscene lyrics  The FBI was asked to investigate whether or not those involved with the song violated laws against the interstate transportation of obscene material  The most notable misinterpretation of the lyrics presented by the parent who sent the complaint can be found in the verse  Me see Jamaica moon above    It won t be long me see me love    Me take her in my arms and then   I tell her I never leave again   which was misheard as  She had a rag on  she moved above    It won t be long  she ll slip it off    I held her in my arms and then    and I told her I d rather lay her again   No lyrics were ever officially published for the song  and after two years of investigation  the FBI concluded that the lyrics were unintelligible   Rap and hip hop lyrics may be particularly susceptible to being misheard because they do not necessarily follow standard American pronunciations  The delivery of rap lyrics relies heavily upon an often regional pronunciation or non traditional accenting of words and their phonemes to adhere to the artist s stylizations and the lyrics s written structure  This issue is exemplified in controversies over alleged transcription errors in Yale University Press s 2010 Anthology of Rap    Blinded by the Light   a cover of a Bruce Springsteen song by Manfred Mann s Earth Band  contains what has been called  probably the most misheard lyric of all time   The phrase  revved up like a deuce   altered from Springsteen s original  cut loose like a deuce   both lyrics referring to the hot rodders slang for a 1932 Ford coupé  is frequently misheard as  wrapped up like a douche   Springsteen himself has joked about the phenomenon  claiming that it was not until Manfred Mann rewrote the song to be about a  feminine hygiene product  that the song became popular   Sometimes  the modified version of a lyric becomes standard  as is the case with  The Twelve Days of Christmas   The original has  four colly birds   colly means black   sometime around the turn of the twentieth century  these became calling birds  which is the lyric used in the 1909 Frederic Austin version   A number of misheard lyrics have been recorded  turning a mondegreen into a real title  They include   The title of the animated Christmas show Olive  the Other Reindeer is a mondegreen on  all of the other reindeer   a line from the classic Christmas song  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer    The song  Sea Lion Woman   recorded in 1939 by Christine and Katherine Shipp  was performed by Nina Simone under the title  See Line Woman  and later by Feist as  Sealion   According to the liner notes from the compilation A Treasury of Library of Congress Field Recordings  the actual title of this playground song might also be  See  the  Lyin  Woman  or  C Line Woman    Jack Lawrence s misinterpretation of the French phrase  pauvre Jean    poor John   as the identically pronounced  pauvres gens    poor people   led to the translation of La goualante du pauvre Jean   The Ballad of Poor John   as  The Poor People of Paris   which in no way hindered it from becoming a major hit in 1956   3 1 1  Non English language  Ghil ad Zuckermann cites the Hebrew example mukhrakhím liyót saméakh   we must be happy   with a grammar mistake  instead of  the high register  úru  akhím belév saméakh   wake up  brothers  with a happy heart    from the well known song  Háva Nagíla   Let’s be happy    The Israeli site dedicated to Hebrew mondegreens has coined the term  avatiach   Hebrew for watermelon  for  mondegreen   named for a common mishearing of Shlomo Artzi s award winning 1970 song  Ahavtia    I loved her   using a form uncommon in spoken Hebrew    The title of the 1983 French novel Le Thé au harem d Archi Ahmed   Tea in the Harem of Archi Ahmed   by Mehdi Charef  and the 1985 movie of the same name  is based on the main character mishearing le théorème de Archimède   the theorem of Archimedes   in his mathematics class   The title of the film La Vie en rose depicting the life of Edith Piaf can be mistaken for  L Avion rose   The pink airplane    A classic example in French is similar to the  Lady Mondegreen  anecdote  In his 1962 collection of children s quotes La foire au cancres  the humorist Jean Charles refers to a misunderstood lyric of  La Marseillaise   the French national anthem    Entendez vous     mugir ces féroces soldats   Do you hear those savage soldiers roar   is heard as     Séféro  ce soldat   that soldier Séféro    The French word  lapalissade   designating a gross truism or platitude  is derived from the name of Jacques II de Chabannes  Seigneur de La Palice  because of a mondegreen in a mourning song written just after his heroic death  and not  as is sometimes believed  because Jacques de La Palice was prone to uttering truisms   The mourning song reads   which means   Because of the long  s   ſ  looking like an  f   it was misread thus   which means   This truism remains as the first and most well known  lapalissade  in French   3 2  In literature  The title of J  D  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye is often mistaken for a mondegreen  The main character  Holden Caulfield  misremembers a sung version of the Robert Burns poem  Coming Through the Rye   the line  Gin a body meet a body   comin  through the rye  is recalled as  Gin a body catch a body   comin  through the rye   However  since this is only a result of Holden s poor memory  and not possibly a result of him mishearing  meet  as  catch   it cannot be considered a proper mondegreen   A Monk Swimming by author Malachy McCourt is so titled because of a childhood mishearing of a phrase from the Catholic rosary prayer  Hail Mary   Amongst women  became  a monk swimmin     The title and plot of the short sci fi story  Come You Nigh  Kay Shuns    Com mu ni ca tions   by Lawrence A  Perkins  in Analog Science Fiction and Fact magazine  April 1970   deals with securing interplanetary radio communications by encoding them with mondegreens   3 3  In film  A monologue of mondegreens appears in the 1971 film Carnal Knowledge  The camera focuses on actress Candice Bergen laughing as she recounts various phrases that fooled her as a child  including  Round John Virgin   instead of   Round yon virgin      and the famous  Gladly  the cross eyed bear    In the movie The Long Kiss Goodnight  one character is singing along to the song I d Really Love to See You Tonight and misquotes one line as  I m not talking  bout the linen   before being corrected by another character that the words actually are  I m not talking about moving in    3 4  In television  Mondegreens have been used as a story element in advertising campaigns  including   A commercial for the 2012 Volkswagen Passat touting the car s audio system shows a number of people singing incorrect versions of the line  Burning out his fuse up here alone  from the Elton John Bernie Taupin song  Rocket Man   until a woman listening to the song in a Passat realizes the correct words   A series of advertisements for Maxell audio cassette tapes  produced by Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury  shown in 1989 and 1990  featured misheard versions of  Israelites   e g    Me ears are alight   by Desmond Dekker and  Into the Valley  by The Skids as heard by users of other brands of tape   A commercial for Coca Cola with Lime  in which a technician in the Coca Cola laboratory rushes to his boss  saying   Put the lime in the Coke  you nut   to the tune of Harry Nilsson s  Coconut    A 1987 series of commercials for Kellogg s Nut  n Honey Crunch was based on a joke in which one person asks  What s for breakfast   and is told  Nut  N  Honey   which is misheard as  Nothing  honey   The ad faced protests as promoting antigay sentiment as humorous  Ultimately  the cereal itself had to be renamed  Honey Crunch Corn Flakes     Mondegreens  is the name of a segment on the Australian music quiz show Spicks and Specks  ABC TV    The Two Ronnies comedy sketch  Four Candles  is entirely built around mondegreens  including a taciturn customer s request for  fork handles  being misheard as  four candles   The comic effect is enhanced by the strong regional accents affected by the actors   Mondegreens are a big feature of the Nickelodeon TV series Rugrats  where Chuckie  Tommy and Angelica and other babies misinterpret many big words as something else  For instance  ATM machine is heard as M&M machine  resulting in thinking that money bags in the vault have  prizes  inside   they hear the word championship at the bowling alley and think it is  champion chip  assuming it has a chocolate chip  then they lick a trophy and say   Eew  this isn t a chocolate chip    3 5  Other examples  Among schoolchildren in the U S   daily rote recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance has long provided opportunities for the genesis of mondegreens   Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky in 1875 cited a line from Fyodor Glinka s song  Troika   1825  колокольчик  дар Валдая   the bell  gift of Valday   claiming that it is usually understood as колокольчик  дарвалдая   the bell darvaldaying —the onomatopoetic verb for ringing    The Turkish political party  the Democratic Party  changed its logo in 2007 to one of a white horse in front of a red background because rural voters often could not pronounce its Turkish name  Demokrat   instead saying demir kırat   iron white horse     4  Reverse mondegreen  Some nonsensical lyrics can be interpreted homophonically as rational text  A prominent example is Mairzy Doats  a 1943 novelty song by Milton Drake  Al Hoffman  and Jerry Livingston  The lyrics are a mondegreen and it is up to the listener to figure out what they mean   The refrain of the song repeats nonsensical sounding lines   The clue to the meaning is contained in the bridge   The listener can figure out that the last line of the refrain is  A kid ll eat ivy  too  wouldn t you    but this line is sung only as a mondegreen   Other examples include   Iron Butterfly s 1968 hit  In A Gadda Da Vida   a reverse mondegreen of the phrase  In the Garden of Eden   which was going to be the song s title  according to liner notes   An episode of The Simpsons called  Bart Sells His Soul  has Bart Simpson handing out the song s lyrics as a hymn titled  In the Garden of Eden  by I  Ron Butterfly    Sly and the Family Stone s 1970 hit  Thank You  Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin   is pronounced  Thank You For Lettin  Me Be Myself Again    A plot line in the 1945 comedy mystery film Murder  He Says  which involves a nonsense ditty repeated by a character  which is a reverse mondegreen that contains a clue to finding some lost money   Anguish Languish  English language  by Howard L  Chace contains stories and poems that are deliberate mondegreens using real English words in a nonsensical order  It includes the widely known story  Ladle Rat Rotten Hut   Little Red Riding Hood    5  Deliberate mondegreen  Two authors have written books of supposed foreign language poetry that are actually mondegreens of nursery rhymes in English  Luis van Rooten s pseudo French Mots D Heures  Gousses  Rames includes critical  historical and interpretive apparatus  as does John Hulme s Mörder Guss Reims  attributed to a fictitious German poet  Both titles sound like the phrase  Mother Goose Rhymes   Both works can also be considered soramimi  which produces different meanings when interpreted in another language  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart produced a similar effect in his canon  Difficile Lectu   written c  1786 87  when he was 30 or 31   which  though ostensibly in Latin  is actually an opportunity for scatological humor in both German and Italian   Some performers and writers have used deliberate mondegreens to create double entendres  The lyric  if you see Kay   F U C K  has been employed many times  including by blues pianist Memphis Slim in 1963  R  Stevie Moore in 1977  April Wine on its 1982 album Power Play  the Poster Children via their  Junior Citizen  in 1995  and Turbonegro in 2005  as well as a line from James Joyce s 1922 novel Ulysses  Britney Spears did the same thing with the song  If U Seek Amy   as did The Script in their 2008 song  If You See Kay  and Aerosmith in  Devil s Got a New Disguise   A similar effect was created in Hindi in the 2011 Bollywood movie Delhi Belly in the song  Bhaag D K  Bose   While  D  K  Bose  appears to be a person s name  it is sung repeatedly in the chorus to form the deliberate mondegreen  bhosadi ke   Hindi  भोसडी के   a Hindi expletive  The 1992 song Ebeneezer Goode by The Shamen repeated the lyric  Es are good  Es are good  He s Ebeneezer Goode  to make an overt reference to use of the drug ecstasy    Mondegreen  is a song by Yeasayer on their 2010 album Odd Blood  The lyrics are intentionally obscure  for instance   Everybody sugar in my bed  and  Perhaps the pollen in the air turns us into a stapler   and spoken hastily to encourage the mondegreen effect   The Klaatu song  Silly Boys  from the album Sir Army Suit uses the vocal track from a song on an earlier album  Anus of Uranus  run backwards with a new  correctly recorded instrumental backing track  The lyrics printed on the lyric sheet were written to portray a literal interpretation of the lyrics  as they would normally be heard  without the assistance of back masking  resulting in slightly nonsensical phrases  including the title of the album  and could all be considered mondegreens  The lyrics were also printed backwards on the lyric sheet   6  See also  Ambiguity  Amphibology  Earworm
