Lucifer      is the King James Version rendering of the Hebrew word in Isaiah   This word  transliterated hêlêl or heylel  occurs only once in the Hebrew Bible and according to the KJV influenced Strong s Concordance means  shining one  morning star   The word Lucifer is taken from the Latin Vulgate  which translates הֵילֵל as lucifer  meaning  the morning star  the planet Venus   or  as an adjective   light bringing   The Septuagint renders הֵילֵל in Greek as ἑωσφόρος  heōsphoros   a name  literally  bringer of dawn   for the morning star   Later Christian tradition came to use the Latin word for  morning star   lucifer  as a proper name   Lucifer   for the Devil  as he was before his fall  As a result    Lucifer  has become a by word for Satan the Devil in the Church and in popular literature   as in Dante Alighieri s Inferno and John Milton s Paradise Lost  However  the Latin word never came to be used almost exclusively  as in English  in this way  and was applied to others also  including Christ  The image of a morning star fallen from the sky  is generally believed amongst scholars to have a parallel in Canaanite mythology   However  according to both Christian and Jewish exegesis  in the Book of Isaiah  chapter 14  the King of Babylon  Nebuchadnezzar II  conqueror of Jerusalem  is condemned in a prophetic vision by the prophet Isaiah and is called the  Morning Star   planet Venus   In this chapter the Hebrew text says    Helel ben Shaḥar  may refer to the Morning Star  but the text in Isaiah 14 gives no indication that Helel was a star or planet   1  Etymology  Lucifer or morning star  Translation of הֵילֵל as  Lucifer   as in the King James Version  has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14 12  Present day translations have  morning star   New International Version  New Century Version  New American Standard Bible  Good News Translation  Holman Christian Standard Bible  Contemporary English Version  Common English Bible  Complete Jewish Bible    daystar   New Jerusalem Bible  English Standard Version  The Message   Day Star  New Revised Standard Version    shining one   New Life Version  New World Translation  JPS Tanakh  or  shining star   New Living Translation    The term appears in the context of an oracle against a dead king of Babylon  who is addressed as הילל בן שחר  hêlêl ben šāḥar   rendered by the King James Version as  O Lucifer  son of the morning   and by others as  morning star  son of the dawn    In a modern translation from the original Hebrew  the passage in which the phrase  Lucifer  or  morning star  occurs begins with the statement   On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you  you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon  How the oppressor has come to an end  How his fury has ended   After describing the death of the king  the taunt continues   J  Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted  the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man   For the unnamed  king of Babylon  a wide range of identifications have been proposed  They include a Babylonian ruler of the prophet Isaiah s own time the later Nebuchadnezzar II  under whom the Babylonian captivity of the Jews began  or Nabonidus  and the Assyrian kings Tiglath Pileser  Sargon II and Sennacherib  Herbert Wolf held that the  king of Babylon  was not a specific ruler but a generic representation of the whole line of rulers   2  Isaiah 14 12  2 1  Mythology behind Isaiah 14 12  In ancient Canaanite mythology  the morning star is pictured as a god  Attar  who attempted to occupy the throne of Ba al and  finding he was unable to do so  descended and ruled the underworld  The original myth may have been about a lesser god Helel trying to dethrone the Canaanite high god El who lived on a mountain to the north  Hermann Gunkel s reconstruction of the myth told of a mighty warrior called Hêlal  whose ambition it was to ascend higher than all the other stellar divinities  but who had to descend to the depths  it thus portrayed as a battle the process by which the bright morning star fails to reach the highest point in the sky before being faded out by the rising sun   Similarities have been noted with the East Semitic story of Ishtar s or Inanna s descent into the underworld  Ishtar and Inanna being associated with the planet Venus  A connection has been seen also with the Babylonian myth of Etana  The Jewish Encyclopedia comments   The Greek myth of Phaethon  whose name  like that of הֵילֵל  means  Shining One   has also been seen as similar   The Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible points out that no evidence has been found of any Canaanite myth of a god being thrown from heaven  as in Isaiah 14 12  It concludes that the closest parallels with Isaiah s description of the king of Babylon as a fallen morning star cast down from heaven are to be found not in any lost Canaanite and other myths but in traditional ideas of the Jewish people themselves  echoed in the Biblical account of the fall of Adam and Eve  cast out of God s presence for wishing to be as God  and the picture in of the  gods  and  sons of the Most High  destined to die and fall  This Jewish tradition has echoes also in Jewish pseudepigrapha such as 2 Enoch and the Life of Adam and Eve   3  Latin word lucifer  As an adjective  the Latin word lucifer meant  light bringing  and was applied to the moon  As a noun  it meant  morning star   or  in Roman mythology  its divine personification as  the fabled son of Aurora and Cephalus  and father of Ceyx   or  in poetry   day   The second of the meanings attached to the word when used as a noun corresponds to the image in Greek mythology of Eos  the goddess of dawn  giving birth to the morning star Phosphorus   is not the only place where the Vulgate uses the word lucifer  It uses the same word four more times  in contexts where it clearly has no reference to a fallen angel   meaning  morning star      the light of the morning      the signs of the zodiac   and   the dawn    To speak of the morning star  lucifer is not the only expression that the Vulgate uses  three times it uses stella matutina   referring to the actual morning star   and  of uncertain reference  and  referring to Jesus    Indications that in Christian tradition the Latin word Lucifer  unlike the English word  did not necessarily call a fallen angel to mind exist also outside the text of the Vulgate  Two bishops bore that name  Saint Lucifer of Cagliari  and Lucifer of Siena   In Latin  the word is applied to John the Baptist and is used as a title of Christ himself in several early Christian hymns  The morning hymn Lucis largitor splendide of Hilary contains the line   Tu verus mundi lucifer   Some interpreted the mention of the morning star  lucifer  in Ambrose s hymn Aeterne rerum conditor as referring allegorically to Christ and the mention of the cock  the herald of the day  praeco  in the same hymn as referring to John the Baptist  Likewise  in the medieval hymn Christe qui lux es et dies  some manuscripts have the line  Lucifer lucem proferens    The Latin word lucifer is also used of Christ in the Easter Proclamation prayer to God regarding the paschal candle  Flammas eius lucifer matutinus inveniat  ille  inquam  lucifer  qui nescit occasum  Christus Filius tuus  qui  regressus ab inferis  humano generi serenus illuxit  et vivit et regnat in saecula saeculorum  May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star  the one Morning Star who never sets  Christ your Son  who  coming back from death s domain  has shed his peaceful light on humanity  and lives and reigns for ever and ever   In the works of Latin grammarians  Lucifer  like Daniel  was discussed as an example of a personal name   4  Literal meaning  The Hebrew words in Isaiah 14 12 are part of a prophetic vision against an oppressive king of Babylon  Jewish exegesis of Isaiah 14 12–15 took a humanistic approach by identifying the king of Babylon as Nebuchadnezzar II  Verse 20 says that this king of Babylon will not be  joined with them  all the kings of the nations  in burial  because thou hast destroyed thy land  thou hast slain thy people  the seed of evil doers shall not be named for ever   but rather be cast out of the grave  while  All the kings of the nations  all of them  sleep in glory  every one in his own house    5  Intertestamental Period  In the Second temple period literature the main possible reference is found in 2 Enoch  also known as Slavonic Enoch   However the editor of the standard modern edition  Charlesworth OTP Vol 1  pipelines the verse as a probable later Christian interpolation on the grounds that  Christian explanations of the origin of evil linked Lk 10 18 with Isa 14 and eventually Gen 3 so vs 4 could be a Christian interpolation    Jewish theology concentrated on Gen 6   and this is prominent in the Enoch cycle as in other apocalypses   Further the name used in 2 Enoch  Satanail  is not directly related to the Isaiah 14 text and the surrounding imagery of fire and stones suggests Ezekiel 28   Other instances of  Lucifer  in the Old Testament Pseudepigrapha are related simply to the  star  Venus  in the Sibylline Oracles battle of the constellations  line 517   Lucifer fought mounted on the back of Leo   or the entirely rewritten Christian version of the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra 4 32 which has a reference to Lucifer as Antichrist   An association of Isaiah 14 12 18 with a personification of the evil  called the Devil developed outside of mainstream  rabbinic  Judaism in Pseudepigrapha and Christian writings  Old Testament Pseudepigrapha are works produced after the closing of the Hebrew Bible canon  they flourished toward the end of the Second Temple period under Roman occupation  particularly with the apocalypses  Old Testament Pseudepigrapha are not accepted as part of Jewish tradition  but are in custodianship of the church  This period before the closing of the Christian canon is also called the Intertestamental Period when the deuterocanonical books were written   Especially Isaiah 14 12  became a dominant conception of a fallen angel motif in Enoch literature  Rabbis  in Medieval Judaism  made every attempt to protect the Jewish community from their currency  strictly rejecting these Enochic phantasms  Rabbinical Judaism rejected any belief in rebel or fallen angels  having a view that evil is abstract  In the 11th century  the Pirqe de Rabbi Eliezer  an aggadic midrashic work on the Torah containing exegesis and retellings of biblical stories  illustrates the origin of the  fallen angel myth  by giving two accounts  one relates to the angel in the garden in Eden  who seduces Eve  and the other relates to the angels  the benei elohim  who cohabit with the daughters of man  Genesis 6 1 4    6  Allegorical interpretation in Christianity  Apart from the literal meaning of Isaiah 14 12  which applies to a king of Babylon  Christian writers applied the words allegorically to Satan  Sigve K Tonstad argues that in the New Testament itself the War in Heaven theme of   in which the dragon  who is called the devil and Satan … was thrown down to the earth   derives from the passage in Isaiah 14  Origen  184 185 – 253 254  interpreted such Old Testament passages as being about manifestations of the Devil  but of course  writing in Greek  not Latin  he did not identify the Devil with the name  Lucifer   Tertullian  c  160 – c  225   who wrote in Latin  also understood   I will ascend above the tops of the clouds  I will make myself like the Most High   as spoken by the Devil  but  Lucifer  is not among the numerous names and phrases he used to describe the Devil  Even at the time of the Latin writer Augustine of Hippo  354 – 430    Lucifer  had not yet become a common name for the Devil   Some time later  the metaphor of the morning star that Isaiah 14 12 applied to a king of Babylon gave rise to the general use of the Latin word for  morning star   capitalized  as the original name of the Devil before his fall from grace  linking Isaiah 14 12 with   I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven   and interpreting the passage in Isaiah as an allegory of Satan s fall from heaven   However  the understanding of the morning star in Isaiah 14 12 as a metaphor referring to a king of Babylon continued also to exist among Christians  Theodoret of Cyrus  c  393 – c  457  wrote that Isaiah calls the king  morning star   not as being the star  but as having had the illusion of being it  The same understanding is shown in Christian translations of the passage  which in English generally use  morning star  rather than treating the word as a proper name   Lucifer   So too in other languages  such as French  German  Portuguese  and Spanish  Even the Vulgate text in Latin is printed with lower case lucifer  morning star   not upper case Lucifer  proper name    Calvin said   The exposition of this passage  which some have given  as if it referred to Satan  has arisen from ignorance  for the context plainly shows these statements must be understood in reference to the king of the Babylonians   Luther also considered it a gross error to refer this verse to the devil   6 1  Christians who identify Lucifer with Satan or the Devil  Adherents of the King James Only movement and others who hold that Isaiah 14 12 does indeed refer to the devil have decried the modern translations   Treating  Lucifer  as a name for the devil or Satan  they may use that name when speaking of such accounts of the devil or Satan as the following    Satan inciting David to number Israel  1 Chronicles     Job tested by Satan  Book of Job    Satan ready to accuse the high priest Joshua  Zechariah     Sin brought into the world through the devil s envy  Wisdom      The prince of the power of the air  the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience   Ephesians      The god of this world   2 Corinthians      The devil disputing with Michael about the body of Moses  Jude     The dragon of the Book of Revelation  who is called the devil and Satan      They may also use the name Lucifer when speaking of Satan s motive for rebelling and of the nature of his sin  which Origen  Chrysostom  Jerome  Ambrose  and Augustine attributed to the devil s pride  and Irenaeus  Tertullian  Justin Martyr  Cyprian  and again Augustine attributed to the devil s envy of humanity created in the image of God  Jealousy of humans  created in the divine image and given authority over the world is the motive that a modern writer  who denies that there is any such person as Lucifer  says that Tertullian attributed to the Devil  and  while he cited Tertullian and Augustine as giving envy as the motive for the fall  an 18th century French Capuchin preacher himself described the Rebel Angel as jealous of Adam s exaltation  which he saw as a diminution of his own status   7  Islam  In Islam the Devil is known as    plural    or    plural     He has no name corresponding in meaning to that of the Latin word lucifer to associate him with the Morning Star  but the accounts of him resemble the fallen angel accounts in Enochic and Christian literature  Iblis is banished from heaven for refusing to prostrate himself before Adam  Thus  he sins after the creation of man  He asks God for a respite until the Last Day rather than being consigned to the Fire of Hell immediately  God grants this request  and Iblis then swears revenge by tempting human beings and turning them away from God  God tells him that any humans who follow him will join him in the Fire of Hell at Judgement  but that Iblis will have no power over all mankind except who wants to follow Iblis  This story is cited multiple times in the Qur an for different reasons   Islamic literature presents divergent ideas of the nature of Iblis  In one view Iblis is a prominent angel turned devil through disobedience  Apart from the idea that Iblis is an angel  there is the commonly held view that Iblis is a jinn  as well as the view that Iblis is neither angel or jinn but uniquely created out of fire  the view that the nature is ambiguous  and the view that Iblis is an angel transformed into a jinn for disobedience   8  Occultism  Luciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer  The tradition  influenced by Gnosticism  usually reveres Lucifer not as the Devil  but as a liberator or guiding spirit or even the true god as opposed to Jehovah   In Anton LaVey s The Satanic Bible  Lucifer is one of the Four Crown Princes of Hell  particularly that of the East  Lord of the Air  and is called  Bringer of Light  the Morning Star  Intellectualism  Enlightenment    Author Michael W  Ford has written on Lucifer as a  mask  of the Adversary  a motivator and illuminating force of the mind and subconscious   9  Taxil s hoax  Léo Taxil  1854–1907  claimed that Freemasonry is associated with worshipping Lucifer  In what is known as the Taxil hoax  he alleged that leading Freemason Albert Pike had addressed  The 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world   an invention of Taxil   instructing them that Lucifer was God  and was in opposition to the evil god Adonai  Supporters of Freemasonry contend that  when Albert Pike and other Masonic scholars spoke about the  Luciferian path   or the  energies of Lucifer   they were referring to the Morning Star  the light bearer  the search for light  the very antithesis of dark  satanic evil  Taxil promoted a book by Diana Vaughan  actually written by himself  as he later confessed publicly  that purported to reveal a highly secret ruling body called the Palladium  which controlled the organization and had a satanic agenda  As described by Freemasonry Disclosed in 1897   Taxil s work and Pike s address continue to be quoted by anti masonic groups   In Devil Worship in France  Arthur Edward Waite compared Taxil s work to what today we would call a tabloid story  replete with logical and factual inconsistencies   10  Gallery  File Inf  34 Alessandro Vellutello  Lucifero  1534  jpg Lucifer  by Alessandro Vellutello
