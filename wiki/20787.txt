Mary Magdalene  original Greek Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνή   or Mary of Magdala and sometimes The Magdalene  is a religious figure in Christianity  Mary Magdalene traveled with Jesus as one of his followers  She was present at Jesus  two most important moments  the crucifixion and the resurrection  Within the four Gospels she is named at least 12 times  more than most of the apostles  Carol Ann Morrow views the Gospel references as describing her as courageous  brave enough to stand by Jesus in his hours of suffering  death and beyond   The Gospel of Luke says seven demons had gone out of her  and the longer ending of Mark says Jesus had cast seven demons out from her  The  seven demons  may refer to a complex illness  not to any form of sinfulness  She is most prominent in the narrative of the crucifixion of Jesus  at which she was present  and of the events on the morning after the immediately following sabbath  when  according to all four canonical Gospels  she was either alone or as a member of a group of women the first to testify to the resurrection of Jesus  and specifically name her as the first person to see Jesus after his resurrection   Mary Magdalene was there at the  beginning of a movement that was going to transform the West   She was the  Apostle to the Apostles   an honorific that fourth century orthodox theologian Augustine gave her and that others earlier had possibly conferred on her   Ideas that go beyond the gospel presentation of Mary Magdalene as a prominent representative of the women who followed Jesus have been put forward over the centuries  These include giving her a role similar to that of Simon Peter among the male disciples  believing that she had been a harlot  or that she was the secret lover or wife of Jesus and the mother of their child   Mary Magdalene is considered to be a saint by the Catholic  Orthodox  Anglican and Lutheran churches — with a feast day of July 22  Other Protestant churches honor her as a heroine in the faith  The Eastern Orthodox churches also commemorate her on the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers  the Orthodox equivalent of one of the Western Three Marys traditions   1  Identity  Marys in the New Testament  Mary was a very common name in New Testament times  held by a number of women in the canonical Gospels  The reception history of Mary Magdalene has been greatly affected by different interpretations as to which biblical references actually refer to her  beyond those where she is identified by the toponym  Magdalene   Historically  the Greek Orthodox church Fathers  as a whole  distinguished among what they believed were three Marys   The Virgin Mary  mother of Christ  Mary of Bethany  the sister of Martha and Lazarus and  Mary Magdalene In addition  there were Mary  the mother of James and Mary Salome   In the four Gospels  Mary Magdalene is nearly always distinguished from other women named Mary by adding  the Magdalene   ἡ Μαγδαληνή  to her name  This has been interpreted to mean  the woman from Magdala   a town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee  says that she was actually  called Magdalene   In Hebrew מגדל Migdal means  tower    fortress   in Aramaic   Magdala  means  tower  or  elevated  great  magnificent   Talmudic passages speak of a Miriam  hamegadela se’ar nasha    Miriam  the plaiter of women’s hair   Hagigah 4b  cf  Shabbat 104b   which could be a reference to Mary Magdalene serving as a hairdresser   In the Gospel of John  Mary Magdalene is also referred to simply as  Mary  at least twice  Gnostic writings use Mary  Mary Magdalene  or Magdalene   Mary Magdalene s name is mostly given as Μαρία  Maria   but in Matthew 28 1 as Μαριάμ  Mariam   both of which are regarded as Greek forms of Miriam  the Hebrew name for Moses  sister  The name had become very popular during Jesus  time due to its connections to the ruling Hasmonean and Herodian dynasties   2  The  composite Magdalene  of the Middle Ages  It is almost universally agreed today that characterizations of Mary Magdalene in Western Christianity as a repentant prostitute or loose woman are unfounded  arising from conflating or merging her identity with the unnamed sinner who anoints Jesus  feet in   The figures of Mary Magdalene  the anointing sinner of Luke  and Mary of Bethany  who in also anoints Jesus  feet  were long regarded as the same person  Though Mary Magdalene is named in each of the four gospels in the New Testament  none of the clear references to her indicate that she was a prostitute or notable for a sinful way of life  nor link her with Mary of Bethany  Modern scholarship has restored the understanding of Mary of Magdala as an important early Christian leader   The notion of Mary Magdalene being a repentant sinner can be traced at least as far back as Ephraim the Syrian in the fourth century  and became the generally accepted view in Western Christianity because of its acceptance in an influential homily of Pope Gregory I   Gregory the Great   in about 591  in which he identified Magdalene not only with the anonymous sinner with the perfume in Luke s gospel  but also with Mary of Bethany  the sister of Martha and Lazarus  this interpretation is often called the  composite Magdalene  in modern scholarship  The seven devils removed from her by Jesus  morphed into the seven capital sins  and Mary Magdalene began to be condemned not only for lust but for pride and covetousness as well    The aspect of the repentant sinner became almost equally significant as the disciple in her persona as depicted in Western art and religious literature  fitting well with the great importance of penitence in medieval theology  In subsequent religious legend  Mary s story became conflated with that of St Mary of Egypt  another repentant prostitute who then lived as a hermit  With that  Mary’s image was  according to Susan Haskins  author of Mary Magdalene  Myth and Metaphor  “finally settled   for nearly fourteen hundred years ” although in fact the most important late medieval popular accounts of her life describe her as a rich woman whose life of sexual freedom is purely for pleasure   The  composite Magdalene  was never accepted by the Eastern Orthodox churches  who saw only Mary the disciple  and believed that after the Resurrection she lived as a companion to the Virgin Mary  and not even in the West was it universally accepted  The Benedictine Order always celebrated Mary of Bethany together with Martha and Lazarus of Bethany on 29 July  while Mary Magdalene was celebrated on 22 July  Not only John Chrysostom in the East  Matthew  Homily 88   but also Ambrose  De virginitate 3 14  4 15  in the West  when speaking of Mary Magdalene after the resurrection of Jesus Christ  far from calling her a harlot  suggest she was a virgin  In 1518  on the brink of the Protestant Reformation  the leading French Renaissance humanist Jacques Lefèvre d Étaples wrote arguing against the conflation of Mary Magdalene  Mary of Bethany and the unnamed sinner in Luke  There was a flurry of books and pamphlets  most opposing Lefèvre d Étaples  but others supporting him  In 1521 his views were formally condemned by the theology faculty of the Sorbonne  and debate died down  overtaken by the larger issues raised by Martin Luther  Although Protestant theologians and biblical commentators such as John Calvin rejected the composite Magdalene  for Luther and Zwingli Mary Magdalene is the composite Magdalene of medieval tradition  belief in it long survived the Reformation in much Protestant devotional literature  where the emphasis of depictions of Mary Magdalene continued to be on the penitent whose sins had been forgiven because of her love for Jesus   From the 12th century Abbot Hugh of Semur  died 1109   Peter Abelard  died 1142   and Geoffrey of Vendome  died 1132  all referred to Mary Magdalene as the sinner who merited the title apostolarum apostola  Apostle to the Apostles   with the title becoming commonplace during the 12th and 13th centuries   The common identification of Mary Magdalene with other New Testament figures was rejected in the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar  with the comment regarding her liturgical celebration on 22 July   No change has been made in the title of today s memorial  but it concerns only Saint Mary Magdalene  to whom Christ appeared after his resurrection  It is not about the sister of Saint Martha  nor about the sinful woman whose sins the Lord forgave      Elsewhere it said of the Roman liturgy of 22 July that  it will make mention neither of Mary of Bethany nor of the sinful woman of Luke 7 36–50  but only of Mary Magdalene  the first person to whom Christ appeared after his resurrection   Mary of Bethany s feast day and that of her brother Lazarus is now on 29 July  the memorial of their sister Martha   Nevertheless  the reputation still lingers  The misidentification of St  Mary Magdalene as a repentant prostitute was followed by many writers and artists into the 1990s  Even today it is promulgated by some secular groups  It is reflected in Martin Scorsese s film adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis s novel The Last Temptation of Christ  in José Saramago s The Gospel According to Jesus Christ  Andrew Lloyd Webber s musical Jesus Christ Superstar  Mel Gibson s The Passion of the Christ  Jean Claude La Marre s Color of the Cross and Hal Hartley s The Book of Life   It was because of this association of St  Mary Magdalene having been a prostitute that she became the patroness of  wayward women   and Magdalene asylums became established to help save women from prostitution   3  New Testament sources  Primary sources about Mary Magdalene can be divided into canonical texts that are collected into the Christian New Testament and apocryphal texts that were left out from the Bible  being judged as heretical during the development of the New Testament canon  These apocryphal sources are usually dated from the end of the 1st to the early 4th century  all possibly written well after St  Mary s death   The canonical gospels are often dated from the second half of the 1st century   In addition  the Gregorian figure of the composite Magdalen developed an elaborate literary and artistic tradition in the Middle Ages   3 1  During Jesus  ministry  The four Gospels included in the New Testament have little to say about Mary Magdalene  With a single exception in the Gospel of Luke  there is no mention of her in the Gospels until the crucifixion   and say Jesus cleansed her of  seven demons   Some interpret this as meaning that he healed her from mental or physical illnesses  The statement in Mark is part of the  longer ending  of that Gospel  not found in the earliest manuscripts  and which may have been a second century addition to the original text  possibly based on the Gospel of Luke   3 2  During the crucifixion  It is at the time of the crucifixion and resurrection that Mary Magdalene comes to the fore in the gospels  Uniquely among the followers of Jesus  she is specified by name  though not consistently by any one gospel  as a witness to three key events  Jesus  crucifixion  his burial  and the discovery that his tomb was empty    Matthew 27 56 and mention Mary Magdalene as a witness to crucifixion  along with various other women  Luke does not name any witnesses  but mentions  women who had followed him from Galilee  standing at a distance   3 3  After the crucifixion  In listing witnesses who saw where Jesus was buried by Joseph of Aramathea  and Matthew 27 61 both name only two people  Mary Magdalene and  the other Mary   who in Mark is  the mother of James   describes the witnesses as  the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee   mentions no other witness to Joseph s burial of Jesus except for Nicodemus  Mark 16 1 says     Mary Magdalene  Mary the mother of James  and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body   The connection with the earlier Anointing of Jesus  and his remarks then  was one of the arguments used in favour of the  composite Magdalen    3 4  After the resurrection  In Mark  Matthew  and John  Mary Magdalene is first witness to the resurrection  John 20 1 names Mary Magdalene in describing who discovered the tomb was empty  says she was accompanied by Salome and Mary the mother of James  while Matthew 28 1 omits Salome  says the group who reported to the disciples the finding of the empty tomb consisted of  Mary Magdalene  Joanna  Mary the mother of James  and the others with them   In the resurrection is announced to the women at the tomb by  two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning  who suddenly appeared next to them   The final chapter of Mark s Gospel contains two narratives relating to Mary Magdalene  firstly that along with Mary the mother of James and Salome  she was advised by  a young man dressed in a white robe  that Jesus had risen  and given instructions to tell Jesus  disciples — and Peter — that he was going before them into Galilee  but through fear they told no one  and secondly  in the longer ending  that Jesus appeared  first  to Mary Magdalene  alone   who then related his appearance to  those who had been with him   but they did not believe her  The occurrence of these two different accounts is one of the factors contributing to the theory that Mark 16 9 20 is a later addition to the Gospel   and both say that Jesus  first post resurrection appearance was to Mary Magdalene  with no mention of others  In   Mary Magdalene is with the other women returning from the empty tomb when they all see the first appearance of Jesus   The first actual appearance by Jesus that Luke mentions is later that day  when Cleopas and an unnamed disciple walked with a fellow traveler who they later realized was Jesus  The longer ending of Mark describes the same appearance as happening after the private appearance to Mary Magdalene  According to Luke  the apostles   and according to the longer ending of Mark  those who had been with him   did not believe Mary s report of what she saw  Neither Mary Magdalene nor any of the other women are mentioned by name in Paul s catalog of appearances at   which he begins with  he appeared to Cephas  then to the twelve    The Gospel of John and the Gospel of Luke also mention  Mary of Bethany   the sister of Lazarus and Martha  Mary and Martha are among the most familiar sets of sisters in the Bible  Both Luke and John describe them as friends of Jesus  Luke s story  though only four verses long  has been a complex source of inspiration  interpretation  and debate for centuries  John s account  which says the sisters had a brother named Lazarus  spans seventy verses   Among the women who are specifically named in the canonical gospels  Mary Magdalene s name is one of the most frequently found  appearing 12 times  always  except for   in connection with the death and resurrection of Jesus  In   the author names three women in sequence   Mary Magdalene  and Mary the mother of James and Joses  and the mother of Zebedee s children   In the Gospel of Mark  the author lists a group of women three times  and each time  Mary Magdalene’s name appears first  In the Gospel of Luke  the author enumerates the women who reported the tomb visit   It was Mary Magdalene  Joanna  Mary the mother of James  and the other women with them   In the Gospel of John  on the other hand  Mary Magdalene is placed after Mary of Clopas   According to Carla Ricci   The place she  Mary Magdalene  occupied in the list cannot be considered fortuitous   because over and over Mary Magdalene s name is placed at the head of specifically named women  indicating her importance among the followers of Jesus  Ricci sees the significance of this as strengthened by a comparison with the lists of the twelve apostles  in which Peter occupies the first position  an indication of his importance   After giving her report that Jesus was risen  Mary Magdalene disappears from the New Testament  While she may have been among the women mentioned in    her name appears nowhere in the Acts of the Apostles  Nor is she mentioned in the epistles of Paul the Apostle or the other epistles   4  Development of the composite Magdalene  4 1  In art  The early notion of Mary Magdalene as a sinner and adulteress was reflected in Western medieval Christian art  where she was the most commonly depicted female figure after the Virgin Mary  She may be shown either as very extravagantly and fashionably dressed  unlike other female figures wearing contemporary styles of clothes  or alternatively as completely naked but covered by very long blonde or reddish blonde hair  The latter depictions represent the Penitent Magdalen  who according to medieval legend  details in next section  had spent a period of repentance as a desert hermit after leaving her life as a follower of Jesus  Her story became conflated in the West with that of Saint Mary of Egypt  a 4th century prostitute turned hermit  whose clothes wore out and fell off in the desert  In medieval depictions Mary s long hair entirely covers her body and preserves her modesty  supplemented in some German versions such as one by Tilman Riemenschneider by thick body hair   but from the 16th century some depictions  like those by Titian  show part of her naked body  the amount of nudity tending to increase in successive periods  Even if covered  she often wears only a drape pulled around her  or an undergarment  In particular  Mary is often shown naked in the legendary scene of her  Elevation   where she is sustained in the desert by angels who raise her up and feed her heavenly manna  as recounted in the Golden Legend  quoted below    Mary Magdalene at the foot of the cross during the Crucifixion appears in an 11th century English manuscript  as an expressional device rather than a historical motif   intended as  the expression of an emotional assimilation of the event  that leads the spectator to identify himself with the mourners   Other isolated depictions occur  but from the 13th century additions to the Virgin Mary and John as the spectators at the Crucifixion become more common  with Mary Magdalene as the most frequently found  either kneeling at the foot of the cross clutching the shaft  sometimes kissing Christ s feet  or standing  usually at the left and behind Mary and John  with her arms stretched upwards towards Christ in a gesture of grief  as in a damaged painting by Cimabue in the upper church at Assisi of c 1290  A kneeling Magdalene by Giotto in the Scrovegni Chapel  c  1305  was especially influential  As Gothic painted crucifixions became crowded compositions the Magdalene became a prominent figure  with a halo and identifiable by her long unbound blonde hair  and usually a bright red dress  As the swooning Virgin Mary became more common  generally occupying the attention of John  the unrestrained gestures of Magdalene increasingly represented the main display of the grief of the spectators  Mary Magdalene is usually shown with long flowing hair  which she wears down over her shoulders  and may use either to cover her nakedness in the desert  or to dry Jesus s feet after washing them  The other women of the New Testament in these same depictions ordinarily have dark hair beneath a scarf  following contemporary standards of propriety by hiding their hair beneath headdresses or kerchiefs  Long hair was only worn loose in public by either prostitutes or  by the end of the Middle Ages  noblewomen  working and middle class women were normally expected to keep their hair covered or at least bound up  with exceptions for festive occasions  in particular brides on their wedding day   According to Robert Kiely   No figure in the Christian Pantheon except Jesus  the Virgin Mary  and John the Baptist has inspired  provoked  or confounded the imagination of painters more than the Magdalene   Apart from the Crucifixion  Mary was often shown in scenes of the Passion of Jesus  when mentioned in the Gospels  such as the Crucifixion  Christ Carrying the Cross and Noli me Tangere  but usually omitted in other scenes showing the Twelve Apostles  such as the Last Supper  As Mary of Bethany  she is shown as present at the Resurrection of Lazarus  her brother  and in the scene with Jesus and her sister Martha  which began to be depicted often in the 17th century  as in Christ in the House of Martha and Mary by Velázquez   4 2  Medieval legends  Between the time of Pope Gregory I  590 604 AD   until Jacobus de Voragine s Golden Legend and Jacques Lefèvre d Étaples  Concerning Mary Magdalene  in 1519 AD  various versions of the Legend of Mary Magdalene circulated in the south of France and Germany  Odo of Cluny wrote a version in the 900s AD that described Mary s family as nobility  and in the Golden Legend they are magnates of royal descent  lords of Bethany and owning much property in Jerusalem  Her sinning is entirely non commercial      Magdalene abounded in riches  and because delight is fellow to riches and abundance of things  and for so much as she shone in beauty greatly  and in riches  so much the more she submitted her body to delight  and therefore she lost her right name  and was called customably a sinner  Most of the later legends speak of a Mary who after the Ascension of Jesus lived as a hermit in a cave for thirty years  communicating with angels  Single  portrait  figures of the Magdalene typically depicted her as the  Penitent Magdalene  in this period of her life  see above   In the words of William Caxton s English translation of the Golden Legend      the blessed Mary Magdalene  desirous of sovereign contemplation  sought a right sharp desert  and took a place which was ordained by the angel of God  and abode there by the space of thirty years without knowledge of anybody  In which place she had no comfort of running water  ne solace of trees  ne of herbs  And that was because our Redeemer did do show it openly  that he had ordained for her refection celestial  and no bodily meats  And every day at every hour canonical she was lifted up in the air of angels  and heard the glorious song of the heavenly companies with her bodily ears  Of which she was fed and filled with right sweet meats  and then was brought again by the angels unto her proper place  in such wise as she had no need of corporal nourishing  The elaborately detailed  and conflicting  legends that brought Mary to Western Europe after Jesus s life on earth were very widely accepted in the Western church  though not at all by Eastern Orthodoxy  which had her retiring with the Virgin Mary  and dying in Ephesus  In the Golden Legend the  right sharp desert  where Mary retires to repent is located near Aix en Provence in the South of France  These legends are covered in the section below on the Roman Catholic tradition   5  New Testament Apocrypha and Gnostic texts  In apocryphal texts  she is portrayed as a visionary and leader of the early movement whom Jesus loved more than he loved the other disciples  Several Gnostic gospels  such as the Gospel of Mary  written in the early 2nd century  see Mary as the special disciple of Jesus who has a deeper understanding of his teachings and is asked to impart this to the other disciples   Several Gnostic writings  usually dated to 2nd and 3rd centuries  paint a drastically different picture of Mary Magdalene from that of the canonical Gospels  In Gnostic writings Mary Magdalene is seen as one of the most important of Jesus  disciples whom he loved more than the others  The Gnostic Gospel of Philip names Mary Magdalene as Jesus  companion  Gnostic writings describe tensions and jealousy between Mary Magdalene and other disciples  especially Peter   5 1  Gospel of Mary  In her introduction in The Complete Gospels  Karen King names the manuscripts available for the Gospel of Mary  She writes that only three fragmentary manuscripts are known to have survived into the modern period  two 3rd century fragments  P  Rylands 463 and P  Oxyrhynchus 3525  published in 1938 and 1983  and a longer 5th century Coptic translation  Berolinensis Gnosticus 8052 1  published in 1955   First discovered in 1896  the Gospel of Mary exalts Mary Magdalene over the male disciples of Jesus  The Gospel of Mary provides important information about the role of women in the early church  although it is missing six pages from the beginning  and four from the middle  It is usually dated to about the same period as that of the Gospel of Philip   The identity of  Mary  appearing as the main character in this Gospel is sometimes disputed  but she is generally believed to be Mary Magdalene  The Gospel of Mary presents her as one of the disciples  says she has seen a private vision from the resurrected Jesus and describes it to other disciples   Peter said to Mary   Sister we know that the Savior loved you more than the rest of woman  Tell us the words of the Savior which you remember which you know  but we do not  nor have we heard them   Mary answered and said   What is hidden from you I will proclaim to you   And she began to speak to them these words   I   she said   I saw the Lord in a vision and I said to Him  Lord I saw you today in a vision   Almost all of Mary s vision is within the lost pages   When Mary had said these things  she fell silent  since it was up to this point that the Savior had spoken to her  Mary is then confronted by Andrew and Peter  who do not take for granted what she says  because she is a woman    Did he then speak secretly with a woman  in preference to us  and not openly  Are we to turn back and all listen to her  Did he prefer her to us   Then Mary grieved and said to Peter   My brother Peter  what do you think  Do you think that I thought this up myself in my heart or that I am lying concerning the Savior   Mary is defended by Levi    But if the Savior made her worthy  who are you to reject her  Surely the Savior knew her very well  For this reason he loved her more than us   The repeated reference in the Gnostic texts of Mary as being loved by Jesus more than the others has been seen as supporting the theory that the Beloved Disciple in the canonical Gospel of John was originally Mary Magdalene  before being later redacted in the Gospel   5 2  Gospel of Philip  Gospel of Philip  dating from the 2nd or 3rd century  survives in part among the texts found in Nag Hammadi in 1945  In a manner very similar to   the Gospel of Philip presents Mary Magdalene among Jesus  female entourage  adding that she was his koinônos  a Greek word variously translated in contemporary versions as partner  associate  comrade  companion   There were three who always walked with the Lord  Mary  his mother  and her sister  and Magdalene  the one who was called his companion  His sister  his mother and his companion were each a Mary  Others  irritation from the love and affection presented by Jesus to Mary Magdalene is claimed in the apocryphal Gospel of Philip  The text is badly fragmented  and speculated but unreliable additions are shown in brackets   And the companion of the saviour was Mary Magdalene  Christ loved Mary more than all the disciples  and used to kiss her often  The rest of the disciples were offended by it and expressed disapproval  They said to him   Why do you love her more than all of us   The Saviour answered and said to them   Why do I not love you like her    5 3  Gospel of Thomas  Gospel of Thomas  usually dated to the late 1st or early 2nd century  was also among the finds in the Nag Hammadi library in 1945  It has two short references to a  Mary   generally regarded as Mary Magdalene  The latter of the two describes the sentiment towards female members of the early Gnostics   Simon Peter said to them  Let Mary go forth from among us  for women are not worthy of the life  Jesus said  Behold  I shall lead her  that I may make her male  in order that she also may become a living spirit like you males  For every woman who makes herself male shall enter into the kingdom of heaven  When the Gospel of Thomas was written  people commonly assumed that men were superior to women  an attitude consistent with the historical context   The manuscript gives 114  secret teachings  of Jesus  Mary is mentioned briefly in saying 21  Here  Mary asks Jesus   Whom are your disciples like   Jesus responds   They are like children who have settled in a field which is not theirs  When the owners of the field come  they will say   Let us have back our field   They  will  undress in their presence in order to let them have back their field and to give it back to them   Following this  Jesus continues his explanation with a parable about the owner of a house and a thief  ending with the common rhetoric   Whoever has ears to hear let him hear    5 4  Pistis Sophia  Pistis Sophia  possibly dating as early as the 2nd century  is the best surviving of the Gnostic writings  Pistis Sophia presents a long dialog with Jesus in the form of his answers to questions from his disciples  Of the 64 questions  39 are presented by a woman who is referred to as Mary or Mary Magdalene  Jesus says of Mary    Mary  thou blessed one  whom I will perfect in all mysteries of those of the height  discourse in openness  thou  whose heart is raised to the kingdom of heaven more than all thy brethren   There is also a short reference to a person named  Martha  among the disciples  possibly the same person who is named as the sister of Mary of Bethany   5 5  In historical fiction  Edgar Saltus s historical fiction novel Mary Magdalene  A Chronicle  1891  depicts her as a heroine living in a castle at Magdala  who moves to Rome becoming the  toast of the tetrarchy   telling John the Baptist she will  drink pearls    sup on peacock s tongues    Ki Longfellow s novel The Secret Magdalene  2005  draws on the Gnostic gospels and other sources to portray Mary as a brilliant and dynamic woman who studies at the fabled library at Alexandria  and shares her knowledge with Jesus   6  Religious views  6 1  Eastern Orthodox tradition  The Eastern Orthodox Church maintains that Mary Magdalene  distinguished from Mary of Bethany and the  sinful woman  who anoints Jesus in Luke  had been a virtuous woman all her life  even before her conversion  They have never celebrated her as a penitent  This view finds expression both in her written life  βίος or vita  and in the liturgical service in her honor that is included in the Menaion and performed on her annual feast day  There is a tradition that Mary Magdalene led so chaste a life that the devil thought she might be the one who was to bear Christ into the world  and for that reason he sent the seven demons to trouble her   Mary Magdalene is honored as one of the first witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus  and received a special commission from him to tell the Apostles of his resurrection  She is often depicted on icons bearing a vessel of ointment  not because of the anointing by the  sinful woman   but because she was among those women who brought ointments to the tomb of Jesus  For this reason  she is called a Myrrhbearer   According to Eastern traditions  she retired to Ephesus with the Theotokos  Mary  the Mother of God  and there she died  Her relics were transferred to Constantinople in 886 and are preserved there   6 2  Roman Catholic traditions  6 2 1  Connection with Gaul  Gregory of Tours  writing in Tours in the 6th century  supported the tradition of the eastern Church that she retired to Ephesus  with no mention of any connection to Gaul  But for most of the Middle Ages  the Western church believed that  after her period as a disciple of Jesus  Mary Magdalene had travelled to the south of France and died there   How a cult of St  Mary Magdalene first arose in Provence has been summed up by Victor Saxer in the collection of essays in La Magdaleine  VIIIe – XIIIe siècle and by Katherine Ludwig Jansen  drawing on popular devotions  sermon literature and iconology  In Provence  Mary is said to have spent her last years alone in the wilderness  fasting and engaging in acts of penitential self discipline  behavior that was rewarded with experiences of ecstatic union with the divine  Depictions of the Penitent Magdalen became enormously popular in preaching and art  see above    The French tradition of Saint Lazarus of Bethany is that Mary  her brother Lazarus  and Maximinus  one of the Seventy Disciples and some companions  expelled by persecutions from the Holy Land  traversed the Mediterranean in a frail boat with neither rudder nor mast and landed at the place called Saintes Maries de la Mer near Arles  Mary Magdalene came to Marseille and converted the whole of Provence  Magdalene is said to have retired to a cave on a hill by Marseille  La Sainte Baume   holy cave  baumo in Provençal   where she gave herself up to a life of penance for thirty years  When the time of her death arrived she was carried by angels to Aix and into the oratory of Maximinus  where she received the viaticum  her body was then laid in an oratory constructed by St  Maximinus at Villa Lata  afterwards called St  Maximin   St  Mary Magdalene s relics were first venerated at the Abbey of la Madaleine  Vézelay in Burgundy from about 1050  Jacobus de Voragine gives the common account of the transfer of the relics of Mary Magdalene from her sepulchre in the oratory of Saint Maximin at Aix en Provence to the newly founded Vézelay  the transportation of the relics is entered as undertaken in 771 by the founder of the abbey  identified as Gerard  Duke of Burgundy  The earliest mention of this episode is the notice of the chronicler Sigebert of Gembloux  died 1112   who asserts that the relics were removed to Vézelay through fear of the Saracens   On December 9  1279  an excavation ordered by Charles II  King of Naples at Saint Maximin la Sainte Baume  Provence  led to the discovery of another purported burial of Mary Magdalene  The shrine was found intact  with an explanatory inscription stating why the relics had been hidden  Charles II commissioned the building of a new Gothic basilica on the site and  in return for providing accommodation for pilgrims  the town s residents were exempt from taxes  Saint Maximin la Sainte Baume gradually displaced Vézelay in popularity and acceptance   The competition between the Cluniac Benedictines of Vézelay and the Dominicans of Saint Maxime occasioned a rash of miraculous literature supporting the one or the other site  Jacobus de Voragine  compiling his Golden Legend before the competition arose  characterized Mary Magdalene as the emblem of penitence  washing the feet of Jesus with her copious tears following the  composite  figure  protectress of pilgrims to Jerusalem  daily lifting by angels at the meal hour in her fasting retreat and many other miraculous happenings in the genre of Romance  ending with her death in the oratory of Saint Maximin  all disingenuously claimed to have been drawn from the histories of Hegesippus and of Josephus   According to another legend  on the way they were shipwrecked on the island of Malta  where Dingli  Rabat  Madliena  Maltese for Magdalene   and Valletta all have chapels or other dedications  Madliena in Gozo also had a chapel dedicated to St  Mary Magdalene  but this was demolished   6 2 2  Penitent  During the Counter Reformation and Baroque periods  late 16th and 17th centuries   the cult of Mary Magdalene saw a great  new popularity as the Catholic Church publicized her as an attractive  persuasive model of repentance and reform  in keeping with the goals of the reform Council of Trent  1545–63   Numerous works of art and theater featuring the tearful penitent Magdalene appeared in the 17th century  As part of this new attention to the cult of the Magdalene  in 1600  her relics were placed in a sarcophagus commissioned by Pope Clement VIII  the head being placed in a separate reliquary  The relics and free standing images were scattered and destroyed at the Revolution  In 1814  the church of La Sainte Baume  also wrecked during the Revolution  was restored  In 1822  the grotto was consecrated afresh  The head of the saint now lies there and has been the centre of many pilgrimages   The traditional Roman Catholic feast day dedicated to St  Mary Magdalene celebrated her position as a  penitent   The Magdalene became a symbol of repentance for the vanities of the world to various sects  In 1969  the Catholic Church removed the description  penitent  from the title of the July 22 feast of Saint Mary Magdalene in the General Roman Calendar  and replaced Luke 7 36 50  the penitent woman  of the Tridentine Mass with John 20 1 2  11 8  meeting of Mary Magdalene with Jesus after his resurrection  as the Gospel reading at Mass  St  Mary Magdalene was the patron of Magdalen College  Oxford  and Magdalene College  Cambridge  both colleges pronounce her name as  maudlin    In contrast  her name was also used for the Magdalen Asylum  institutions for  fallen women    6 2 3  Apostle to the apostles  Mary Magdalene  who according to and was commissioned by the risen Jesus to inform the disciples of his resurrection  is called  the apostle to the apostles    and speak of women  in the plural   including Mary Magdalene  carrying out this function  An early Christian commentary on the Song of Songs  perhaps by Hippolytus of Rome  170–235   has Christ speak of two women  whom it calls Mary and Martha  as apostles to the apostles   Christ showed himself to the  male  apostles and said to them       It is I who appeared to these women and I who wanted to send them to you as apostles     Use of the actual term  apostle to the apostles  or  apostle of the apostles  is first attested much later than the time of Hippolytus  According to Darrell Bock  it first appears in the 10th century  but Katherine Ludwig Jansen says she found no reference to it earlier than the 12th  by which time it was already commonplace  She mentions in particular Hugh of Cluny  1024–1109   Peter Abelard  1079–1142   and Bernard of Clairvaux  1090–1153  among those who gave Mary Magdalene the title of apostolorum apostola  apostle of the apostles   Jane Schaberg adds Geoffrey of Vendôme  c  1065 70–1132    In fact  the equivalent of the phrase apostolorum apostola appears already in the 9th century  Chapter XXVII of the Life of Mary Magdalene written by Rabanus Maurus  c  780 – 4 February 856  is headed  Ubi Magdalenam Christus ad apostolos mittit apostolam  Wherein Christ sends Magdalene as an apostle to the apostles   The same chapter says she did not delay in exercising the office of apostolate with which he had been honoured  apostolatus officio quo honorata fuerat fungi non distulit   Raymond E  Brown  commenting on this fact  remarks that Rabanus Maurus frequently applies the word  apostle  to Mary Magdalene in this work   Because of Mary Magdalene s position as an apostle  though not one of those who became official witnesses to the resurrection  the Catholic Church honoured her by reciting the Creed on her feast day  the only woman to be so honoured apart from Mary  the mother of Jesus   In his apostolic letter Mulieris Dignitatem   On the dignity and vocation of women   part 67 69  dated 15 August 1988  Pope John Paul II dealt with the Easter events in relation to the women being present at the tomb after the Resurrection  in a section entitled  First Witnesses of the Resurrection    6 3  Protestant tradition  The 1549 Book of Common Prayer had on July 22 a feast of Saint Mary Magdalene  with the same Scripture readings as in the Tridentine Mass and with a newly composed collect   Merciful father geue us grace  that we neuer presume to synne through the example of anye creature  but if it shall chaunce vs at any tyme to offende thy dyuine maiestie  that then we maye truly repent  and lament the same  after the example of Mary Magdalene  and by lyuelye faythe obtayne remission of all oure sinnes  throughe the onely merites of thy sonne oure sauiour Christ   The 1552 edition omitted the feast of Saint Mary Magdalene  which was restored to the Book of Common Prayer only after some 400 years   Among the leaders of the Protestant Reformation  for Luther and Zwingli  Mary Magdalene is the composite Magdalene of medieval tradition  but Calvin distinguishes between her  Mary of Bethany  and the sinful woman   Modern Protestants honor her as a disciple and friend of Jesus  Anglican Christians revere her as a saint and may follow her example of repentance  While some interpret the Thirty Nine Articles as forbidding them to call upon her for intercession  other Anglicans  citing the Episcopal burial service  say they can ask the saint to pray for them  The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America honors Mary Magdalene on July 22 as a Lesser Festival   6 4  Easter Egg tradition  For centuries  it has been the custom of many Christians to share dyed and painted eggs  particularly on Easter Sunday  The eggs represent new life  and Christ bursting forth from the tomb  Among Eastern Orthodox Christians this sharing is accompanied by the proclamation  Christ is risen    One tradition concerning Mary Magdalene says that  following the death and resurrection of Jesus  she used her position to gain an invitation to a banquet given by the Roman Emperor Tiberius  When she met him  she held a plain egg in her hand and exclaimed   Christ is risen   The Emperor laughed  and said that Christ rising from the dead was as likely as the egg in her hand turning red while she held it  Before he finished speaking  the egg in her hand turned a bright red  and she continued proclaiming the Gospel to the entire imperial house   Another version of this story can be found in popular belief  mostly in Greece  It is believed that after the Crucifixion  Mary Magdalene and the Virgin Mary put a basket full of eggs at the foot of the cross  There  the eggs were painted red by the blood of the Christ  Then  Mary Magdalene brought them to Tiberius Caesar   6 5  Bahá í tradition  There are many references to Mary Magdalene in the sacred writings of the Bahá í Faith  where she enjoys an exalted status as a heroine of faith and the  archetypal woman of all cycles   `Abdu l Bahá  the son of the founder of the religion  said that she was  the channel of confirmation  to Jesus  disciples  a  heroine  who  re established the faith of the apostles  and was  a light of nearness in his kingdom   `Abdu l Bahá also wrote that  her reality is ever shining from the horizon of Christ    her face is shining and beaming forth on the horizon of the universe forevermore  and that  her candle is  in the assemblage of the world  lighted till eternity   `Abdu l Bahá considered her to be the supreme example of how women are completely equal with men in the sight of God and can at times even exceed men in holiness and greatness  Indeed he claimed that she surpassed all the men of her time  and that  crowns studded with the brilliant jewels of guidance  were upon her head   The Bahá í writings also expand upon the scarce references to her life in the canonical Gospels  with a wide array of extra canonical stories about her and sayings which are not recorded in any other extant historical sources  `Abdu l Bahá claimed that Mary traveled to Rome and spoke before the Emperor Tiberius  which is presumably why Pilate was later recalled to Rome for his cruel treatment of the Jews  a tradition also attested to in the Eastern Orthodox Church   According to the memoirs of Juliet Thompson  `Abdu l Bahá also compared Mary to Juliet  one of his most devoted followers  claiming that she even physically resembled her and that Mary Magdalene was Juliet Thompson s  correspondence in heaven    Bahá ís have noted parallels between Mary Magdalene and the Babí heroine poetess Tahirih  The two are similar in many respects  with Mary Magdalene often being viewed as a Christian antecedent of the latter  while Tahirih in her own right could be described as the spiritual return of the Magdalene  especially given their common  shared attributes of  knowledge  steadfastness  courage  virtue and will power   in addition to their importance within the religious movements of Christianity and the Bahá í Faith as female leaders   7  Speculations  7 1  Name  The name Mary occurs numerous times in the New Testament  There are several people named Mary in the Gospels  There also are several unnamed women who seem to share characteristics with Mary Magdalene  At different times in history  Mary Magdalene has been confused or misidentified with almost every woman in the four Gospels  except the mother of Jesus   7 2   Beloved Disciple  in the Gospel of John  In 1998  Ramon K  Jusino proposed an unprecedented argument that the  Beloved Disciple  of the Gospel of John is Mary Magdalene  Jusino based his argument largely on the Nag Hammadi Gnostic books  rejecting the view of Raymond E  Brown that these books were later developments  and maintaining instead that the extant Gospel of John is the result of modification of an earlier text that presented Mary Magdalene as the Beloved Disciple  Richard J  Hooper does not make the Jusino thesis his own  but says   Perhaps we should not altogether reject the possibility that some Johannine Christians considered Mary Magdalene to be  the disciple whom Jesus loved    Esther A  de Boer likewise presents the idea as  one possibility among others   not as a definitive solution to the problem of the identity of the anonymous disciple   7 3  Conflation with Mary of Bethany  In the Western  composite  tradition  Mary of Bethany was identified with Mary Magdalene  In the Eastern Orthodox traditions  they always were considered separate persons   Mary of Bethany is referred to simply as  Mary  both in and the Gospel of John  Jesus seems to know her family well  and is described as visiting them several times  In Mary anoints Jesus with expensive perfume and wipes his feet with her hair  at which Jesus says that it was intended that  she should save this perfume for the day of my burial   Following this  Mary of Bethany disappears from the narrative  while Mary Magdalene  already described not as receiving Jesus on his visits to Bethany in Judea  but as travelling about in Galilee with Jesus and the Twelve and with many other women  two of whom are named  emerges at Jesus  crucifixion  finding later his tomb empty and being the first to see him after the Resurrection  In the Gospels  Mary Magdalene is referred to simply as  Mary  only in and    The Gnostic texts commonly refer to Mary Magdalene as Mary   7 4  Betrothed to John the Evangelist  The monk and historian Domenico Cavalca  c  1270 1342   citing Jerome  suggested that Mary Magdalene was betrothed to St John the Evangelist   I like to think that the Magdalene was the spouse of John  not affirming it    I am glad and blythe that St Jerome should say so   They were sometimes thought to be the couple at the Wedding at Cana  though the Gospel accounts say nothing of the ceremony being abandoned  The Dominican friar Jacobus de Voragine  c  1230–1298  in his Golden Legend dismisses talk of John and Mary being betrothed and that John had left his bride at the altar to follow Jesus   In 1449 King René d Anjou gave to Angers Cathedral the amphora from Cana in which Jesus changed water to wine  acquiring it from the nuns of Marseilles  who told him that Mary Magdalene had brought it with her from Judea  relating to the legend where she was the jilted bride at the wedding after which John the Evangelist received his calling from Jesus   8  Relationship with Jesus  8 1  Gnostic texts  The Gospel of Philip describes Mary s relation to Jesus by Coptic variants of the Greek κοινωνός  koinōnos   That work uses cognates of koinōnos and Coptic equivalents to refer to the literal pairing of men and women in marriage and sexual intercourse  but also metaphorically  referring to a spiritual partnership  and the reunification of the Gnostic Christian with the divine realm  Mary Magdalene is mentioned as one of three Marys  who always walked with the Lord  and as his companion  Philip 59 6 11   The work also says that the Lord loved her more than all the disciples  and used to kiss her often  63 34 36   Author John Dickson argues that it was common in early Christianity to kiss a fellow believer by way of greeting  thus such kissing would have no romantic connotations  Kripal writes that  the historical sources are simply too contradictory and simultaneously too silent  to make absolute declarations regarding Jesus  sexuality  Bart Ehrman concludes that historical evidence tells us nothing at all about Jesus  sexuality— certainly nothing to indicate that Jesus and Mary had a sexual relationship of any kind   Ehrman  a scholar of the Greek New Testament and Early Christianity  says that the question people ask him most often is whether Mary Magdalene and Jesus of Nazareth married each other  His answer   It is not true that the Dead Sea Scrolls contained Gospels that discussed Mary and Jesus        Nor is it true that the marriage of Mary and Jesus is repeatedly discussed in the Gospels that didn t make it into the New Testament  In fact  it is never discussed at all—never even mentioned  not even once        It is not true that the Gospel of Philip calls Mary Jesus  spouse    The  Gospel of Jesus  Wife   a Coptic papyrus fragment unveiled in 2012  presents Jesus as speaking of his wife   My wife     she will be able to be my disciple   If genuine  it appears to date to around the 6th to 9th centuries AD  and would suggest that some Egyptian Christians of that period believed that Jesus was married  Although it does not contain the name of Mary Magdalene  there has been speculation that she is the woman referred to  However  there is substantial scholarly concern about the fragment s authenticity  with a number of scholars regarding it as a modern forgery   8 2  Medieval dualism  The 13th century Cistercian monk and chronicler Peter of Vaux de Cernay claimed it was part of Catharist belief that the earthly Jesus Christ had a relationship with Mary Magdalene  described as his concubine  Quote   Further  in their secret meetings they said that the Christ who was born in the earthly and visible Bethlehem and crucified at Jerusalem was  evil   and that Mary Magdalene was his concubine – and that she was the woman taken in adultery who is referred to in the Scriptures  the  good  Christ  they said  neither ate nor drank nor assumed the true flesh and was never in this world  except spiritually in the body of Paul  I have used the term  the earthly and visible Bethlehem  because the heretics believed there is a different and invisible earth in which – according to some of them – the  good  Christ was born and crucified    A document  possibly written by Ermengaud of Béziers  undated and anonymous and attached to his Treatise against Heretics  makes a similar statement   9  Gallery  File Maino Magdalena penitente 1615 col par Ginebra jpg Mary
