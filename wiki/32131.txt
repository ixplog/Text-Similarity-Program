Ultima is a series of open world fantasy role playing video games from Origin Systems  Inc  Ultima was created by Richard Garriott  a k a  Lord British  Several games of the series are considered seminal entries in their genre  Electronic Arts currently holds the brand   1  Games  The main Ultima series consists of nine installments  the seventh title is further divided into two parts  grouped into three trilogies  or  Ages   The Age of Darkness  Ultima I III   The Age of Enlightenment  Ultima IV VI   and The Age of Armageddon  Ultima VII IX   The last is also sometimes referred to as  The Guardian Saga  after its chief antagonist  The first trilogy is set in a fantasy world named Sosaria  but during the cataclysmic events of The Age of Darkness  it is sundered and three quarters of it vanish  What is left becomes known as Britannia  a realm ruled by the benevolent Lord British  and is where the later games mostly take place  The protagonist in all the games is a canonically male resident of Earth who is called upon by Lord British to protect Sosaria and  later  Britannia from a number of dangers  Originally  the player character was referred to as  the Stranger   but by the end of Ultima IV he becomes universally known as the Avatar   1 1  Main series  1 1 1  The Age of Darkness  Ultima I III  In Ultima I  The First Age of Darkness  1981   the Stranger is first summoned to Sosaria to defeat the evil wizard Mondain who aims to enslave it  Since Mondain possesses the Gem of Immortality  which makes him invulnerable  the Stranger locates a time machine  travels back in time to kill Mondain before he creates the Gem  and shatters the incomplete artifact   Ultima II  The Revenge of the Enchantress  1982  details Mondain s secret student and lover Minax s attempt to avenge him  Minax launches an attack on the Stranger s homeworld of Earth  Her actions cause doorways to open to various times and locations throughout Earth s history  and brings forth legions of monsters to all of them  The Stranger  after obtaining the Quicksword that alone can harm her  locates the evil sorceress at Castle Shadowguard at the origin of time and defeats her   Ultima III  Exodus  1983  reveals that Mondain and Minax had an offspring  the eponymous Exodus   neither human  nor machine   according to the later games  it is depicted as a computer at the conclusion of the game  and it appears to be a demonic  self aware artificial intelligence   Some time after Minax s death  Exodus starts his own attack on Sosaria and the Stranger is summoned once again to destroy it  Exodus was the first installment of the series featuring a player party system  which was used in many later games   1 1 2  The Age of Enlightenment  Ultima IV   VI  Ultima IV  Quest of the Avatar  1985  marked a turning point in the series from the traditional  hero vs  villain  plots  instead introducing a complex alignment system based upon the Eight Virtues derived from the combinations of the Three Principles of Love  Truth and Courage  Although Britannia now prospers under Lord British s rule  he fears for his subjects  spiritual well being and summons the Stranger again to become a spiritual leader of Britannian people by example  Throughout the game  the Stranger s actions determine how close he comes to the ideal  Upon achieving enlightenment in every Virtue  he can reach the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom and becomes the  Avatar   the embodiment of Britannia s virtues   In Ultima V  Warriors of Destiny  1988   the Avatar returns to Britannia to find that after Lord British had been lost in the Underworld  Lord Blackthorn  who rules in his stead  was corrupted by the Shadowlords and enforces a radically twisted vision of the Virtues  deviating considerably from their original meaning  The Avatar and his companions proceed to rescue the true king  overthrow the tyrant and restore the Virtues in their true form   Ultima VI  The False Prophet  1990  details the invasion of Britannia by Gargoyles  which the Avatar and his companions have to repel  Over the course of the game it is revealed that the Gargoyles have valid reasons to loathe the Avatar  Exploring the themes of racism and xenophobia  the game tasks the Avatar with understanding and reconciling two seemingly opposing cultures   1 1 3  The Age of Armageddon  Ultima VII   IX  Ultima VII  The Black Gate  1992  sees the Avatar entangled in the plan of an ostensibly virtuous and benevolent organization named the Fellowship  inspired by Scientology  to create a gateway for the evil entity known as the Guardian to enter Britannia  An expansion pack was released named Forge of Virtue that added a newly arisen volcanic island to the map that the Avatar was invited to investigate  The tie in storyline was limited to this island  where a piece of Exodus  his data storage unit  had resurfaced  To leave the island again  the Avatar had to destroy this remnant of Exodus  In the process of doing so  he also created The Black Sword  an immensely powerful weapon possessed by a demon   Ultima VII Part Two  Serpent Isle  1993  was released as the second part of Ultima VII because it used the same game engine as Ultima VII  According to interviews  Richard Garriott felt it therefore did not warrant a new number  Production was rushed due to deadlines set to the developers  and the storyline was cut short  remains of the original  longer storyline can be found in the database  Following the Fellowship s defeat  its founder Batlin flees to the Serpent Isle  pursued by the Avatar and companions  Serpent Isle is revealed as another fragment of former Sosaria  and its history which is revealed throughout the game provides many explanations and ties up many loose ends left over from the Age of Darkness era  Magical storms herald the unraveling of the dying world s very fabric  and the game s mood is notably melancholic  including the voluntary sacrificial death of a long standing companion of the Avatar  By the end of the game  the Avatar is abducted by the Guardian and thrown into another world  which becomes the setting for the next game in the series  The Silver Seed was an expansion pack for Ultima VII Part 2 where the Avatar travels back in time to plant a silver seed  thus balancing the forces that hold the Serpent Isle together  Like Forge of Virtue  the expansion contained an isolated sub quest that was irrelevant to the main game s storyline  but provided the Avatar with a plethora of useful and powerful artifacts   In Ultima VIII  Pagan  1994   the Avatar finds himself exiled by the Guardian to a world called  Pagan   The Britannic Principles and Virtues are unknown here  Pagan is ruled by the Elemental Titans  god like servants of the Guardian  The Avatar defeats them with their own magic  ascending to demi godhood himself  and finally returns to Britannia  A planned expansion pack  The Lost Vale  was canceled after Ultima VIII failed to meet sales expectations   Ultima IX  Ascension  1999   the final installment of the series  sees Britannia conquered and its Virtues corrupted by the Guardian  The Avatar has to cleanse and restore them  The Guardian is revealed to be the evil part of the Avatar himself  expelled from him when he became the Avatar  To stop it  he has to merge with it  destroying himself as a separate entity  The unreleased version of the plot featured a more apocalyptic ending  with the Guardian and Lord British killed  Britannia destroyed  and the Avatar ascending to a higher plane of existence   1 1 4

the main series  has become an unexpected hit  making it one of the earliest and longest running successful MMORPGs of all time  Its lore retconned the ending of Ultima I  stating that when the Stranger shattered the Gem of Immortality  he discovered that it was tied to the world itself  therefore its shards each contained a miniature version of Britannia  The player characters in Ultima Online exist on these  shards   Eight expansion packs for UO have been released  The Second Age  Renaissance  Third Dawn  Lord Blackthorn s Revenge  Age of Shadows  Samurai Empire  Mondain s Legacy and Stygian Abyss    The aging UO graphic engine was renewed in 2007 with the official Kingdom Reborn client  Ultima Online 2  later renamed to Ultima Worlds Online  Origin and canceled in 2001  would have introduced steampunk elements to the game world  following Lord British s unsuccessful attempt to merge past  present  and future shards together   UO spawned two sequel efforts that were canceled before release  Ultima Worlds Online  Origin  canceled in 2001  though the game s storyline was published in the Technocrat War trilogy   and Ultima X  Odyssey  canceled in 2004   Ultima X  Odyssey  2004  would have continued the story of Ultima IX  Now merged with the Guardian  the Avatar creates a world of Alucinor inside his mind  where the players were supposed to pursue the Eight Virtues in order to strengthen him and weaken the Guardian  Ultima X was developed without participation of the original creator Richard Garriott and he no longer owns the rights to the series  However  he still owns the rights to several of the game characters so it is impossible for either him or Electronic Arts to produce a new Ultima title without getting permission from each other   1 5  Lord of Ultima  Lord of Ultima is a free to play browser based MMORTS released in 2010 by EA Phenomic  It is the first release in the Ultima series since Ultima Online  and also the first title to have no involvement from series creator Garriott or founding company Origin  It has been criticized for having slow paced gameplay and very weak connections to the Ultima franchise lore  EA has announced that Lord of Ultima will be shut down and taken offline as of May 12  2014   1 6  Ultima Forever  Quest for the Avatar  Announced in summer 2012  Ultima Forever is a free to play online action role playing game  In contrast to Lord of Ultima  Ultima Forever returns to the lore of the original game series   1 7  Other media  Several novels were released under the Ultima name  including   The Ultima Saga by Lynn Abbey  Warner Books   The Forge of Virtue  1991   The Temper of Wisdom  1992   Ultima  The Technocrat War by Austen Andrews  Pocket Books   Machinations  2001   Masquerade  2002   Maelstrom  2002  In Japan  an Ultima soundtrack CD  two kinds of wrist watches  a tape dispenser  a pencil holder  a board game  a jacket  and a beach towel were released  There was also an Ultima anime cartoon   Three manga comics were released in Japan   Ultima  EXODUS No Kyoufu  The Terror of EXODUS   Ultima  Quest of the Avatar  Ultima  Magincia no Metsubou  The Fall of Magincia   2  Packaging  Ultima game boxes often contained so called  feelies   e g  from Ultima II on  every game in the main series came with a cloth map of the game world  Starting with Ultima IV  small trinkets like pendants  coins and magic stones were found in the boxes  Made of metal or glass  they usually represented an important object also found within the game itself   Not liking how games were sold in zip lock bags with a few pages printed out for instructions  Richard Garriott insisted Ultima II be sold in a box  with a cloth map  and a manual  Sierra was the only company at that time willing to agree to this  and thus he signed with them   3  Anti piracy measures  In the Atari 8bit version of Ultima IV one of the floppy disks had an unformatted track  In its absence the player would lose on every fight  which would not be obvious as a copy protection effect right away as one could assume that this was just due to either lack of experience or proper equipment  The protection mechanism was subtle enough to be overlooked by the German distributor which originally delivered Atari 8bit packages with floppies that were formatted regularly  and thus these paid copies acted like pirated copies  causing players to lose every battle   In Ultima V  there were one or two instances where ostensibly insignificant information found in the accompanying booklet were asked by person s  encountered in the game  The game also used runic script in some places and a special language for spell names  for both of which the necessary translation tables   explanations were provided in the booklet  These can be seen as subtle copy protection measures  well fitted for the context of history and fantasy so that a casual player didn t take them for copy protection   Ultima VI introduced a more systematic use of copy protection in the form of in game questions  preventing the player from progressing any further if the questions were answered incorrectly  In Ultima VII  this practice was continued  although in both games the player had an unlimited number of tries to answer the questions correctly  Answers could be obtained by consulting the manual or cloth map  although the manual released with the Ultima Collection contained all copy protection answers for every game   In Ultima VII Part 2  Serpent Isle  the copy protection was changed slightly  Players were asked questions at two points in the game  and if they could not answer after two attempts  all NPCs said nothing but altered versions of famous quotes  such as  My kingdom for a hammer     Honor thy father and thy hoe  babycakes  and  Oh my  twig  I don t think we re in Britannia anymore   Everything would also be labeled  Oink    preventing the game from being playable  From Ultima VIII onward  copy protection questions were discontinued   4  Common elements  4 1  Setting  Originally  the world of Ultima was made up of four continents  These were Lord British s Realm  ruled by Lord British and the Lost King  The Lands of Danger and Despair  ruled by Lord Shamino and the King of the White Dragon  The Lands of the Dark Unknown  ruled by Lord Olympus and the King of the Black Dragon  and The Lands of the Feudal Lords  ruled by the lords of Castle Rondorin and Castle Barataria   After the defeat of Mondain and the shattering of his Gem of Immortality in Ultima I  there was a cataclysm that changed the structure of the world  Three of the four continents seemingly disappeared  leaving only Lord British s realm in the world  This remaining continent was referred from then on as  Sosaria   The Lands of Danger and Despair were later rediscovered as the Serpent Isle  which had been moved to a different dimension or plane  so it seems likely that the other two continents still exist  Ultima II shows Castle Barataria on Planet X  suggesting that the Lands of the Feudal Lords became this planet  Ultima Online  Samurai Empire posits that the Lands of the Feudal Lords was transformed into the Tokuno Islands by the cataclysm   After the defeat of Exodus in Ultima III  Sosaria became Britannia in order to honor its ruler  Lord British  Serpent Isle remained connected with Britannia via a gate in the polar region  The Fellowship leader  Batlin  fled here after the Black Gate was destroyed in Ultima VII  preventing the Guardian s first invasion  Ninety percent of the island s population was destroyed by evil Banes released by Batlin in a foolish attempt to capture them for his own use in Ultima VII Part 2   4 2  Virtues  In Ultima  the player takes the role of the Avatar  who embodies eight virtues  First introduced in Ultima IV  the Three Principles and the Eight Virtues marked a reinvention of the game focus from a traditional role playing model into an ethically framed one  Each virtue is associated with a party member  one of Britannia s cities  and one of the eight other planets in Britannia s solar system  Each virtue also has a mantra and each principle a word of power that the player must learn  The Eight Virtues explored in Ultima are Honesty  Compassion  Valor  Justice  Sacrifice  Honor  Spirituality  and Humility  These Eight Virtues are based on the Three Principles of Truth  Love  and Courage  The Principles are derived from the One True Axiom  the combination of all Truth  all Love  and all Courage  which is Infinity   The virtues were first introduced in Ultima IV  Quest of the Avatar  1985   where the goal of the game is to practice them and become a moral exemplar  Virtues and their variations are present in all later installments  Richard Garriott s motives in designing the virtue system were to build on the fact that games were provoking thought in the player  even unintentionally  As a designer  he  wasn t interested in teaching any specific lesson  instead  his next game would be about making people think about the consequences of their actions   The original virtue system in Ultima was partially inspired by the 16 ways of purification which lead to Avatarhood in Hinduism  He also drew on his interpretation of characters from The Wizard of Oz  with the Scarecrow representing truth  the Tin Woodsman representing love  and the Cowardly Lion representing courage   The Virtues have become a frequent theme in the Ultima games following Ultima IV  with many different variants used throughout the series  Ultima V  Warriors of Destiny saw Lord Blackthorn turn the virtue system into a rigid and draconian set of laws  The rigid system of Blackthorn unintentionally causes the Virtues to actually achieve their polar opposites  in part due to the influence of the Shadowlords  This shows that the Virtues always come from one s own self  and that codifying ethics into law does not automatically make evil people good  Ultima VI  The False Prophet confronted the Avatar with the fact that  from another point of view  the Avatar s quests for Virtue may not appear virtuous at all  presenting an alternative set of virtues  In Ultima VII  an order known as the Fellowship displaced the Virtues with its own seemingly benevolent belief system  casting Britannia into disarray  and in Ultima IX  the Virtues had been inverted into their opposite anti virtues   Ultima s virtue system was considered a new frontier in game design  and has become  an industry standard  especially within role playing games   The original system from Ultima IV has influenced moral systems in games such as Black & White  Star Wars  Knights of the Old Republic and the Fable series  However  Ultima can only be won by being virtuous  while other games typically offer a choice to be vicious  Mark Hayse specifically praises Ultima s virtue system for its subtlety  The game emphasizes the importance of virtue  but leaves the practice ambiguous with no explicit point values and limited guidance  This makes the virtue system more of a  philosophical journey  than an ordinary game puzzle   4 3  Characters  4 4  Artificial scripts  The Ultima series of computer games employed several different artificial scripts  The people of Britannia  the fantasy world where the games are set  speak English  and most of the day to day things are written in Latin alphabet  However  there still are other scripts  which are used by tradition   Britannian runes are the most commonly seen script  In many of the games of the series  most of the signs are written in runes  with no actual transcription for them given  The runes are based on Germanic runes  but are slightly different  They are very reminiscent of the Dwarven runes in Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings  which Ultima creator Richard Garriott has stated he has read  The runes have been used since the early games  They gained steadier use in the games proper since Ultima V  which was the first game in series to feature a runic font and use it for most of the display of various signs  Earlier games featured runes only in other graphics  for example  in Ultima IV  visions from meditating use runic letters  The runes are used less in Ultima VII and in later games   Gargish is the language of the gargoyles of Britannia and the language used in spellcasting within the game  The language is complex and flexible  but the vocabulary is prohibitively small  limiting its use  The Gargish language has its own alphabet  although it can also be written in the Latin alphabet  The difference between nouns  verbs  and adjectives is expressed through intonations and gestures  Because of this  written Gargish uses suffixes to denote part of speech  grammatical tense  and grammatical aspect  In some cases  these suffixes are also used as independent words  Gargoyles avoid using pronouns or verb tense unless it is crucial to comprehension  therefore the language is often spoken in the infinitive  e g    To say hello    The Gargish alphabet is featured in Ultima VI  though it is seen in the games very rarely  Ultima VII and onward does not feature anything written in the alphabet  with the sole exception of some books to be found in the gargoyle colony in the underwater city of Ambrosia in Ultima IX  The Gargish language and alphabet were designed by Herman Miller   The Ophidian alphabet  featured in Ultima VII Part Two  Serpent Isle  was used by the ophidian civilization that inhabited the Serpent Isle  It is based on various snake forms  Ophidian lettering was quite difficult to read  so the game included a Translation spell that made the letters look like Latin letters   5  Reception  In 1996  Next Generation ranked the Ultima series as collectively the 55th top game of all time  commenting that  while the graphics and playing style change with the technological leaps of the day   it  has been the most consistent source roleplaying excitment in history   In 2000  Britannia was included in GameSpot s list of the ten best game worlds  called  the oldest and one of the most historically rich gameworlds    6  Impact and legacy  Many innovations of the early Ultimas   in particular Ultima III  Exodus  1983    eventually became standard among later RPGs  such as the use of tiled graphics and party based combat  its mix of fantasy and science fiction elements  and the introduction of time travel as a plot device  In turn  some of these elements were inspired by Wizardry  specifically the party based combat  Exodus was also revolutionary in its use of a written narrative to convey a larger story than the typically minimal plots that were common at the time  Most video games   including Garriott s own Ultima I and II and Akalabeth   tended to focus primarily on things like combat without venturing much further  In addition  Garriott would introduce in Ultima IV a theme that would persist throughout later Ultimas   a system of chivalry and code of conduct in which the player  or  Avatar   is tested periodically  in both obvious and unseen ways  and judged according to his or her actions  This system of morals and ethics was unique  in that in other video games players could for the most part act and do as they wished without having to consider the consequences of their actions   Ultima III would go on to be released for many other platforms and influence the development of such RPGs as Excalibur and Dragon Quest  and many consider the game to be the first modern CRPG   6 1  Shroud of the Avatar  Forsaken Virtues  Richard Garriott s new company Portalarium is developing an MMORPG that Garriott has described as a clear spiritual successor of the Ultima series  On March 8  2013  Portalarium launched a Kickstarter campaign for Shroud of the Avatar  Forsaken Virtues  Forsaken Virtues is the first of five full length episodic installments in Shroud of the Avatar  Estimated availability of Forsaken Virtues  is October 2014  with Episodes 2 through 5 estimated for subsequent yearly releases  Ultima Online project director Starr Long has joined Portalarium as executive producer for Shroud of the Avatar   7  References  8  Notes  9  External links   redirects to the Ultima Online website     Information and files concerning the entire saga
