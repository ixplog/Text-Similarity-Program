Romantic comedy films are films with light hearted  humorous plotlines  centered on romantic ideals such as that true love is able to surmount most obstacles  One dictionary definition is  a funny movie  play  or television program about a love story that ends happily   Another definition states that its  primary distinguishing feature is a love plot in which two sympathetic and well matched lovers are united or reconciled    Romantic comedy films are a certain genre of comedy films as well as of romance films  and may also have elements of screwball comedies and stoner comedies  Some television series can also be classified as romantic comedies   Pretty Woman is considered by many critics to be the most successful movie in the genre   1  Description  The basic plot of a romantic comedy is that two characters  usually a man and a woman  meet  part ways due to an argument or other obstacle  then ultimately reunite  Sometimes the two leads meet and become involved initially  then must confront challenges to their union  Sometimes they are hesitant to become romantically involved because they believe that they do not like each other  because one of them already has a partner  or because of social pressures  However  the screenwriters leave clues that suggest that the characters are  in fact  attracted to each other and that they would be a good love match  The protagonists often separate or seek time apart to sort out their feelings or deal with the external obstacles to their being together   While the two protagonists are separated  one or both of them usually realizes that they are ideal for each other  or that they are in love with each other  Then  after one of the two makes some spectacular effort  sometimes called the grand gesture  to find the other person and declare their love  or through an astonishing coincidental encounter  the two meet again  Then  perhaps with some comic friction or awkwardness  they declare their love for each other and the film ends happily  The couple does not  however  have to marry  or live together  happily ever after   The ending of a romantic comedy is meant to affirm the primary importance of the love relationship in its protagonists  lives  even if they physically separate in the end  e g  Shakespeare in Love  Roman Holiday    There are many variations on this basic plotline  Sometimes  instead of the two lead characters ending up in each other s arms  another love match will be made between one of the principal characters and a secondary character  e g   My Best Friend s Wedding and My Super Ex Girlfriend   Alternatively  the film may be a rumination on the impossibility of love  as in Woody Allen s film Annie Hall  The basic format of a romantic comedy film can be found in much earlier sources  such as Shakespeare plays like Much Ado About Nothing and A Midsummer Night s Dream   Some comedy films  such as Knocked Up  combine themes of romantic comedies and stoner comedies  creating a subgenre that appeals to both men and women  Often known as  bromance   such films usually use sexual elements which bring the two characters together  Films in this genre include American Pie 2 and even Wedding Crashers   2  Evolution and Subgenres  Romantic comedies have begun to spread out of their conventional and traditional structure into other territory  This territory explores more subgenres and more complex topics  These films still follow the typical plot of  a light and humorous movie  play  etc   whose central plot is a happy love story  but with more complexity  These are a few ways romantic comedies are adding more subtlety and complexity into the genre   2 1  Extreme circumstances  Some Romantic comedies have adopted extreme or strange circumstances for the main characters  as in Warm Bodies where the protagonist is a zombie who falls in love with a human girl after eating her boyfriend  Another strange set of circumstances is in Zack and Miri Make a Porno where the two protagonists are building a relationship while trying to make a porno together  Both these films take the typical story arch and then utilize circumstances to add originality   2 2  Flipping Conventions  Other Romantic Comedies flip the standard conventions of the Romantic Comedy genre  In films like 500 Days of Summer the two main interests do not end up together  leaving the protagonist somewhat distraught  While other films like Adam  2009 film  have the two main interests end up separated but still content and pursuing other goals and love interests   2 3  Serious Elements  Other remakes of Romantic Comedies involve similar elements but explore more adult themes such as marriage  responsibility or even disability  Two films by Judd Apatow such as This is 40 or Knocked Up deal with these before mentioned issues  This is 40 chronicles the mid life crisis of a couple entering their 40 s and Knocked Up addresses unintended pregnancy and the ensuing assuming of responsibility  While Silver Linings Playbook deals with mental illness and unrequited love that is never resolved   All of these go against the stereotype of what Romantic Comedy has become as a genre  Yet the genre of Romantic Comedy is simply a structure and all of these elements do not negate the fact that these films are still Romantic Comedies   3  Contrived romantic encounters  the  meet cute   One of the conventions of romantic comedy films is the funny parts and contrived encounter of two potential romantic partners in unusual or comic circumstances  which film critics such as Roger Ebert or the Associated Press  Christy Lemire have called a  meet cute  situation  During a  meet cute   scriptwriters often create a humorous sense of awkwardness between the two potential partners by depicting an initial clash of personalities or beliefs  an embarrassing situation  or by introducing a comical misunderstanding or mistaken identity situation  Sometimes the term is used without a hyphen  a  meet cute    or as a verb   to meet cute     Roger Ebert describes the  concept of a Meet Cute  as  when boy meets girl in a cute way   As an example  he cites  The Meet Cute in Lost and Found  which  has Jackson and Segal running their cars into each other in Switzerland  Once recovered  they Meet Cute again when they run into each other while on skis  Eventually     they fall in love    In many romantic comedies  the potential couple comprises polar opposites  two people of different temperaments  situations  social statuses  or all three  It Happened One Night   who would not meet or talk under normal circumstances  and the meet cute s contrived situation provides the opportunity for these two people to meet   3 1  Use of  meet cute  situations  Certain movies are entirely driven by the meet cute situation  and contrived circumstances throw the couple together for much of the screenplay  However  movies in which the contrived situation is the main feature  such as Some Like It Hot  rather than the romance being the main feature  are not considered  meet cutes    The use of the meet cute is less marked in television series and novels  because these formats have more time to establish and develop romantic relationships  In situation comedies  relationships are static and meet cute is not necessary  though flashbacks may recall one  The Dick Van Dyke Show  Mad About You  and lighter fare may require contrived romantic meetings   The heyday of  meet cute  in films was during the Great Depression in the 1930s  screwball comedy films made a heavy use of contrived romantic  meet cutes   perhaps because the more rigid class consciousness and class divisions of this period made cross social class romances into tantalizing fantasies   While film critic Roger Ebert has popularized the term  meet cute  in his reviews of romantic comedies  the term is mostly used in the film and screenwriting industries  where it provides a convenient shorthand for screenwriters who are doing a very compressed pitch to a film production company   4  History  The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms defines romantic comedy as  a general term for comedies that deal mainly with the follies and misunderstandings of young lovers  in a light‐hearted and happily concluded manner which usually avoids serious satire   This reference states that the  best‐known examples are Shakespeare s comedies of the late 1590s  A Midsummer Night s Dream  Twelfth Night  and As You Like It being the most purely romantic  while Much Ado About Nothing approaches the comedy of manners and The Merchant of Venice is closer to tragicomedy    Comedies since ancient Greece have often incorporated sexual or social elements   It was not until the creation of romantic love in the western European medieval period  though  that  romance  came to refer to  romantic love  situations  rather than the heroic adventures of medieval Romance  These adventures  however  often revolved about a knight s feats on behalf of a lady  and so the modern themes of love were quickly woven into them  as in Chrétien de Troyes s Lancelot  the Knight of the Cart   Shakespearean comedy and Restoration comedy remain influential  The creation of huge economic social strata in the Gilded Age  combined with the heightened openness about sex after the Victorian era and the celebration of Sigmund Freud s theories  and the birth of the film industry in the early twentieth century  gave birth to the screwball comedy  As class consciousness declined and World War II unified various social orders  the savage screwball comedies of the twenties and thirties  proceeding through Rock Hudson–Doris Day style comedies  gave way to more innocuous comedies  This style faded in the 1960s  and the genre lay mostly dormant until the more sexually charged When Harry Met Sally had a successful box office run in 1989  paving the way for a rebirth for the Hollywood romantic comedy in the mid 1990s   The French film industry went in a completely different direction  with less inhibitions about sex  Virginia Woolf  tired of stories that ended in  happily ever after  at the beginning of a serious relationship  called Middlemarch by George Eliot  with its portrayal of a difficult marriage   one of the few English novels written for grown up people    5  See also  Bromantic comedy
