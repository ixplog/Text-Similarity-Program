The foreign relations of Mexico are directed by the President of the United Mexican States and managed through the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs  The principles of the foreign policy are constitutionally recognized in the Article 89  Section 10  which include  respect for international law and legal equality of states  their sovereignty and independence  non intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries  peaceful resolution of conflicts  and promotion of collective security through active participation in international organizations  Since the 1930s  the Estrada Doctrine has served as a crucial complement to these principles   After the War of Independence  the relations of Mexico were focused primarily on the United States  its northern neighbor  largest trading partner  and the most powerful actor in hemispheric and world affairs  Once the order was reestablished  its foreign policy was built under hemispheric prestige in subsequent decades  Demonstrating independence from the U S   Mexico supported the Cuban government since its establishment in the early 1960s  the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua during the late 1970s  and leftist revolutionary groups in El Salvador during the 1980s  In the 2000s  former President Vicente Fox adopted a new foreign policy that calls for an openness and an acceptance of criticism from the international community and the increase of Mexican involvement in foreign affairs  as well as a further integration towards its northern neighbors  A greater priority to Latin America and the Caribbean was given during the administration of President Felipe Calderón   Mexico is one of the founding members of several international organizations  most notably the United Nations  the Organization of American States  the Organization of Ibero American States  the OPANAL and the Rio Group  For a long time  Mexico has been one of the largest contributors to the United Nations regular budget  in 2008 over 40 million dollars were given to the organization  In addition  it was the only Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development since it joined in 1994 until the accession of Chile in 2010  Mexico is considered as a newly industrialized country  a regional power and an emerging market  hence its presence in major economic groups such as the G8+5 and the G 20  In addition  since the 1990s Mexico has sought a reform of the United Nations Security Council and its working methods with the support of Argentina  Italy  Pakistan and nine other countries  which form a group informally called the Coffee Club   1  Foreign policy  The Article 89  Section 10 of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States states the principles of the Mexican foreign policy  which were officially incorporated in 1988  The direction that the foreign policy will take lies on the President  as the head of state  and it is executed through the Secretary of Foreign Affairs  Textually  the article establishes that   Aside from these principles constitutionally recognized  the foreign policy has been based on some doctrines  The Estrada Doctrine as the most influential and representative instrument in this field  proclaimed in the early 1930s and strictly applied until 2000  claimed that foreign governments should not judge  positively or negatively  the governments or changes in government of other nations  in that such action would imply a breach to their sovereignty  This policy was said to be based on the principles of non intervention  peaceful resolution of disputes and self determination of all nations  During the first presidency of the National Action Party  Vicente Fox appointed Jorge Castañeda to be his Secretary of Foreign Affairs  Castañeda immediately broke with the Estrada Doctrine  promoting what was called by critics the  Castañeda Doctrine   The new foreign policy called for an openness and an acceptance of criticism from the international community  and the increase of Mexican involvement in foreign affairs   On November 28  2006  President elect Felipe Calderón announced that Patricia Espinosa would serve as his Secretary of Foreign Affairs starting on December 1  2006  Her declared priorities include the diversification of the United States Mexico agenda  heavily concentrated on immigration and security issues  and the rebuilding of diplomatic relations with Cuba and Venezuela  which were heavily strained during the Fox administration  As well as giving greater priority to Latin America and the Caribbean states   2  Diplomatic relations  The Mexican foreign service officially started in 1822  the year after the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba  which marked the beginning of the country s independence  In 1831  legislation was passed that underpinned the establishment of diplomatic representations with other states in Europe and the Americas   As a regional power and emerging market  Mexico holds a significant global presence  As of 2009  the Secretary of Foreign Affairs has over 150 representations at its disposal overseas  which include   79 embassies   67 consulates   7 permanent missions  In the early 1970s  Mexico recognized the People s Republic of China as the sole and legitimate government of China  therefore issues related to the Republic of China  Taiwan  are managed through the Office of Consular Liaison under the circumscription of the Consulate General of Mexico in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau  In addition  Mexico does not recognize Kosovo as an independent country   Historically  Mexico has remained neutral in international conflicts  However  in recent years some political parties have proposed an amendment of the Constitution in order to allow the Mexican army  air force or navy to collaborate with the United Nations in peacekeeping missions  or to provide military help to countries that officially ask for it   3  Bilateral relations  3 1  North America  Since the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  went into effect on January 1  1994  relations between Canada  Mexico and the United States have significantly strengthened politically  economically  socially and culturally  During the Fox administration  a further integration towards Mexico s northern neighbors was a top priority  The September 11 attacks changed the priorities of U S  foreign policy toward the strengthening of regional security  As a result  several trilateral summit meetings regarding this issue have occurred within the framework of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America  SPP   a region level dialogue with the stated purpose of providing greater cooperation on security and economic issues  founded in Waco  Texas on March 23  2005 by Paul Martin  former Prime Minister of Canada  Vicente Fox  then President of Mexico  and George W  Bush  former President of the United States   Other issues of concern are the ones related to conservation and protection of the environment  the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation  NAAEC  consists of a declaration of principles and objectives concerning this issues as well as concrete measures to further cooperation on these matters tripartitely  In addition  the Independent Task Force on North America advocates a greater economic and social integration between Canada  Mexico and the U S  as a region  It is a group of prominent business  political and academic leaders from the three countries organized and sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations  U S    the Canadian Council of Chief Executives  and the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations   3 2   Formal relations did not begin until 1944  at the height of the Second World War  which both countries participated in on the Allied side  Prior to the negotiations around the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   economic and political ties between Mexico and Canada were relatively weak  Since NAFTA has come into force  the two countries have become much more important to each other  and often collaborate when dealing with the United States  for example with issues related to the economic embargo imposed to Cuba   Currently  Mexico and Canada are close friends and strategic partners and benefit from a very active bilateral relationship which includes ever increasing commercial ties  high level political exchanges and an expanding collaborative network between Mexicans and Canadians in areas such as climate change  culture  energy  education  good governance  human rights and public service modernization  And more recently  both countries have been building a closer security and defense relationship   In recent years  both partners along with Italy  Argentina  Pakistan and other eight countries have sought a reform of the United Nations Security Council and its working methods Which form a group informally called the Coffee Club  that opposes to the proposition of the G4   3 3   When Mexico finally gained its independence from Spain in 1821  the United States was the first country to recognize it  On December 12  1822 the then United States Secretary of State John Quincy Adams introduced José Manuel Zozoya  the first Mexican representative  to the then U S  president James Monroe in the White House  Through this event  the U S  recognized de facto the independence of Mexico and the recently born Mexican Empire led by Agustín de Iturbide  However  Washington did not establish diplomatic relations formally with Mexico until 1825  naming Joel Poinsett as its representative  who had the mission of buying territory and getting trading facilities   The Mexican American war was a conflict that sparked when the U S  annexed Texas in 1845 and the Mexican government refused to recognize the secession of Texas which was the precursor to the annexation  The war  which began in 1846 and lasted for two years  was settled via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which led to Mexico giving up even more of its land to the U S   including California  Mexico further transferred some of its territories  southern Arizona and New Mexico  to the U S  via the Gadsden Purchase in 1854   In the Reform War  that lasted from 1858 to 1861  the liberals led by Benito Juárez  were given the U S  recognition as the legitimate government in Mexico  Meanwhile  the conservatives  headed by Comonfort  Zuloaga and Miramón  brought a European Emperor to govern the country  Maximilian I  which led to the French Intervention in 1862  violating the Monroe Doctrine  there was nothing the U S  could do  as it was involved in its own civil war  Affecting Mexico s foreign policy  both sides  the Union and the Confederacy  were looking for international recognition as well  The Juárez administration was ideologically closer to the Union  but geographically Mexico shared a large border with the Confederacy  In 1861  the then U S  President Abraham Lincoln named Thomas Corwin as his minister for Mexico and instructed him to neutralize the Mexican aid given to the Confederates  he successfully achieved this mission  Once the civil war ended  then Secretary of State William Seward declared that the French invasion in Mexico was harmful to the friendship between France and the U S   and Washington provided financial aid to Benito Juárez  who successfully expelled the French in 1867   Lasting for seven years  the 1910 Mexican Revolution ended the rule of the dictator president Porfirio Díaz  The war was sparked when the U S  supported Díaz was proclaimed the winner of the 1910 elections despite mass popular support for his rival in the election Francisco I  Madero  After the war  the various groups that made up the revolutionary forces splintered as they lost the unifying goal of unseating Díaz —leading to a civil war  The U S  intervened in the conflict  including the involvement of the U S  ambassador  Henry Lane Wilson  in the plotting of the 1913 coup d état which overthrew Madero   The 1917 Constitution of Mexico caused several problems with the British and American transnational oil companies mainly derived from the article 27  which declares that  the wealth contained in the soil  the subsoil  the waters and seas of Mexico belongs to the Nation  the right to land ownership and to exploit the subsoil may therefore only be granted by the Nation   Due to foreign pressure  the implementation of the article was continuously ignored by the government until March 18  1938 when then President Lázaro Cárdenas nationalized the oil industry  PEMEX replaced the 17 Anglo American companies  however  the country faced hard retaliations from the transnational oil companies  as well as an international boycott that could be overcome ten years later   During the Cold War  demonstrating independence from the United States  Mexico supported the Cuban government during the 1960s  the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua during the late 1970s  and leftist revolutionary groups in El Salvador during the 1980s   The North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  went into effect on January 1  1994  which led to the elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers between Mexico and the U S  and serves as a multilateral platform for cooperation between both countries  The agreement increased trade volume and cooperation in both countries  The free trade agreement has been increasingly opposed by Mexican and U S  farmers  with many groups and the political left presenting that it hurts the interest of traditional  small and local farmers in both countries  Allegations of violations of labor and environmental laws have been considered by the trilateral institutions  The Bush Administration argued that NAFTA had had modest positive impacts on all three member countries  but Mexican farmers have strongly criticized the effects of the agreement as they have become overshadowed by the large corporations benefiting from NAFTA  Notable bilateral trade disputes relate to trucking  tuna  sweeteners and anti dumping measures   Migration  border security and trade issues have dominated the bilateral relationship in recent years  In September 2006  Congress approved the Secure Fence Act of 2006  P L  109 367  to authorize the construction of a border fence and other barriers along 700 miles of the U S  Mexico border  In March 2009  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton officially visited Mexico to discuss issues of concern for both countries  specifically the ones related to drug trafficking and U S  financial support in the Mexican drug war  Another persistent and growing problem is the international parental kidnapping of children to Mexico by non custodial parents and family members  Mexico is the most common destination for parents that have abducted their children across international borders with the vast majority of those children coming from the United States   3 4  Americas  Mexico is an observer of several regional organizations such as the Union of South American Nations  UNASUR   the Southern Common Market  Mercosur  and the Andean Community of Nations  CAN   Former President of Argentina Néstor Kirchner expressed  during a state visit in Mexico City  that Mexico should become a full member of Mercosur  other Latin American leaders such as Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Tabaré Vázquez share this vision and have extended the invitation  the latter emphasized Mexico s key role in integration of Latin America and the Caribbean and stated that   3 5  Africa  3 6  Asia  3 7  Europe  Mexico was the first Latin American country to sign a partnership agreement with the European Union  EU   in 1997  composed by 15 members at the time  The agreement entered into force in July 2000 and has considerably strengthened bilateral relations between the two partners  It governs all relations between them  including a regular high level political dialogue  and shared values such as democracy and human rights   3 8  Oceania  4  Multilateral relations  4 1  United Nations  Mexico is the tenth largest contributor to the United Nations  UN  regular budgets  Currently  it is a member of eighteen organizations arisen from the General Assembly  Economic and Social Council and other specialized organizations of the UN  Mexico has served as a non permanent member of the United Nations Security Council  UNSC  three times  1946  1982–83  2002–03   On October 17  2008  picking up 185 votes  it was elected to serve as a non permanent member for the fourth time  from January 1  2009 to December 31  2010  Since April 1  Mexico holds the rotative presidency of the UNSC   In recent years  the need of reforming the UNSC and its working methods has been widely impulsed by Mexico  with the support of Canada  Italy  Pakistan and other nine countries  And have formed a movement informally called the Coffee Club  created in the 1990s  which highly opposes to the reform that the Group of Four  G4  suggests   In line with the Castañeda Doctrine of new openness in Mexico s foreign policy  established in the early first decade of the 21st century  some political parties have proposed an amendment of the Constitution in order to allow the Mexican army  air force or navy to collaborate with the UN in peacekeeping missions   4 2  Organization of American States  As a founding member of the Organization of American States  OAS   Mexico has actively participated in the intergovernmental organization  Since the creation of the OAS  Mexico always promoted to include more principals related to international cooperation and less military aspects  its position was based on the principles of non intervention and the pacific resolution of disputes  In addition  Mexico favored the membership of Canada in 1989 and Belize and Guatemala in 1991   In 1964  under U S  pressure  the OAS required all member countries to break off diplomatic ties with Cuba  Mexico refused  condemned the Bay of Pigs invasion  and did not support the expulsion of Cuba from the OAS  Years later  Mexico strongly opposed to the creation of a military alliance within the OAS framework  and condemned the U S  invasion of Panama in 1989  Under the Fox administration  the candidacy of then Secretary of Foreign Affairs Luis Ernesto Derbez for the Secretary General of the OAS was highly promoted  It eventually failed but brought a diplomatic crisis with Chile and harsh critics from the Mexican public opinion when Derbez had announced that he would no longer compete against José Miguel Insulza but the Mexican delegation abstained despite being previously agreed that it would vote for the Chilean candidate   4 3  Mega Diverse Countries  The megadiverse countries are a group of countries that harbor the majority of the Earth s species and are therefore considered extremely biodiverse and therefore are of utmost priority on the global environmental agenda  Conservation International identified 17 megadiverse countries in 1998  most are located in or have territories in the tropics   In 2002  Mexico formed a separate organization named Like Minded Megadiverse Countries  consisting of countries rich in biological diversity and associated traditional knowledge  This organization includes a different set of involved megadiverse countries than those identified by Conservation International   4 4  Participation in international organizations  Regional Organizations

Methamphetamine and cannabis production do take place in Mexico and are responsible for an estimated 80% of the methamphetamine on the streets in the United States  while 1 100 metric tons of marijuana are smuggled each year from Mexico   In 1990 just over half the cocaine imported into the U S  came through Mexico  by 2007 that had risen to more than 90 percent  according to U S  State Department estimates  Although violence between drug cartels has been occurring long before the war began  the government used its police forces in the 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century with little effect  That changed on December 11  2006  when newly elected President Felipe Calderón sent 6 500 federal troops to the state of Michoacán to put an end to drug violence there  This action is regarded as the first major retaliation made against cartel operations  and is generally viewed as the starting point of the war between the government and the drug cartels  As time progressed  Calderón continued to escalate his anti drug campaign  in which there are now well over 25 000 troops involved  During the Calderón administration  the Mexican government has spent approximately US$7 billion in an 18 month old campaign against drug cartels  It is estimated that during 2006  there were about 2 000 drug related violent deaths  about 2 300 deaths during 2007  and more than 6 200 people by the end of 2008  Many of the dead were gang members killed by rivals or by the government  some have been bystanders   Drug trafficking is acknowledged as an issue with shared responsibilities that requires coordinated measures by the U S  and Mexico  In March 2009  United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton  when officially visited Mexico City  stated that   6 2  Illegal migration  Almost a third of all immigrants in the U S  were born in Mexico  being the source of the greatest number of both authorized  20%  and unauthorized  56%  migrants who come to the U S  every year  Since the early 1990s  Mexican immigrants are no longer concentrated in California  the Southwest  and Illinois  but have been coming to new gateway states  including New York  North Carolina  Georgia  Nevada  and Washington  D C   in increasing numbers  This phenomenon can be mainly attributed to poverty in Mexico  the growing demand for unskilled labor in the U S   the existence of established family and community networks that allow migrants to arrive in the U S  with people known to them   The framework of U S  immigration law has largely remained the same since 1965  The U S  economy needs both high skilled and low skilled immigrant workers to remain competitive and to have enough workers who continue to pay into Social Security and Medicare as the U S  population grows older  Nonetheless  there are currently very few channels for immigration to the U S  for work related reasons under current law  Furthermore  Amnesty International has taken concern regarding the excessive brutality inflicted upon illegal immigrants  which includes beatings  sexual assault  denial of medical attention  and denial of food  water and warmth for long periods   For many years  the Mexican government showed limited interest in the issues  However  former President Vicente Fox actively sought to recognize the contribution of migrants to the U S  and Mexico and to pursue a bilateral migration agreement with the U S  government  which eventually failed  The current administration has placed an emphasis on how to create jobs in Mexico  enhance border security  and protect Mexican citizens living abroad   Traditionally  Mexico built a reputation as one of the classic asylum countries  with a varying attitude toward refugees from Spain and other European countries before and during World War II  from Latin America s Southern Cone in the 1970s  and from Central America since the beginning of the 1980s  However  in recent years refugees who solicit asylum are usually treated as if they were just immigrants  with exhaustive administrative processes  The southern border of Mexico has experienced a significant increase in legal and illegal flows over the past decade  in particular for migrants seeking to transit Mexico to reach the U S  José Luis Soberanes  president of the National Human Rights Commission  condemned the repressing policy implemented by the Mexican government against illegal immigrants who cross the country s southern border  President Calderón modified the  General Law on Population  to derogate some penalties against immigrants such as jail  instead undocumented immigrants have to pay fines as high as US$500   7  See also  Diplomacy  List of diplomatic missions in Mexico  List of diplomatic missions of Mexico
