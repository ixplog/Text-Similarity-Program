Thomas the Apostle   called Didymus which means  the twin    was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ  according to the New Testament  He is informally called doubting Thomas because he doubted Jesus  resurrection when first told   in the Gospel of John   followed later by his confession of faith   My Lord and my God   on seeing Jesus  wounded body   Traditionally  he is said to have traveled outside the Roman Empire to preach the Gospel  traveling as far as India  According to tradition  the Apostle reached Muziris  India in AD 52 and baptized several people who are today known as Saint Thomas Christians or Nasranis  After his death  the reputed relics of Saint Thomas the Apostle were enshrined as far as Mesopotamia in the 3rd century  and later moved to various places  In 1258  some of the relics were brought to Abruzzo in Ortona  Italy  where they have been held in the Church of Saint Thomas the Apostle  He is often regarded as the Patron Saint of India  and the name Thoma remains quite popular among Saint Thomas Christians of India   1  Gospel of John  Thomas first speaks in the Gospel of John  In   when Lazarus had recently died  the apostles do not wish to go back to Judea  where Jews had attempted to stone Jesus  Thomas says   Let us also go  that we may die with him   NIV    He speaks again in   There  Jesus had just explained that he was going away to prepare a heavenly home for his followers  and that one day they would join him there  Thomas reacted by saying   Lord  we don’t know where you are going  so how can we know the way    NIV   tells how doubting Thomas was skeptical at first when he heard that Jesus had risen from the dead and appeared to the other apostles  saying   Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails  and put my finger into the print of the nails  and thrust my hand into his side  I will not believe    v 25  But when Jesus appeared later and invited Thomas to touch his wounds and behold him  Thomas showed his belief by saying   My Lord and my God    v 28  Jesus then said   Thomas  because thou hast seen me  thou hast believed  blessed  are  they that have not seen  and  yet  have believed    v 29   2  Names and etymologies  The name Thomas is derived from the Aramaic or Toma  meaning twin  The equivalent term for twin in Greek is Didymus   2 1  Other names  The Nag Hammadi copy of the Gospel of Thomas begins   These are the secret sayings that the living Jesus spoke and Didymos Judas Thomas recorded   Early Syrian traditions also relate the apostle s full name as Judas Thomas  Some have seen in the Acts of Thomas  written in east Syria in the early 3rd century  or perhaps as early as the first half of the 2nd century  an identification of Saint Thomas with the apostle Judas  brother of James  better known in English as Jude  However  the first sentence of the Acts follows the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles in distinguishing the apostle Thomas and the apostle Judas son of James  Few texts identify Thomas  twin  In the Book of Thomas the Contender  part of the Nag Hammadi  it is said to be Jesus himself   Now  since it has been said that you are my twin and true companion  examine yourself…   2 2  Feast days  When the feast of Saint Thomas was inserted in the Roman calendar in the 9th century  it was assigned to 21 December  The Martyrology of St  Jerome mentioned the apostle on 3 July  the date to which the Roman celebration was transferred in 1969  so that it would no longer interfere with the major ferial days of Advent  3 July was the day on which his relics were translated from Mylapore  a place along the coast of the Marina Beach  Chennai  Madras  in India  to the city of Edessa in Mesopotamia  Traditionalist Roman Catholics  who follow the General Roman Calendar of 1960 or earlier  and many Anglicans  including members of the Episcopal Church as well as members of the Church of England and the Lutheran Church  who worship according to the 1662 edition of the Book of Common Prayer   still celebrate his feast day on 21 December   The Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches celebrate his feast day on 6 October  for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar  6 October currently falls on 19 October of the modern Gregorian Calendar   In addition  the next Sunday of the Easter  Pascha  is celebrated as the Sunday of Thomas  in commemoration of Thomas  question to Jesus  which led him to proclaim  according to Orthodox teaching  two natures of Jesus  both human and divine  Thomas is commemorated in common with all of the other apostles on 30 June  13 July   in a feast called the Synaxis of the Holy Apostles  He is also associated with the  Arabian   or  Arapet   icon of the Theotokos  Mother of God   which is commemorated on 6 September  19 September   The Malankara Orthodox church celebrates his feast on three days  3 July  in memory of the relic translation to Edessa   18 December  the Day he was lanced  and 21 December  when he passed away   3  Later history and traditions  3 1  Assumption of Mary  According to The Passing of Mary  a text attributed to Joseph of Arimathea  Thomas was the only witness of the Assumption of Mary into heaven  The other apostles were miraculously transported to Jerusalem to witness her death  Thomas was left in India  but after her first burial  he was transported to her tomb  where he witnessed her bodily assumption into heaven  from which she dropped her girdle  In an inversion of the story of Thomas  doubts  the other apostles are skeptical of Thomas  story until they see the empty tomb and the girdle  Thomas  receipt of the girdle is commonly depicted in medieval and pre Tridentine Renaissance art  the apostle s infamous doubting reduced to a metaphorical knot in the Bavarian baroque Mary Untier of Knots   3 2  Mission in India  Thomas is traditionally believed to have sailed to India in AD 52 to spread the Christian faith among the Jews  some of whom had migrated to Kerala  He is supposed to have landed at the ancient port of Muziris  modern day North Paravur and Kodungalloor in Kerala state   The port was destroyed in 1341 due to a massive flood that realigned the coasts  He established Ezharappallikal or Seven and half churches in Kerala  These churches are at Kodungallur  Palayoor  Kottakkavu  Paravur   Kokkamangalam  Niranam  Nilackal  Chayal   Kollam and Thiruvithamcode  half church    It was to a land of dark people he was sent  to clothe them by Baptism in white robes  His grateful dawn dispelled India s painful darkness  It was his mission to espouse India to the One Begotten  The merchant is blessed for having so great a treasure  Edessa thus became the blessed city by possessing the greatest pearl India could yield  Thomas works miracles in India  and at Edessa Thomas is destined to baptize peoples perverse and steeped in darkness  and that in the land of India  Eusebius of Caesarea quotes Origen  died mid 3rd century  as having stated that Thomas was the apostle to the Parthians  but Thomas is better known as the missionary to India through the Acts of Thomas  perhaps written as late as c  200  In Edessa  where his remains were venerated  the poet St  Ephrem  died 373  wrote a hymn in which the Devil cries   I stirred up Death the Apostles to slay  that by their death I might escape their blows  But harder still am I now stricken  the Apostle I slew in India has overtaken me in Edessa  here and there he is all himself  There went I  and there was he  here and there to my grief I find him   St  Ephrem  a doctor of Syriac Christianity  writes in the forty second of his  Carmina Nisibina  that the Apostle was put to death in India  and that his remains were subsequently buried in Edessa  brought there by an unnamed merchant   A Syrian ecclesiastical calendar of an early date confirms the above and gives the merchant a name  The entry reads   3 July  St  Thomas who was pierced with a lance in  India   His body is in Urhai  Edessa  having been brought there by the merchant Khabin  A great festival    A long public tradition in Edessa honoring Thomas as the  Apostle of India  resulted in several surviving hymns  that are attributed to Ephrem  copied in codices of the 8th and 9th centuries  References in the hymns preserve the tradition that Thomas  bones were brought from India to Edessa by a merchant  and that the relics worked miracles both in India and Edessa  A pontiff assigned his feast day and a king and a queen erected his shrine  The Thomas traditions became embodied in Syriac liturgy  thus they were universally credited by the Christian community there  There is a legend that Thomas had met the biblical Magi on his way to India   According to Eusebius  record  Thomas and Bartholomew were assigned to Parthia and India  The Didascalia  dating from the end of the 3rd century  states  “India and all countries condering it  even to the farthest seas    received the apostolic ordinances from Judas Thomas  who was a guide and ruler in the church which he built ” Moreover  there is a wealth of confirmatory information in the Syriac writings  liturgical books  and calendars of the Church of the East  not to mention the writings of the Fathers  the calendars  the sacramentaries  and the martyrologies of the Roman  Greek and Ethiopian churches   An early 3rd century Syriac work known as the Acts of Thomas connects the apostle s Indian ministry with two kings  one in the north and the other in the south  According to one of the legends in the Acts  Thomas was at first reluctant to accept this mission  but the Lord appeared to him in a night vision and said   “Fear not  Thomas  Go away to India and proclaim the Word  for my grace shall be with you ” But the Apostle still demurred  so the Lord overruled the stubborn disciple by ordering circumstances so compelling that he was forced to accompany an  Indian  merchant  Abbanes  as a slave to his native place in northwest  India   where he found himself in the service of the Indo Parthian king  Gondophares  According to the Acts of Thomas  the apostle s ministry resulted in many conversions throughout the kingdom  including the king and his brother  Remains of some of his buildings  influenced by Greek architecture  indicate that he was a great builder  According to the legend  Thomas was a skilled carpenter and was bidden to build a palace for the king  However  the Apostle decided to teach the king a lesson by devoting the royal grant to acts of charity and thereby laying up treasure for the heavenly abode  Although little is known of the immediate growth of the church  Bar Daisan  154–223  reports that in his time there were Christian tribes in India which claimed to have been converted by Thomas and to have books and relics to prove it  But at least by the year of the establishment of the Second Persian Empire  226   there were bishops of the Church of the East in northwest India  Afghanistan and Baluchistan   with laymen and clergy alike engaging in missionary activity   The Acts of Thomas identifies his second mission in India with a kingdom ruled by King Vasudeva I  one of the rulers of a 1st century dynasty in southern India  It is most significant that  aside from a small remnant of the Church of the East in Kurdistan  the only other church to maintain a distinctive identity is the Saint Thomas Christian congregations along the Malabar Coast  modern day Kerala  in southwest India  According to the most ancient tradition of this church  Thomas evangelized this area and then crossed to the Coromandel Coast of southeast India  where  after carrying out a second mission  he died near Madras  Throughout the period under review  the church in India was under the jurisdiction of Edessa  which was then under the Mesopotamian patriarchate at Seleucia Ctesiphon and later at Baghdad and Mosul  Historian Vincent A  Smith says  “It must be admitted that a personal visit of the Apostle Thomas to South India was easily feasible in the traditional belief that he came by way of Socotra  where an ancient Christian settlement undoubtedly existed  I am now satisfied that the Christian church of South India is extremely ancient   ”   Thomas is believed to have left northwest India when invasion threatened and traveled by vessel to the Malabar coast  possibly visiting southeast Arabia and Socotra en route  and landing at the former flourishing port of Muziris  modern day North Paravur and Kodungalloor  near Cochin  c  51–52 AD  in the company of a Jewish merchant Abbanes  Hebban   From there he is said to have preached the gospel throughout the Malabar coast  The various churches he founded were located mainly on the Periyar River and its tributaries and along the coast  where there were Jewish colonies  He reputedly preached to all classes of people and had about 17 000 converts  including members of the four principal castes  Later  stone crosses were erected at the places where churches were founded  and they became pilgrimage centres  In accordance with apostolic custom  Thomas ordained teachers and leaders or elders  who were reported to be the earliest ministry of the Malabar Church   3 3  Death  According to tradition  St  Thomas was killed in 72 AD  Nasrani Churches from Kerala in South India state that St  Thomas died at Mylapore near Chennai in India and his body was interred there  The accounts of Marco Polo from the 13th century state that the Apostle had an accidental death outside his hermitage in Chennai by a badly aimed arrow of a fowler who not seeing the saint shot at peacocks there  Later in the 16th century  the Portuguese in India created a myth that St  Thomas was killed in Chennai by stoning and lance thrust by local priests  based on the wrong interpretation of inscriptions found on the Pehlvi Cross discovered at St  Thomas Mount in 1547  Later decipherments of the inscriptions by experts proved this myth to be false  Since at least the 16th century  the St  Thomas Mount has been a common site revered by Hindus  Muslims and Christians  The records of Barbosa from early 16th century inform that the tomb was then maintained by a Muslim who kept a lamp burning there  The San Thome Basilica presently located at the tomb was first built in the 16th century and rebuilt in the 19th   The Patristic literature states that St  Thomas died a martyr  in east of Persia  by the wounds of the four spears pierced into his body by the local soldiers  Some authorities state that St  Thomas died a natural death and that he died in Edessa   3 4  Relics  3 4 1  Mylapore  Few relics are still kept in the church at Mylapore  Tamil Nadu  India  Marco Polo  the Venetian traveller and author of Description of the World  popularly known as Il Milione  is reputed to have visited Southern India in 1288 and 1292  The first date has been rejected as he was in China at the time  but the second date is accepted by many historians  He is believed to have stopped in Ceylon  Sri Lanka   where he documented the tomb of Adam  He also stopped at Quilon  Kollam  on the western Malabar coast of India  where he met Syrian Christians and recorded their tradition of St  Thomas and his tomb on the eastern Coromandel coast of the country  Il Milione  the book he dictated on his return to Europe  was on its publication condemned by the Church as a collection of impious and improbable traveller s tales  It became very popular reading in medieval Europe and inspired Spanish and Portuguese sailors to seek out the fabulous  and possibly Christian  India described in it   3 4 2  Edessa  According to tradition  in 232 AD  the greater portion of relics of the Apostle Thomas are said to have been sent by an Indian king and brought from India to the city of Edessa  Mesopotamia  on which occasion his Syriac Acts were written   The Indian king is named as  Mazdai  in Syriac sources   Misdeos  and  Misdeus  in Greek and Latin sources respectively  which has been connected to the  Bazdeo  on the Kushan coinage of Vasudeva I  the transition between  M  and  B  being a current one in Classical sources for Indian names  The martyrologist Rabban Sliba dedicated a special day to both the Indian king  his family  and St Thomas   In the 4th century  the martyrium erected over his burial place brought pilgrims to Edessa  In the 380s  Egeria described her visit in a letter she sent to her community of nuns at home  Itineraria Egeriae    we arrived at Edessa in the Name of Christ our God  and  on our arrival  we straightway repaired to the church and memorial of saint Thomas  There  according to custom  prayers were made and the other things that were customary in the holy places were done  we read also some things concerning saint Thomas himself  The church there is very great  very beautiful and of new construction  well worthy to be the house of God  and as there was much that I desired to see  it was necessary for me to make a three days  stay there  In 441  the Magister militum per Orientem Anatolius donated a silver coffin to hold the relics   Coronatio Thomae apostoli et Misdeus rex Indiae  Johannes eus filius huisque mater Tertia   Coronation of Thomas the Apostle  and Misdeus king of India  together

traveller who mentions Syrian Christians in Malabar  in his book Christian Topography  He mentions that in the town of  Kalliana   Quilon or Kollam  there was a bishop who had been consecrated in Persia  Historian Aprem Mooken writes   Most church historians  who doubt the tradition of the doubting Thomas in India  will admit there was a church in India in the middle of the sixth century when Cosmas Indicopleustes visited India    King Vira Raghavaa gave a copper plate recording a grant given to Iravi Korttan  a Christian of Kodungallur  Anglicised to  Cranganore    with the date estimated at around 744 AD  In AD 822 two Nestorian Persian Bishops  Mar Sabor and Mar Proth  came to Malabar to occupy their seats in Kollam and Kodungallur  to care for the local Syrian Christians  also known as St  Thomas Christians    In 1144  the city was conquered by the Zengids and the shrine destroyed   3 4 3  Chios and Ortona  After a short stay on the Greek island of Chios  on 6 September 1258 the relics were transported to the West  and now rest in Ortona  Abruzzo  Italy  However  the skull of Thomas is said to be at Monastery of Saint John the Theologian on the Greek island of Patmos   Image

Andrew Achaia  James Spain  Thomas India  John Asia   5  Writings  Let none read the gospel according to Thomas  for it is the work  not of one of the twelve apostles  but of one of Mani s three wicked disciples  In the first two centuries of the Christian era  a number of writings were circulated  It is unclear now why Thomas was seen as an authority for doctrine  although this belief is documented in Gnostic groups as early as the Pistis Sophia  In that Gnostic work  Mary Magdalene  one of the disciples  says   Now at this time  my Lord  hear  so that I speak openly  for thou hast said to us  He who has ears to hear  let him hear   Concerning the word which thou didst say to Philip   Thou and Thomas and Matthew are the three to whom it has been given… to write every word of the Kingdom of the Light  and to bear witness to them   hear now that I give the interpretation of these words  It is this which thy light power once prophesied through Moses   Through two and three witnesses everything will be established  The three witnesses are Philip and Thomas and Matthew  An early  non Gnostic tradition may lie behind this statement  which also emphasizes the primacy of the Gospel of Matthew in its Aramaic form  over the other canonical three   Besides the Acts of Thomas there was a widely circulated Infancy Gospel of Thomas probably written in the later 2nd century  and probably also in Syria  which relates the miraculous events and prodigies of Jesus  boyhood  This is the document which tells for the first time the familiar legend of the twelve sparrows which Jesus  at the age of five  fashioned from clay on the Sabbath day  which took wing and flew away  The earliest manuscript of this work is a 6th century one in Syriac  This gospel was first referred to by Irenaeus  Ron Cameron notes   In his citation  Irenaeus first quotes a non canonical story that circulated about the childhood of Jesus and then goes directly on to quote a passage from the infancy narrative of the Gospel of Luke     Since the Infancy Gospel of Thomas records both of these stories  in relative close proximity to one another  it is possible that the apocryphal writing cited by Irenaeus is  in fact  what is now known as the Infancy Gospel of Thomas  Because of the complexities of the manuscript tradition  however  there is no certainty as to when the stories of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas began to be written down    The best known in modern times of these documents is the  sayings  document that is being called the Gospel of Thomas  a noncanonical work whose date is disputed  The opening line claims it is the work of  Didymos Judas Thomas  – whose identity is unknown  This work was discovered in a Coptic translation in 1945 at the Egyptian village of Nag Hammadi  near the site of the monastery of Chenoboskion  Once the Coptic text was published  scholars recognized that an earlier Greek translation had been published from fragments of papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus in the 1890s   6  Saint Thomas Cross  In the 16th century work Jornada  Antonio Gouvea writes of ornate crosses known as Saint Thomas Crosses  It is also known as Nasrani Menorah or Mar Thoma Sliba  These crosses date from the 6th century and are found in a number of churches in Kerala  Mylapore and Goa  Jornada is the oldest known written document to refer to this type of cross as a St  Thomas Cross  Gouvea also writes about the veneration of the Cross at Cranganore  referring to the cross as  Cross of Christians   It is widely perceived as the symbol of Saint Thomas Christians   There are several interpretations of the Nasrani symbol  The interpretation based on Christian Jewish tradition assumes that its design was based on Jewish menorah  an ancient symbol of the Hebrews  which consists of seven branched lamp stand  candelabra   The interpretation based on local culture states that the Cross without the figure of Jesus and with flowery arms symbolizing  joyfulness  points to the resurrection theology of St  Paul  the Holy Spirit on the top represents the role of Holy Spirit in the resurrection of Jesus Christ  The lotus symbolizing Buddhism and the Cross over it shows that Christianity was established in the land of Buddha  The 3 steps indicate Calvary and the rivulets  channels of grace flowing from the Cross   7  See also  List of Patriarchs of the Church
