A web banner or banner ad is a form of advertising on the World Wide Web delivered by an ad server  This form of online advertising entails embedding an advertisement into a web page  It is intended to attract traffic to a website by linking to the website of the advertiser  In many cases  banners are delivered by a central ad server   When the advertiser scans their logfiles and detects that a web user has visited the advertiser s site from the content site by clicking on the banner ad  the advertiser sends the content provider some small amount of money  usually around five to ten US cents   This payback system is often how the content provider is able to pay for the Internet access to supply the content in the first place  Usually though  advertisers use ad networks to serve their advertisements  resulting in a revshare system and higher quality ad placement   Web banners function the same way as traditional advertisements are intended to function  notifying consumers of the product or service and presenting reasons why the consumer should choose the product in question  a fact first documented on HotWired in 1996 by researchers Rex Briggs and Nigel Hollis  Web banners differ in that the results for advertisement campaigns may be monitored real time and may be targeted to the viewer s interests  Behavior is often tracked through the use of a click tag   Many web surfers regard these advertisements as highly annoying because they distract from a web page s actual content or waste bandwidth  Newer web browsers often include options to disable pop ups or block images from selected websites  Another way of avoiding banners is to use a proxy server that blocks them  such as Privoxy  Web browsers may also have extensions available that block banners  for example Adblock Plus for Mozilla Firefox  or AdThwart for Google Chrome and ie7pro for Internet Explorer   1  History  The pioneer of online advertising was Prodigy  a company owned by IBM and Sears at the time  Prodigy used online advertising first to promote Sears products in the 1980s  and then other advertisers  including AOL  one of Prodigy s direct competitors  Prodigy was unable to capitalize on any of its first mover advantage in online advertising   The first clickable web ad  which later came to be known by the term  banner ad   was sold by Global Network Navigator  GNN  in 1993 to Heller  Ehrman  White  & McAuliffe  a now defunct law firm with a Silicon Valley office  GNN was the first commercially supported web publication and one of the very first commercial web sites ever   HotWired was the first web site to sell banner ads in large quantities to a wide range of major corporate advertisers  Andrew Anker was HotWired s first CEO  Rick Boyce  a former media buyer with San Francisco advertising agency Hal Riney & Partners  spearheaded the sales effort for the company  HotWired coined the term  banner ad  and was the first company to provide click through rate reports to its customers  The first web banner sold by HotWired was paid for by AT&T Corp  and was put online on October 27  1994  Another source also credits Hotwired and October 1994  but has Coors   Zima  campaign as the first web banner   In May 1994  Ken McCarthy mentored Boyce in his transition from traditional to online advertising and first introduced the concept of a clickable trackable ad  He stated that he believed that only a direct response model舒in which the return on investment of individual ads was measured舒would prove sustainable over the long run for online advertising  In spite of this prediction  banner ads were valued and sold based on the number of impressions they generated   The first central ad server was released in July 1995 by Focalink Communications  which enabled the management  targeting  and tracking of online ads  A local ad server quickly followed from NetGravity in January 1996  The technology innovation of the ad server  together with the sale of online ads on an impression basis  fueled a dramatic rise in the proliferation of web advertising and provided the economic foundation for the web industry from the period of 1994 to 2000   The new online advertising model that emerged in the early years of the 21st century  introduced by GoTo com  later Overture  then Yahoo  and mass marketed by Google s AdWords program   relies heavily on tracking ad response rather than impressions   2  Standard sizes  Ad sizes have been standardized to some extent by the IAB  Prior to the IAB standardization  banner ads appeared in over 250 different sizes  However  some websites and advertising networks  outside the Eurosphere or North America  may not use any or all of the IAB base ad sizes  The IAB ad sizes are    3  References  4  See also  Ad serving  Hero image  Hover ad  Internet marketing  Live banner  Pay per click  Pop up ad  View through rate  Web analytics  Web button
