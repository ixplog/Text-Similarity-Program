Saks Fifth Avenue is an American luxury department store chain owned by multinational corporation Hudson s Bay Company  which operates the flagship store and corporate headquarters in Midtown Manhattan  New York City  It competes with high end specialty stores in Manhattan  notably Bergdorf Goodman  Barneys New York and Bloomingdale s  It also competes with luxury retailers  Neiman Marcus  Nordstrom  as well as corporate cousin Lord & Taylor   1  History  Saks Fifth Avenue is the successor of a business founded by Andrew Saks in 1867 and incorporated in New York in 1902 as Saks & Company  Saks died in 1912  and in 1923 Saks & Co  merged with Gimbel Brothers  Inc   which was owned by a cousin of Horace Saks  Bernard Gimbel  operating as a separate autonomous subsidiary  On September 15  1924  Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel opened Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City  with a full block avenue frontage south of St Patrick s Cathedral  facing Rockefeller Center  The architects were Starrett & van Vleck  who developed a reticent  genteel Anglophile classicizing facade similar to their Gimbels Department Store  Pittsburgh  1914    When Bernard s brother  Adam Gimbel  became President of Saks Fifth Avenue in 1926 after Bernard s sudden passing  the company assumed national aspirations  opening its branch that year in Palm Beach  Florida  as a seasonal resort store  followed by a second resort store in Southampton  New York  in 1928  The first full line year round Saks store opened in Chicago  in 1929  followed by another resort store in Miami Beach  Florida  In 1938  Saks expanded to the West Coast  opening in Beverly Hills  California  By the end of the 1930s  Saks Fifth Avenue had a total of 10 stores  including resort locations such as Sun Valley  Idaho  Mount Stowe  and Newport  Rhode Island  More full line stores followed with Detroit  Michigan  in 1940 and Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  in 1949  In Downtown Pittsburgh  the company moved to its own freestanding location approximately one block from its former home on the fourth floor in the downtown Gimbel s flagship  The San Francisco location opened in 1952  More expansion followed from the 1960s through the 1990s including the Midwest  and the South  particularly in Texas   BATUS Inc  acquired Gimbel Bros   Inc  and its Saks Fifth Avenue subsidiary in 1973 as part of its diversification strategy  In 1990  BATUS sold Saks to Investcorp S A   which after investing in the company and weathering the early 1990s recession took Saks public in 1996 as Saks Holdings  Inc  In 1998  Proffitt s  Inc  the parent company of Proffitt s and other department stores  acquired Saks Holdings Inc  Upon completing the acquisition  Proffitt s  Inc  changed its name to Saks Inc   In 2005  vendors filed against Saks alleging unlawful chargebacks  The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  investigated the complaint and Saks settled with the SEC in 2007   In August 2007  the United States Postal Service began an experimental program selling the plus zip code extension to businesses  The first company to do so was Saks Fifth Avenue which received the zip code of 10022 SHOE  7463  for the eighth floor shoe department in its flagship Fifth Avenue store  Today  the New York flagship store accounts for a significant amount of the entire chain s annual revenue   Saks continued expanding its physical presence throughout much of the 1980s and 1990s  resulting in Saks being saddled with a number of underperforming locations  Since 2000  Saks has closed several locations  including White Plains  Garden City  and Southampton in New York  Minneapolis  San Diego  Portland  Oregon  and suburban Chicago locations  Since 2010 another 10 stores have closed or are scheduled to close  including Pittsburgh  despite local efforts to save it   Denver  Charleston  South Carolina  Stamford  Connecticut  Austin  Dallas Willow Bend and Orlando which will close in 2014  Additionally  the company closed its location in Tampa  operated since 1996  in April  2013 and its last Dallas location in June 2013 to implement the  strategy of employing our resources in our most productive locations    Despite scaling back its Saks Fifth Avenue presence  the company has expanded the number of Saks Off Fifth locations  a concept first introduced in 2000  In states where it continues to operate  the number of stores has remained constant or risen through the addition of Saks Off Fifth sites   On July 29  2013  the Hudson s Bay Company  HBC   owner of the competing chain Lord & Taylor  announced it would acquire Saks Fifth Avenue s parent company for US$2 9 billion  Plans call for up to seven Saks Fifth Avenues to open in major Canadian markets  using either existing Hudson s Bay locations or new construction  Expansion into Canada is expected to challenge Canadian Holt Renfrew chain and compete with Nordstrom s expansion into Canada  which began in Summer 2014 with the opening of a Nordstrom store in Calgary  In January 2014  HBC announced the first Saks store in Canada would occupy in its flagship Queen Street building in downtown Toronto  The store will open in autumn 2015 with a second Toronto area location in the Sherway Gardens shopping center opening in spring 2016  Earlier  the company announced it would convert its location in the Hudson s Bay Centre at Bloor and Yonge Streets to Saks Fifth Avenue to make it part of the upscale Yorkville shopping district   The regular price business may be undermined by a larger number of Saks Off Fifth to open  Some Saks Fifth Avenue stores in the United States may convert to Lord & Taylor stores as early as January 2014   On January 6  2014  Marigay McKee  previously Chief Merchant at Harrods  is president of Saks Fifth Avenue   2  International  The chain s strategy for international expansion focuses on underserved luxury markets  Its first international location  operated under license by

City  The company s second Saudi Arabia location opened in January 2009 in Jeddah but is now closed  and in Puerto Rico in Plaza Internacional   3  Gallery  File SaksFifthAvenue JPG Flagship store in
