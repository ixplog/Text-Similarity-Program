The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC  is an international environmental treaty  currently the only international climate policy venue with broad legitimacy  due in part to its virtually universal membership  negotiated at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  UNCED   informally known as the Earth Summit  held in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992  The objective of the treaty is to  stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system    The treaty itself set no binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and contains no enforcement mechanisms  In that sense  the treaty is considered legally non binding  Instead  the treaty provides a framework for negotiating specific international treaties  called  protocols   that may set binding limits on greenhouse gases   The UNFCCC was opened for signature on 9 May 1992  after an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee produced the text of the Framework Convention as a report following its meeting in New York from 30 April to 9 May 1992  It entered into force on 21 March 1994  As of March 2014  UNFCCC has 196 parties   The parties to the convention have met annually from 1995 in Conferences of the Parties  COP  to assess progress in dealing with climate change  In 1997  the Kyoto Protocol was concluded and established legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions  The 2010 Cancún agreements state that future global warming should be limited to below 2 0 °C  3 6 °F  relative to the pre industrial level  The 20th COP took place in Peru in 2014   One of the first tasks set by the UNFCCC was for signatory nations to establish national greenhouse gas inventories of greenhouse gas  GHG  emissions and removals  which were used to create the 1990 benchmark levels for accession of Annex I countries to the Kyoto Protocol and for the commitment of those countries to GHG reductions  Updated inventories must be regularly submitted by Annex I countries   The UNFCCC is also the name of the United Nations Secretariat charged with supporting the operation of the Convention  with offices in Haus Carstanjen  Bonn  Germany  From 2006 to 2010 the head of the secretariat was Yvo de Boer  On 17 May 2010  Christiana Figueres from Costa Rica succeeded de Boer  The Secretariat  augmented through the parallel efforts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  IPCC   aims to gain consensus through meetings and the discussion of various strategies   1  Treaty  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC  was opened for signature at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  UNCED  in Rio de Janeiro  known by its popular title  the Earth Summit   On 12 June 1992  154 nations signed the UNFCCC  that upon ratification committed signatories  governments to reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases with the goal of  preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with Earth s climate system   This commitment would require substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  see the later section   Stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations    Article 3 1  of the Convention states that Parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of  common but differentiated responsibilities   and that developed country Parties should  take the lead  in addressing climate change  Under Article 4  all Parties make general commitments to address climate change through  for example  climate change mitigation and adapting to the eventual impacts of climate change  Article 4 7  states   The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties  The Framework Convention specifies the aim of developed  Annex I  Parties stabilizing their greenhouse gas emissions  carbon dioxide and other anthropogenic greenhouse gases not regulated under the Montreal Protocol  at 1990 levels  by the year 2000   1 1  Later negotiations  1 1 1  Kyoto Protocol  After the signing of the UNFCCC treaty  Parties to the UNFCCC have met at conferences   Conferences of the Parties  – COPs  to discuss how to achieve the treaty s aims  At the 1st Conference of the Parties  COP 1   Parties decided that the aim of Annex I Parties stabilizing their emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 was  not adequate   and further discussions at later conferences led to the Kyoto Protocol  The Kyoto Protocol sets emissions targets for developed countries which are binding under international law   The Kyoto Protocol has had two commitment periods  the first of which lasts from 2005 2012  and the second 2012 2020  The US has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol  The Kyoto Protocol has been ratified by all the other Annex I Parties   All Annex I Parties  excluding the US  have participated in the 1st Kyoto commitment period  37 Annex I countries and the EU have agreed to second round Kyoto targets  These countries are Australia  all members of the European Union  Belarus  Croatia  Iceland  Kazakhstan  Norway  Switzerland  and Ukraine  Belarus  Kazakhstan and Ukraine have stated that they may withdraw from the Protocol or not put into legal force the Amendment with second round targets  Japan  New Zealand  and Russia have participated in Kyoto s first round but have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period  Other developed countries without second round targets are Canada  which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012  and the United States   As well as the Kyoto Protocol  parties to the Convention have agreed to further commitments  These include the Bali Action Plan  2007   the Copenhagen Accord  2009   the Cancún agreements  2010   and the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action  2012    1 1 2  Bali Action Plan  As part of the Bali Action Plan  adopted in 2007  all developed country Parties have agreed to  quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives  while ensuring the comparability of efforts among them  taking into account differences in their national circumstances   Developing country Parties agreed to   nationally  appropriate mitigation actions  NAMAs  context of sustainable development  supported and enabled by technology  financing and capacity building  in a measurable  reportable and verifiable manner   42 developed countries have submitted mitigation targets to the UNFCCC secretariat  as have 57 developing countries and the African Group  a group of countries within the UN    1 1 3  Copenhagen and Cancún  As part of the 2009 Copenhagen negotiations  a number of countries produced the Copenhagen Accord  The Accord states that global warming should be limited to below 2 0 °C  3 6 °F   This may be strengthened in 2015 with a target to limit warming to below 1 5 °C  The Accord does not specify what the baseline is for these temperature targets  e g   relative to pre industrial or 1990 temperatures   According to the UNFCCC  these targets are relative to pre industrial temperatures   114 countries have agreed to the Accord  The UNFCCC secretariat notes that  Some Parties       stated in their communications to the secretariat specific understandings on the nature of the Accord and related matters  based on which they have agreed to  the Accord    The Accord was not formally adopted by the Conference of the Parties  Instead  the COP  took note of the Copenhagen Accord    As part of the Accord  17 developed country Parties and the EU 27 have submitted mitigation targets  as have 45 developing country Parties  Some developing country Parties have noted the need for international support in their plans   Many aspects of the Copenhagen Accord were brought into the formal UNFCCC process as part of the Cancún agreements  The Cancún agreements were adopted by the COP in 2010  The agreement states that global warming should be limited to below 2 0 °C  3 6 °F  relative to the pre industrial level  This target may be strengthened  on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge  including in relation to a global average temperature rise of 1 5 °C    As part of the Cancún agreements  developed and developing countries have submitted mitigation plans to the UNFCCC  These plans are compiled with those made as part of the Bali Action Plan   1 1 4  Durban and Doha  In 2011  parties adopted the  Durban Platform for Enhanced Action   As part of the Durban Platform  parties have agreed to  develop a protocol  another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties   This new treaty is due to be adopted at the 21st COP  and implemented in 2020  The 21st COP is scheduled to held in 2015   At Durban and Doha  parties noted  with grave concern  that current efforts to hold global warming to below 2 or 1 5 °C relative to the pre industrial level appear inadequate   1 1 5  Development  At Berlin  Cancún  and Durban  the development needs of developing country parties were reiterated  For example  the Durban Platform reaffirms that         social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing country Parties  and that a low emission development strategy is central to sustainable development  and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs  1 2  Interpreting Article 2  The ultimate objective of the Framework Convention is to prevent  dangerous  anthropogenic  i e   human caused  interference of the climate system  As is stated in Article 2 of the Convention  this requires that GHG concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change  food production is not threatened  and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion   To stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations  global anthropogenic GHG emissions would need to peak then decline  see climate change mitigation   Lower stabilization levels would require emissions to peak and decline earlier compared to higher stabilization levels  The graph above shows projected changes in annual global GHG emissions  measured in CO2 equivalents  for various stabilization scenarios  The other two graphs show the associated changes in atmospheric GHG concentrations  in CO2 equivalents  and global mean temperature for these scenarios  Lower stabilization levels are associated with lower magnitudes of global warming compared to higher stabilization levels  There is uncertainty over how GHG concentrations and global temperatures will change in response to anthropogenic emissions  see climate change feedback and climate sensitivity   The graph opposite shows global temperature changes in the year 2100 for a range of emission scenarios  including uncertainty estimates     Dangerous anthropogenic interference  There are a range of views over what level of climate change is dangerous  Scientific analysis can provide information on the risks of climate change  but deciding which risks are dangerous requires value judgements   The global warming that has already occurred poses a risk to some human and natural systems  e g   coral reefs   Higher magnitudes of global warming will generally increase the risk of negative impacts  According to Field et al   2014   climate change risks are  considerable  with 1 to 2 °C of global warming  relative to pre industrial levels  4 °C warming would lead to significantly increased risks  with potential impacts including widespread loss of biodiversity and reduced global and regional food security   Climate change policies may lead to costs that are relevant to Article 2  For example  more stringent policies to control GHG emissions may reduce the risk of more severe climate change  but may also be more expensive to implement     Projections  There is considerable uncertainty over future changes in anthropogenic GHG emissions  atmospheric GHG concentrations  and associated climate change  Without mitigation policies  increased energy demand and extensive use of fossil fuels could lead to global warming  in 2100  of 3 7 to 4 8 °C relative to pre industrial levels  2 5 to 7 8 °C including climate uncertainty    To have a likely chance of limiting global warming  in 2100  to below 2 °C  GHG concentrations would need to be limited to around 450 ppm CO2 eq  The current trajectory of global emissions does not appear to be consistent with limiting global warming to below 1 5 or 2 °C   1 3  Precautionary principle  In decision making  the precautionary principle is considered when possibly dangerous  irreversible  or catastrophic events are identified  but scientific evaluation of the potential damage is not sufficiently certain  Toth et al   2001  pp  655–656   The precautionary principle implies an emphasis on the need to prevent such adverse effects   Uncertainty is associated with each link of the causal chain of climate change  For example  future GHG emissions are uncertain  as are climate change damages  However  following the precautionary principle  uncertainty is not a reason for inaction  and this is acknowledged in Article 3 3 of the UNFCCC  Toth et al   2001  p  656    2  Parties  As of 2014  the UNFCC has 196 parties including all United Nations member states  as well as Niue  Cook Islands and the European Union  In addition  the Holy See and Palestine are observer states   2 1  Classification of Parties and their commitments  Parties to the UNFCCC are classified as   Annex I  There are 43 Parties to the UNFCCC listed in Annex I of the Convention  including the European Union  These Parties are classified as industrialized  developed  countries and  economies in transition   EITs   The 14 EITs are the former centrally planned  Soviet  economies of Russia and Eastern Europe   Annex II  There are 24 Parties to the UNFCCC listed in Annex II of the Convention  including the European Union  These Parties are made up of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD   Annex II Parties are required to provide financial and technical support to the EITs and developing countries to assist them in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions  climate change mitigation  and manage the impacts of climate change  climate change adaptation    Annex B  Parties listed in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol are Annex I Parties with first  or second round Kyoto greenhouse gas emissions targets  see Kyoto Protocol for details   The first round targets apply over the years 2008–2012  As part of the 2012 Doha climate change talks  an amendment to Annex B was agreed upon containing with a list of Annex I Parties who have second round Kyoto targets  which apply from 2013–2020  The amendments have not entered into force   Least developed countries  LDCs   49 Parties are LDCs  and are given special status under the treaty in view of their limited capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change   Non Annex I  Parties to the UNFCCC not listed in Annex I of the Convention are mostly low income developing countries  Developing countries may volunteer to become Annex I countries when they are sufficiently developed   2 2  List of parties  2 3  Annex I countries  There are 43 Annex I Parties including the European Union  These countries are classified as industrialized countries and economies in transition  Of these  24 are Annex II Parties  including the European Union  and 14 are Economies in Transition   Australia  Austria  Belarus  Belgium  Bulgaria  Canada  Croatia  Cyprus  Czech Republic  Denmark  Estonia  EU  Finland  France  Germany  Greece  Hungary  Iceland  Ireland  Italy  Japan  Latvia  Liechtenstein  Lithuania  Luxembourg  Malta

Notes  3  Conferences of the Parties  The United Nations Climate Change Conference are yearly conferences held in the framework of the UNFCC  They serve as the formal meeting of the UNFCC Parties  Conferences of the Parties   COP  to assess progress in dealing with climate change  and beginning in the mid 1990s  to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to establish legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions  From 2005 the Conferences have also served as the Meetings of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol  MOP   Also parties to the Convention that are not parties to the Protocol can participate in Protocol related meetings as observers  The first conference was held in 1995 in Berlin  while the 2012 conference was held in Doha  On November 11–22  2013  it was held in Warsaw  Poland   4  Subsidiary bodies  A subsidiary body is a committee that assists the Conference of the parties  Subsidiary bodies includes   Permanents   The Subsidiary Board of Implementation  SBI  makes recommendations on policy and implementation issues to the COP and  if requested  to other bodies   The Subsidiary Board of Scientific and Technological Advice  SBSTA  serves as a link between information and assessments provided by expert sources  such as the IPCC  and the COP  which focuses on setting policy   Temporary   Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol  AWG KP   Ad Hoc Working Group on Long term Cooperative Action  AWG LCA   5  Secretariat  The work under the UNFCCC is facilitated by a secretariat in Bonn  Germany  which from July 2010 is headed by Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres   6  Commentaries and analysis  6 1  Criticisms of the UNFCCC Process  The overall umbrella and processes of the UNFCCC and the adopted Kyoto Protocol have been criticized by some as not having achieved its stated goals of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide  the primary culprit blamed for rising global temperatures of the 21st century   At a speech given at his alma mater  Todd Stern — the US Climate Change envoy — has expressed the challenges with the UNFCCC process as follows  “Climate change is not a conventional environmental issue   It implicates virtually every aspect of a state s economy  so it makes countries nervous about growth and development  This is an economic issue every bit as it is an environmental one ” He went on to explain that  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a multilateral body concerned with climate change and can be an inefficient system for enacting international policy  Because the framework system includes over 190 countries and because negotiations are governed by consensus  small groups of countries can often block progress   The failure to achieve meaningful progress and reach effective CO2 reducing policy treaties among the parties over the past eighteen years have driven some countries like the United States to never ratify the UNFCCC s largest body of work — the Kyoto Protocol  in large part because the treaty didn t cover developing countries who now include the largest CO2 emitters  However  this fails to consider the historical responsibility for climate change since industrialisation  which is a contentious issue in the talks  and the responsibility of emissions from consumption and importation of goods  It has also led Canada to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol out of a desire to not force its citizens to pay penalties that would result in wealth transfers out of Canada  Canada formally withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2011  Both the US and Canada are looking at Voluntary Emissions Reduction schemes that they can implement internally to curb carbon dioxide emissions outside the Kyoto Protocol   The perceived lack of progress has also led some countries to seek and focus on alternative high value activities like the creation of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short Lived Climate Pollutants which seeks to regulate short lived pollutants such as methane  black carbon and hydrofluorocarbons  HFCs  which together are believed to account for up to 1 3 of current global warming but whose regulation is not as fraught with wide economic impacts and opposition   In 2010  Japan stated that it will not sign up to a second Kyoto term  because it would impose restrictions on it not faced by its main economic competitors  China  India and Indonesia  A similar indication was given by the Prime Minister of New Zealand in November 2012  At the 2012 conference  last minute objections at the conference by Russia  Ukraine  Belarus and Kazakhstan were ignored by the governing officials  and they have indicated that they will likely withdraw or not ratify the treaty  These defections place additional pressures on the UNFCCC process that is seen by some as cumbersome and expensive  in the UK alone the climate change department has taken over 3 000 flights in two years at a cost of over ₤1 300 000  British Pounds    6 2  Benchmarking  Benchmarking is the setting of a policy target based on some frame of reference  An example of benchmarking is the UNFCCC s original target of Annex I Parties limiting their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000  Goldemberg et al   1996  commented on the economic implications of this target  Although the target applies equally to all Annex I Parties  the economic costs of meeting the target would likely vary between Parties  For example  countries with initially high levels of energy efficiency might find it more costly to meet the target than countries with lower levels of energy efficiency  From this perspective  the UNFCCC target could be viewed as inequitable  i e   unfair   Benchmarking has also been discussed in relation to the first round emissions targets specified in the Kyoto Protocol  see views on the Kyoto Protocol and Kyoto Protocol and government action
