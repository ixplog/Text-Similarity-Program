Ottoman lands were completely lost  and tyrants took control of the cities  His absolute rule started around 1632  when he took the authority and repressed all the tyrants  and he re established the supremacy of Sultan   1 1  Early reign  1623–32   Murad IV was for a long time under the control of his relatives and during his early years as Sultan  his mother  Kösem Sultan  essentially ruled through him  The Empire fell into anarchy  the Safavid Empire invaded Iraq almost immediately  Northern Anatolia erupted in revolts  and in 1631 the Janissaries stormed the palace and killed the Grand Vizier  among others  Murad IV feared suffering the fate of his elder brother  Osman II  1618舑22   and decided to assert his power   At the age of 16 in 1628  he had his brother in law  his sister Fatma Sultan s husband  and the former governor of Egypt Kara Mustafa Pasha executed for a claimed action  against the law of God    1 2  Absolute rule and imperial policies  1632–40   Murad IV tried to quell the corruption that had grown during the reigns of previous Sultans  and that had not been checked while his mother was ruling through proxy   Murad IV also banned alcohol  tobacco  and coffee in Constantinople  He ordered execution for breaking this ban  He would reportedly patrol the streets and taverns of Constantinople in civilian clothes at night  policing the enforcement of his command by summarily killing civilians for breaking this decree  He restored the judicial regulations by very strict punishments  including execution  Historians including Halil İnalcık as well as primary sources report that even though he was a ruthless supporter of alcohol prohibition  Murad IV was a habitual drinker himself   In a poem by the sultan under a nom de plume  he says  Even if the rivers became wine  they wouldn t fill my glass   In another poem he says  The wine is such a devil that I have to protect my people from it by drinking all of it    1 3  Relations with the Mughal Empire  In the year 1626  the Mughal Emperor Jahangir began to contemplate an alliance between the Ottomans  Mughals and Uzbeks against the Safavids  who had defeated the Mughals at Kandahar  He even wrote a letter to the Ottoman Sultan Murad IV  Jahangir s ambition however did not materialize due to his death in 1627  However  Jahangir s son and successor Shah Jahan pursued the goal of alliance with the Ottoman Empire   While he was encamped in Baghdad  Murad IV is known to have met the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan s ambassadors  Mir Zarif and Mir Baraka  who presented 1000 pieces of finely embroidered cloth and even armor  Murad IV gave them the finest weapons  saddles and Kaftans and ordered his forces to accompany the Mughals to the port of Basra  where they set sail to Thatta and finally Surat   2  Military campaigns  Militarily  Murad IV s reign is most notable for the war against Safavids in which Ottoman forces invaded Azerbaijan  occupied Revan  Tabriz and Hamadan  and recaptured Baghdad in 1638  The city withstood the siege for forty days  but was compelled to surrender  and the bulk of the population were butchered by the conquerors  in spite of the promises which they had made to spare them  It is said that the officers of Murad arranged a sort of tableau  in which the heads were struck off one thousand captives by one thousand headsmen at the same moment  and that Murad IV enjoyed the sight  The sultan had a famous quote about the fall of Baghdad    Trying to conquer Baghdad  was almost more beautiful than Baghdad itself      Murad IV himself commanded the Ottoman army in the last years of the war  and proved to be an outstanding field commander  He was the second Ottoman Sultan to command an army on the battlefield since death of Suleiman the Magnificent in 1566  During his campaign to Persia  he annihilated all rebels in Anatolia and restored order in the Empire   The war was concluded by the Treaty of Kasrı Şirin in May 1639  which restored Mesopotamia to the Ottomans  After his return to Constantinople  he ordered respected statesmen of the Empire to prepare a new economic and political project to return to the Empire the old successful days   3  Physical power  Murad IV was the last Warrior Sultan who led campaigns in front of his army and fought on the battlefield  His physical strength was phenomenal  which is described in detail on the books of Evliya Çelebi  He was especially known for his exceptional strength in wrestling   capable of fighting several opponents at the same time  His favorite weapon was a huge mace  which  according to legend  he wielded effortlessly with a single hand despite it reportedly weighed 60 kilograms  132 lbs   Among his other favorite weapons are a longbow and a large two handed broadsword apparently weighing more than 50 kilograms  110 lbs   despite the fact that even the largest known swords  used for combat  rarely weigh more than 10 lbs  and ceremonial parade swords weighing more than 15 lbs are exceedingly rare  His weapons are today displayed at the Topkapı Palace Museum in Fatih  intact and well preserved  citation needed    4  Architecture  Sultan Murad IV

the age of 27 in 1640   Rumours had circulated that on his deathbed  Murad IV ordered the execution of his mentally disabled brother  Ibrahim I  reigned 1640–48   which would have meant the end of the
