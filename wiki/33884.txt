The Woodstock Music & Art Fair—informally  the Woodstock Festival or simply Woodstock—was a music festival  billed as  An Aquarian Exposition  3 Days of Peace & Music   It was held at Max Yasgur s dairy farm in the Catskills near the hamlet of White Lake in the town of Bethel  New York  from August 15 to 18  1969  Bethel  in Sullivan County  is southwest of the town of Woodstock  New York  in adjoining Ulster County   During the sometimes rainy weekend  32 acts performed outdoors before an audience of 400 000 young people  It is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history  Rolling Stone listed it as one of the 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll   The festival is also widely considered to be the definitive nexus for the larger counterculture generation   The event was captured in the 1970 documentary movie Woodstock  an accompanying soundtrack album  and Joni Mitchell s song  Woodstock   which commemorated the event and became a major hit for Crosby  Stills  Nash & Young   1  Planning and preparation  Woodstock was initiated through the efforts of Michael Lang  John Roberts  Joel Rosenman  and Artie Kornfeld  Roberts and Rosenman financed the project  Lang had experience as a promoter and had already organized the largest festival on the East Coast at the time  the Miami Pop Festival  where an estimated 100 000 people attended the two day event  Roberts and Rosenman placed the following advertisement in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal under the name of Challenge International  Ltd    Young men with unlimited capital looking for interesting  legitimate investment opportunities and business propositions    Lang and Kornfeld noticed the ad  and the four got together originally to discuss a retreat like recording studio in Woodstock  The idea evolved into an outdoor music and arts festival  although even that was initially envisioned on a smaller scale  perhaps featuring some big name artists who lived in the Woodstock area  such as Bob Dylan and The Band   There were differences in approach among the four  Roberts was disciplined and knew what was needed for the venture to succeed  while the laid back Lang saw Woodstock as a new  relaxed way of bringing entrepreneurs together  There were further doubts over the venture  as Roberts wondered whether to consolidate his losses and pull the plug  or to continue pumping his own finances into the project   In 1969  the four Woodstock supporters  Roberts  Lang  Kornfeld  and Rosenman  formed Woodstock Ventures in an oddly decorated office located at 47 West 57th Street in Manhattan  Michael Lang oversaw the psychedelic transformation of the office done by Curtain Call Productions  Inc   In April 1969  newly minted superstars Creedence Clearwater Revival became the first act to sign a contract for the event  agreeing to play for $10 000  The promoters had experienced difficulty landing big name groups prior to Creedence committing to play  Creedence drummer Doug Clifford later commented   Once Creedence signed  everyone else jumped in line and all the other big acts came on   Given their 3 00 a m  start time and omission  at frontman John Fogerty s insistence  from the Woodstock film  members have expressed bitterness over their experiences at the famed festival   Woodstock was designed as a profit making venture  aptly titled  Woodstock Ventures   It famously became a  free concert  only after the event drew hundreds of thousands more patrons than the organizers had prepared for  Tickets for the three day event cost $18 in advance and $24 at the gate  equivalent to $ and $ in 2014   Ticket sales were limited to record stores in the greater New York City area  or by mail via a post office box at the Radio City Station Post Office located in Midtown Manhattan  Around 186 000 advance tickets were sold  and the organizers anticipated approximately 200 000 festival goers would turn up   1 1  Selection of the venue  The original venue plan was for the festival to take place in Woodstock  New York at a site owned by Alexander Tapooz  After local residents quickly shot down that idea  Lang and Kornfeld found another location in Saugerties  New York  The landowner agreed to lease the property  but when Roberts and Rosenman met with his attorney  he expressed concern over the financial security of Woodstock Ventures and decided to repeal his offer  The group got closer to a venue when they discovered the Mills Industrial Park    in the town of Wallkill  New York  which Woodstock Ventures had leased for $10 000 in the Spring of 1969  Town officials were assured that no more than 50 000 would attend  Town residents immediately opposed the project  In early July  the Town Board passed a law requiring a permit for any gathering over 5 000 people  On July 15  1969  the Wallkill Zoning Board of Appeals officially banned the concert on the basis that the planned portable toilets would not meet town code  Reports of the ban  however  turned out to be a publicity bonanza for the festival  In his 2007 book Taking Woodstock  Elliot Tiber relates that he offered to host the event on his motel grounds  and had a permit for such an event  He claims to have introduced the promoters to dairy farmer Max Yasgur  Lang  however  disputes Tiber s account and says that Tiber introduced him to a realtor  who drove him to Yasgur s farm without Tiber  Sam Yasgur  Max s son  agrees with Lang s account  Yasgur s land formed a natural bowl sloping down to Filippini Pond on the land s north side  The stage would be set up at the bottom of the hill with Filippini Pond forming a backdrop  The pond would become a popular skinny dipping destination   The organizers once again told Bethel authorities they expected no more than 50 000 people   Despite resident opposition and signs proclaiming   Buy No Milk  Stop Max s Hippy Music Festival   Bethel Town Attorney Frederick W  V  Schadt and building inspector Donald Clark approved the permits  but the Bethel Town Board refused to issue them formally  Clark was ordered to post stop work orders   1 2  Free concert  The late change in venue did not give the festival organizers enough time to prepare  At a meeting three days before the event  organizers felt they had two choices  One option was to improve the fencing and security  which might have resulted in violence  the other involved putting all their resources into completing the stage  which would cause Woodstock Ventures to take a financial hit  The crowd  which was arriving in greater numbers and earlier than anticipated  made the decision for them  The fence was cut the night before the concert   2  The festival  The influx of attendees to the rural concert site in Bethel created a massive traffic jam  Fearing chaos as thousands began descending on the community  Bethel did not enforce its codes  Eventually  announcements on radio stations as far away as WNEW FM in Manhattan and descriptions of the traffic jams on television news discouraged people from setting off to the festival  Arlo Guthrie made an announcement that was included in the film saying that the New York State Thruway was closed  The director of the Woodstock museum discussed below said this never occurred  To add to the problems and difficulty in dealing with the large crowds  recent rains had caused muddy roads and fields  The facilities were not equipped to provide sanitation or first aid for the number of people attending  hundreds of thousands found themselves in a struggle against bad weather  food shortages  and poor sanitation   On the morning of Sunday  August 17  New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller called festival organizer John Roberts and told him he was thinking of ordering 10 000 New York State National Guard troops to the festival  Roberts was successful in persuading Rockefeller not to do this  Sullivan County declared a state of emergency  During the festival  personnel from nearby Stewart Air Force Base assisted in helping to ensure order and airlifting performers in and out of the concert venue   Jimi Hendrix was the last act to perform at the festival  Because of the rain delays that Sunday  when Hendrix finally took the stage it was 8 30 Monday morning  The audience  which had peaked at an estimated 400 000 during the festival  was now reduced to about 30 000 by that point  many of them merely waited to catch a glimpse of Hendrix before leaving during his performance   Hendrix and his new band  Gypsy  Sun and Rainbows  Introduced as The Experience  but corrected by Jimi  performed a two hour set  His psychedelic rendition of the U S  national anthem   The Star Spangled Banner  occurred about into their set  after which he segued into  Purple Haze    The song would become  part of the sixties Zeitgeist  as it was captured forever in the Woodstock film  Hendrix s image performing this number wearing a blue beaded white leather jacket with fringe and a red head scarf  has since been regarded as a defining moment of the 1960s   Although the festival was remarkably peaceful given the number of people and the conditions involved  there were two recorded fatalities  one from what was believed to be a heroin overdose  and another caused in an accident when a tractor ran over an attendee sleeping in a nearby hayfield  There also were two births recorded at the event  one in a car caught in traffic and another in a hospital after an airlift by helicopter  and four miscarriages  Oral testimony in the film supports the overdose and run over deaths and at least one birth  along with many logistical headaches   Yet  in tune with the idealistic hopes of the 1960s  Woodstock satisfied most attendees  There was a sense of social harmony  which  with the quality of music  and the overwhelming mass of people  many sporting bohemian dress  behavior  and attitudes helped to make it one of the enduring events of the century   After the concert  Max Yasgur  who owned the site of the event  saw it as a victory of peace and love  He spoke of how nearly half a million people filled with potential for disaster  riot  looting  and catastrophe spent the three days with music and peace on their minds  He stated   If we join them  we can turn those adversities that are the problems of America today into a hope for a brighter and more peaceful future      2 1  Sound  Sound for the concert was engineered by sound engineer Bill Hanley   It worked very well   he says of the event   I built special speaker columns on the hills and had 16 loudspeaker arrays in a square platform going up to the hill on towers  We set it up for 150 000 to 200 000 people  Of course  500 000 showed up   ALTEC designed marine plywood cabinets that weighed half a ton apiece and stood tall  almost deep  and wide  Each of these enclosures carried four JBL D140 loudspeakers  The tweeters consisted of 4×2 Cell & 2×10 Cell Altec Horns  Behind the stage were three transformers providing 2 000 amperes of current to power the amplification setup  For many years this system was collectively referred to as the Woodstock Bins   2 2  Performing artists  Thirty two acts performed over the course of the four days      2 3  Declined invitations and missed connections  Bob Dylan  in whose  backyard  the festival was held  was never in serious negotiation  Instead  Dylan signed in mid July to play the Isle of Wight Festival of Music  on August 31  Dylan set sail for England on on August 15  the day the Woodstock Festival started  His son was injured by a cabin door and the family disembarked  Dylan  with his wife Sara  flew to England the following week  Dylan had been unhappy about the number of hippies piling up outside his house in the nearby town of Woodstock   The Beatles John Lennon  There are two scenarios as to why The Beatles did not perform  The first is that promoters contacted John Lennon to discuss a Beatles performance at Woodstock  and Lennon said that the Beatles would not play unless there was also a spot at the festival for Yoko Ono s Plastic Ono Band  whereupon he was turned down  The website claims the more likely explanation is that Lennon wanted to play but his entry into the United States from Canada was blocked by President Richard Nixon  The Beatles were  in any case  on the verge of disbanding  Also  they had not performed any live concerts since August 1966  three full years before the festival  not including their impromptu rooftop concert given on January 30  1969 a few months before    The Jeff Beck Group  Jeff Beck disbanded the group prior to Woodstock   I deliberately broke the group up before Woodstock   Beck said   I didn t want it to be preserved   Interestingly  it was to have been the first time that Beck would perform with Tim Bogert and Carmine Appice  Also  Beck s piano player Nicky Hopkins performed with Jefferson Airplane   The Doors were considered as a potential performing band but canceled at the last moment  According to guitarist Robby Krieger  they turned it down because they thought it would be a  second class repeat of Monterey Pop Festival  and later regretted that decision   Led Zeppelin was asked to perform  their manager Peter Grant stated   We were asked to do Woodstock and Atlantic were very keen  and so was our U S  promoter  Frank Barsalona  I said no because at Woodstock we d have just been another band on the bill   However  the group did play the first Atlanta International Pop Festival on July 5  as one of 22 bands at the two day event  Woodstock weekend  Zeppelin performed south of the festival at the Asbury Park Convention Hall in New Jersey  Their only time out taken was to attend Elvis Presley s show at the International Hotel in Las Vegas  on August 12   The Byrds were invited  but chose not to participate  figuring Woodstock to be no different from any of the other music festivals that summer  There were also concerns about money  As bassist John York remembers   We were flying to a gig and Roger  McGuinn  came up to us and said that a guy was putting on a festival in upstate New York  But at that point they weren t paying all of the bands  He asked us if we wanted to do it and we said   No   We had no idea what it was going to be  We were burned out and tired of the festival scene        So all of us said   No  we want a rest  and missed the best festival of all    Chicago  at the time still known as the Chicago Transit Authority  had initially been signed on to play at Woodstock  However  they had a contract with concert promoter Bill Graham  which allowed him to move Chicago s concerts at the Fillmore West  He rescheduled some of their dates to August 17  thus forcing the band to back out of the concert  Graham did so to ensure that Santana  which he managed at the time  would take their slot at the festival  According to singer and bassist Peter Cetera   We were sort of peeved at him for pulling that one    Tommy James and the Shondells declined an invitation  Lead singer Tommy James stated later   We could have just kicked ourselves  We were in Hawaii  and my secretary called and said   Yeah  listen  there s this pig farmer in upstate New York that wants you to play in his field   That s how it was put to me  So we passed  and we realized what we d missed a couple of days later    The Moody Blues were included on the original Wallkill poster as performers  but decided to back out after being booked in Paris the same weekend   Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention  according to the Class of the 20th Century U S  television special  is quoted as saying  A lot of mud at Woodstock     We were invited to play there  we turned it down    Arthur Lee and Love declined the invitation  but Mojo Magazine later described inner turmoil within the band which caused their absence at the Woodstock festival   Free was asked to perform and declined   Mind Garage declined because they thought the festival would be no huge deal and they had a higher paying gig elsewhere   Spirit also declined an invitation to play  as they already had shows planned and wanted to play those instead  not knowing how big Woodstock would be   Joni Mitchell was originally slated to perform  but canceled at the urging of her manager to avoid missing a scheduled appearance on The Dick Cavett Show   Lighthouse declined to perform at Woodstock   Roy Rogers was asked by Lang to close the festival with Happy Trails but he declined   Procol Harum was invited but refused because Woodstock fell at the end of a long tour and also coincided with the due date of guitarist Robin Trower s baby   Jethro Tull also declined  According to frontman Ian Anderson  he knew it would be a big event but he did not want to go because he did not like hippies and other concerns including inappropriate nudity and the money being right   Iron Butterfly was booked to appear  and is listed on the Woodstock poster for a Sunday performance  but could not perform because they were stuck at an airport   Raven – attorney Miles Laurie  one of Michael Lang s lawyers set up a meeting with Raven manager  Marty Angelo and offered his band a spot on the lineup but only if they signed a contract with Lang to be Raven s record producer and 10% of future earnings  Raven turned down his offer based on the fact that the year before the band played at one of Woodstock s  Sound Outs  and the gig didn t go well  Lang assured them that his concert was going to be different  The band respectfully declined   2 4  Media coverage  Very few reporters from outside the immediate area were on the scene  During the first few days of the festival  national media coverage emphasized the problems  Front page headlines in the Daily News read  Traffic Uptight at Hippiefest  and  Hippies Mired in a Sea of Mud   Coverage became more positive by the end of the festival  in part because the parents of concertgoers called the media and told them  based on their children s phone calls  that their reporting was misleading   The New York Times covered the prelude to the festival and the move from Wallkill to Bethel  Barnard Collier  who reported from the event for The New York Times  asserts that he was pressured by on duty editors at the paper to write a misleadingly negative article about the event  According to Collier  this led to acrimonious discussions and his threat to refuse to write the article until the paper s executive editor  James Reston  agreed to let him write the article as he saw fit  The eventual article dealt with issues of traffic jams and minor lawbreaking  but went on to emphasize cooperation  generosity  and the good nature of the festival goers  When the festival was over  Collier wrote another article about the exodus of fans from the festival site and the lack of violence at the event  The chief medical officer for the event and several local residents were quoted as praising the festival goers   Middletown  New York s Times Herald Record  the only local daily newspaper  editorialized against the law that banned the festival from Wallkill  During the festival a rare Saturday edition was published  The paper had the only phone line running out of the site  and it used a motorcyclist to get stories and pictures from the impassable crowd to the newspaper s office away in Middletown   3  Releases  3 1  Films  The documentary film Woodstock  directed by Michael Wadleigh and edited by Thelma Schoonmaker and Martin Scorsese  was released in 1970  Artie Kornfeld  one of the promoters of the festival  came to Fred Weintraub  an executive at Warner Bros   and asked for money to film the festival  Previously  Artie had been turned down everywhere else  but against the express wishes of other Warner Bros  executives  Weintraub put his job on the line and gave Kornfeld $100 000 to make the film  Woodstock helped to save Warner Bros at a time when the company was on the verge of going out of business  The book Easy Riders  Raging Bulls details the making of the film   Wadleigh rounded up a crew of about 100 from the New York film scene  With no money to pay the crew  he agreed to a double or nothing scheme  in which the crew would receive double pay if the film succeeded and nothing if it bombed  Wadleigh strove to make the film as much about the hippies as the music  listening to their feelings about compelling events contemporaneous with the festival  such as the Vietnam War   as well as the views of the townspeople   Woodstock received the Academy Award for Documentary Feature  The film has been deemed culturally significant by the United States Library of Congress  In 1994  Woodstock  The Director s Cut was released and expanded to include Janis Joplin as well as additional performances by Jefferson Airplane  Jimi Hendrix  and Canned Heat not seen in the original version of the film  In 2009  the expanded 40th Anniversary Edition was released on DVD  This release marks the film s first availability on Blu ray disc   Another film on Woodstock named Taking Woodstock was produced in 2009 by Taiwanese American filmmaker Ang Lee  Lee practically rented out the entire town of New Lebanon  New York  to shoot the film  He was concerned with angering the locals  but they ended up being incredibly welcoming and excited to help with the film  The movie is based on Elliot Tiber  played by Demetri Martin  and his role in bringing Woodstock to Bethel  New York  The film also stars Jonathan Groff as Michael Lang and Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton as Jake and Sonia Teichberg   3 2  Albums  Two soundtrack albums were released  The first  Woodstock  Music from the Original Soundtrack and More  was a 3 LP  later 2 CD  album containing a sampling of one or two songs by most of the acts who performed  A year later  Woodstock 2 was released as a 2 LP album  Both albums included recordings of stage announcements  e g     We re told  that the brown acid is not specifically too good    Hey  if you think really hard  maybe we can stop this rain   and crowd noises  i e   the rain chant  between songs  In 1994  a third album  Woodstock Diary was released  Tracks from all three albums  as well as numerous additional  previously unreleased performances from the festival but not the stage announcements and crowd noises  were reissued by Atlantic as a 4 CD box set titled Woodstock  Three Days of Peace and Music   An album titled Jimi Hendrix  Woodstock also was released in 1994  featuring only selected recordings of Jimi Hendrix at the festival  A longer double disc set  Live at Woodstock  1999  features nearly every song of Hendrix s performance  omitting just two pieces that were sung by his rhythm guitarist   In 2009  Joe Cocker released a live album of his entire Woodstock set  The album contained eleven tracks  ten of which were previously unreleased   In 2009  complete performances from Woodstock by Santana  Janis Joplin  Sly & the Family Stone  Jefferson Airplane  and Johnny Winter were released separately by Legacy SME Records  and were also collected in a box set titled The Woodstock Experience  Also  in 2009  Rhino Atlantic Records issued a 6 CD box set titled Woodstock  40 Years On  Back to Yasgur s Farm  which included further musical performances as well as stage announcements and other ancillary material   4  Aftermath  Max Yasgur refused to rent out his farm for a 1970 revival of the festival  saying   As far as I know  I m going back to running a dairy farm   Yasgur died in 1973   Bethel voters tossed out their supervisor in an election held in November 1969 because of his role in bringing the festival to the town  New York State and the town of Bethel passed mass gathering laws designed to prevent any more festivals from occurring   In 1984  at the original festival site  land owners Louis Nicky and June Gelish put up a monument marker with plaques called  Peace and Music  by a local sculptor from nearby Bloomingburg  Wayne C  Saward  1957–2009    Attempts were made to prevent people from visiting the site  its owners spread chicken manure  and during one anniversary tractors and state police cars formed roadblocks  Twenty thousand people gathered at the site in 1989 during an impromptu 20th anniversary celebration  In 1997 a community group put up a welcoming sign for visitors  Unlike Bethel  the town of Woodstock made several efforts to cash in on its notoriety  Bethel s stance changed in recent years  and the town now embraces the festival  Efforts have begun to forge a link between Bethel and Woodstock   Approximately 80 lawsuits were filed against Woodstock Ventures  The movie financed settlements and paid off the $1 4 million of debt Woodstock Ventures had incurred from the festival   5  Legacy  5 1  Woodstock site today  In 1984 a plaque was placed at the original site commemorating the festival  The field and the stage area remain preserved in their rural setting  A concert hall was erected up on the hill in 2009  and the fields of the Yasgur farm are still visited by people of all generations   In 1996  the site of the concert and surrounding was purchased by cable television pioneer Alan Gerry for the purpose of creating the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts  The Center opened on July 1  2006  with a performance of the New York Philharmonic  On August 13  2006  Crosby  Stills  Nash & Young performed before 16 000 fans at the new Center—37 years after their historic performance at Woodstock   The Museum at Bethel Woods opened on June 2  2008  The Museum contains film and interactive displays  text panels  and artifacts that explore the unique experience of the Woodstock festival  its significance as the culminating event of a decade of radical cultural transformation  and the legacy of the Sixties and Woodstock today   The ashes of the late Richie Havens were scattered across the site on August 18  2013   5 2  Woodstock 40th anniversary  There was worldwide media interest in the 40th anniversary of Woodstock in 2009  A number of activities to commemorate the festival took place around the world  On August 15  at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts overlooking the original site  the largest assembly of Woodstock performing alumni since the original 1969 festival performed in an eight hour concert in front of a sold out crowd  Hosted by Country Joe McDonald  the concert featured Big Brother and the Holding Company performing Janis Joplin s hits  she actually appeared with the Kozmic Blues Band at Woodstock  although that band did feature former Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew   Canned Heat  Ten Years After  Jefferson Starship  Mountain  and the headliners  The Levon Helm Band  At Woodstock  Levon Helm played drums and was one of the lead vocalists with The Band  Paul Kantner was the only member of the 1969 Jefferson Airplane line up to appear with Jefferson Starship  Tom Constanten  who played keyboard with the Grateful Dead at Woodstock  joined Jefferson Starship on stage for several numbers  Jocko Marcellino from Sha Na Na also appeared  backed up by Canned Heat  Richie Havens  who opened the Woodstock festival in 1969  appeared at a separate event the previous night  Crosby  Stills & Nash and Arlo Guthrie also marked the anniversary with live performances at Bethel earlier in August 2009   Another event occurred in Hawkhurst  Kent  UK   at a Summer of Love party  with acts including two of the participants at the original Woodstock  Barry Melton of Country Joe and the Fish and Robin Williamson of The Incredible String Band  plus Santana and Grateful Dead cover bands  On August 14 and 15  2009  a 40th anniversary tribute concert was held in Woodstock  IL and was the only festival to receive the official blessing of the  Father of Woodstock   Artie Kornfeld  Kornfeld later made an appearance in Woodstock with the event s promoters   Also in 2009  Michael Lang and Holly George Warren published The Road to Woodstock  which describes Lang s involvement in the creation of the Woodstock Music & Arts Festival  and includes personal stories and quotes from central figures involved in the event   5 3  Cultural references  As one of the biggest rock festivals of all time and a cultural touchstone for the late sixties  Woodstock has been referenced in many different ways in popular culture  The phrase  the Woodstock generation  became part of the common lexicon  Tributes and parodies of the festival began almost as soon as the final chords sounded  Cartoonist Charles Schulz named his recurring Peanuts bird character Woodstock in tribute to the festival  In April 1970  Mad magazine published a poem by Frank Jacobs and illustrated by Sergio Aragonés titled  I Remember  I Remember The Wondrous Woodstock Music Fair  that parodies the traffic jams and the challenges of getting close enough to actually hear the music  Keith Robertson s 1970 children s book Henry Reed s Big Show has the title character attempting to emulate the success of the festival by mounting his own concert at his uncle s farm  In 1973  the stage show National Lampoon s Lemmings portrayed the  Woodchuck  festival  featuring parodies of many Woodstock performers   Contemporary culture continues to remember Woodstock  with Time magazine naming  The Who at Woodstock – 1969  to the magazine s  Top 10 Music Festival Moments  list on March 18  2010   In 2005  Argentine writer Edgar Brau published Woodstock  a long poem commemorating the festival  An English translation of the poem was published in January 2007 by Words Without Borders   6  Gallery  File
