Kevlar is the registered trademark for a para aramid synthetic fiber  related to other aramids such as Nomex and Technora  Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965  this high strength material was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires  Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components   Currently  Kevlar has many applications  ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to body armor because of its high tensile strength to weight ratio  by this measure it is 5 times stronger than steel  It is also used to make modern drumheads that withstand high impact  When used as a woven material  it is suitable for mooring lines and other underwater applications   A similar fiber called Twaron with roughly the same chemical structure was developed by Akzo in the 1970s  commercial production started in 1986  and Twaron is now manufactured by Teijin   1  History  Poly paraphenylene terephthalamide – branded Kevlar – was invented by Polish American chemist Stephanie Kwolek while working for DuPont  in anticipation of a gasoline shortage  In 1964  her group began searching for a new lightweight strong fiber to use for light but strong tires  The polymers she had been working with at the time  poly p Phenylene terephthalate and polybenzamide  formed liquid crystal while in solution  something unique to those polymers at the time   The solution was  cloudy  opalescent upon being stirred  and of low viscosity  and usually was thrown away  However  Kwolek persuaded the technician  Charles Smullen  who ran the  spinneret   to test her solution  and was amazed to find that the fiber did not break  unlike nylon  Her supervisor and her laboratory director understood the significance of her accidental discovery and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose  By 1971  modern Kevlar was introduced  However  Kwolek was not very involved in developing the applications of Kevlar   2  Production  Kevlar is synthesized in solution from the monomers 1 4 phenylene diamine  para phenylenediamine  and terephthaloyl chloride in a condensation reaction yielding hydrochloric acid as a byproduct  The result has liquid crystalline behavior  and mechanical drawing orients the polymer chains in the fiber s direction  Hexamethylphosphoramide  HMPA  was the solvent initially used for the polymerization  but for safety reasons  DuPont replaced it by a solution of N methyl pyrrolidone and calcium chloride  As this process had been patented by Akzo  see above  in the production of Twaron  a patent war ensued   Kevlar  poly paraphenylene terephthalamide  production is expensive because of the difficulties arising from using concentrated sulfuric acid  needed to keep the water insoluble polymer in solution during its synthesis and spinning   Several grades of Kevlar are available   Kevlar K 29 – in industrial applications  such as cables  asbestos replacement  brake linings  and body vehicle armor   Kevlar K49 – high modulus used in cable and rope products   Kevlar K100 – colored version of Kevlar  Kevlar K119 – higher elongation  flexible and more fatigue resistant  Kevlar K129 – higher tenacity for ballistic applications  Kevlar AP – 15% higher tensile strength than K 29  Kevlar XP – lighter weight resin and KM2 plus fiber combination  Kevlar KM2 – enhanced ballistic resistance for armor applications The ultraviolet component of sunlight degrades and decomposes Kevlar  a problem known as UV degradation  and so it is rarely used outdoors without protection against sunlight   3  Structure and properties  When Kevlar is spun  the resulting fiber has a tensile strength of about 3 620 MPa  and a relative density of 1 44  The polymer owes its high strength to the many inter chain bonds  These inter molecular hydrogen bonds form between the carbonyl groups and NH centers  Additional strength is derived from aromatic stacking interactions between adjacent strands  These interactions have a greater influence on Kevlar than the van der Waals interactions and chain length that typically influence the properties of other synthetic polymers and fibers such as Dyneema  The presence of salts and certain other impurities  especially calcium  could interfere with the strand interactions and care is taken to avoid inclusion in its production  Kevlar s structure consists of relatively rigid molecules which tend to form mostly planar sheet like structures rather like silk protein   4  Thermal properties  Kevlar maintains its strength and resilience down to cryogenic temperatures  −196 °C   in fact  it is slightly stronger at low temperatures  At higher temperatures the tensile strength is immediately reduced by about 10–20%  and after some hours the strength progressively reduces further  For example at 160 °C  320 °F  about 10% reduction in strength occurs after 500 hours  At 260 °C  500 °F  50% strength reduction occurs after 70 hours   5  Applications  5 1  Protection  5 1 1  Cryogenics  Kevlar is often used in the field of cryogenics for its low thermal conductivity and high strength relative to other materials for suspension purposes  It is most often used to suspend a paramagnetic salt enclosure from a superconducting magnet mandrel in order to minimize any heat leaks to the paramagnetic material  It is also used as a thermal standoff or structural support where low heat leaks are desired   5 1 2  Armor  Kevlar is a well known component of personal armor such as combat helmets  ballistic face masks  and ballistic vests  The PASGT helmet and vest used by United States military forces since the 1980s both have Kevlar as a key component  as do their replacements  Other military uses include bulletproof facemasks used by sentries and spall liners used to protect the crews of armoured fighting vehicles  Even Nimitz class aircraft carriers include Kevlar armor around vital spaces  Related civilian applications include Emergency Service s protection gear if it involves high heat  e g   tackling a fire   and Kevlar body armor such as vests for police officers  security  and SWAT   5 1 3  Personal protection  Kevlar is used to manufacture gloves  sleeves  jackets  chaps and other articles of clothing designed to protect users from cuts  abrasions and heat  Kevlar based protective gear is often considerably lighter and thinner than equivalent gear made of more traditional materials   5 2  Sports equipment  It is used as an inner lining for some bicycle tires to prevent punctures  In table tennis  plies of Kevlar are added to custom ply blades  or paddles  in order to increase bounce and reduce weight  It is used for motorcycle safety clothing  especially in the areas featuring padding such as shoulders and elbows   In kyudo or Japanese archery  it may be used as an alternative to more expensive hemp for bow strings  It is one of the main materials used for paraglider suspension lines   In fencing it is used in the protective jackets  breeches  plastrons and the bib of the masks   Tennis racquets are often strung with Kevlar   It is even used in sails for high performance racing boats   It is increasingly being used in the  peto   the padded covering which protects the picadors  horses in the bullring   5 2 1  Shoes  With advancements in technology  Nike used Kevlar in shoes for the first time  It launched the   with enhancements to its earlier version of basketball shoes by using Kevlar in the anterior as well as the shoe laces  This was done to decrease the elasticity of the tip of the shoe in contrast to nylon used conventionally as Kevlar expanded by about 1% against nylon which expanded by about 30%  Shoes in this range included LeBron  HyperDunk and Zoom Kobe VII  However these shoes were launched at a price range much higher than average cost of basketball shoes   It was also used as speed control patches for certain Soap Shoes models  and the laces for the adidas F50 adiZero Prime football boot   5 3  Music  5 3 1  Audio equipment  Kevlar has also been found to have useful acoustic properties for loudspeaker cones  specifically for bass and midrange drive units  Additionally  Kevlar has been used as a strength member in fiber optic cables such as the ones used for audio data transmissions   5 3 2  Bowed string instruments  Kevlar can be used as an acoustic core on bows for string instruments  Kevlar s physical properties provide strength  flexibility  and stability for the bow s user  To date  the only manufacturer of this type of bow is CodaBow   Kevlar is also presently used as a material for tailcords  aka tailpiece adjusters   which connect the tailpiece to the endpin of bowed string instruments   5 3 3  Drumheads  Kevlar is sometimes used as a material on marching snare drums  It allows for an extremely high amount of tension  resulting in a cleaner sound  There is usually a resin poured onto the Kevlar to make the head airtight  and a nylon top layer to provide a flat striking surface  This is one of the primary types of marching snare drum heads  Remo s  Falam Slam  Patch is made with Kevlar and is used to reinforce bass drum heads where the beater strikes   5 3 4  Woodwind reeds  Kevlar is used in the woodwind reeds of Fibracell  The material of these reeds is a composite of aerospace materials designed to duplicate the way nature constructs cane reed  Very stiff but sound absorbing Kevlar fibers are suspended in a lightweight resin formulation   5 4  Other uses  5 4 1  Fire dancing  Wicks for fire dancing props are made of composite materials with Kevlar in them  Kevlar by itself does not absorb fuel very well  so it is blended with other materials such as fiberglass or cotton  Kevlar s high heat resistance allows the wicks to be reused many times   5 4 2  Frying pans  Kevlar is sometimes used as a substitute for Teflon in some non stick frying pans   5 4 3  Rope  cable  sheath  The fiber is used in woven rope and in cable  where the fibers are kept parallel within a polyethylene sleeve  The cables have been used in suspension bridges such as the bridge at Aberfeldy in Scotland  They have also been used to stabilize cracking concrete cooling towers by circumferential application followed by tensioning to close the cracks  Kevlar is widely used as a protective outer sheath for optical fiber cable  as its strength protects the cable from damage and kinking  When used in this application it is commonly known by the trademarked name Parafil   5 4 4  Electricity generation  Kevlar was used by scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology as a base textile for an experiment in electricity producing clothing  This was done by weaving zinc oxide nanowires into the fabric  If successful  the new fabric would generate about 80 milliwatts per square meter   5 4 5  Building construction  A retractable roof of over 60 000 square feet  5 575 square metres  of Kevlar was a key part of the design of Montreal s Olympic stadium for the 1976 Summer Olympics  It was spectacularly unsuccessful  as it was completed ten years late and replaced just ten years later in May 1998 after a series of problems   5 4 6  Brakes  The chopped fiber has been used as a replacement for asbestos in brake pads  Dust produced from asbestos brakes is toxic  while aramids are a benign substitute   5 4 7  Expansion joints and hoses  Kevlar can be found as a reinforcing layer in rubber bellows expansion joints and rubber hoses  for use in high temperature applications  and for its high strength  It is also found as a braid layer used on the outside of hose assemblies  to add protection against sharp objects   5 4 8  Particle physics  A thin Kevlar window has been used by the NA48 experiment at CERN to separate a vacuum vessel from a vessel at nearly atmospheric pressure  both 192 cm in diameter  The window has provided vacuum tightness combined with reasonably small amount of material  only 0 3% to 0 4% of radiation length    5 4 9  Smartphones  The Motorola RAZR Family and the Motorola Droid Maxx have a kevlar backplate  chosen over other materials such as carbon fiber due to its resilience and lack of interference with signal transmission   5 4 10  Marine Current Turbine and Wind turbine  The Kevlar fiber epoxy matrix composite materials can be used in marine current turbine  MCT  or wind turbine due to their high specific strength and light weight compared to other fibers   6  Composite materials  Aramid fibers are widely used for reinforcing composite materials  often in combination with carbon fiber and glass fiber  The matrix for high performance composites is usually epoxy resin  Typical applications include monocoque bodies for F1 racing cars  helicopter rotor blades  tennis  table tennis  badminton and squash rackets  kayaks  cricket bats  and field hockey  ice hockey and lacrosse sticks   7  See also
