Vibranium is a fictional metal that appears in the Marvel Universe  It is most commonly known as one of the materials used to construct Captain America s shield  but it is also noted for its connection to the Black Panther and his native homeland of Wakanda  a fictional country in Africa    1  Publication history  Vibranium first appeared in Daredevil #13  February 1966   which was by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita  Here  vibranium was seen to be an unusual metallic element with decidedly strange properties  Since that point in Marvel continuity  it has been established that there are a few variations of this element which can be found in isolated regions all around the world  The variation first introduced in Daredevil #13 eventually became known as Anti Metal  with this variation s unique attribute being that it can cut through any metal known to man  In the Marvel Universe  Anti Metal can traditionally be found only in Antarctica  Later in Fantastic Four #53  August 1966   by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby  a newly debuted variation of vibranium was introduced in the isolated nation of Wakanda  This variation had the unique attribute of being able to absorb sound  This is the variation which is most often identified in continuity as simply  vibranium    2  Fictional history  Vibranium was first deposited on Earth by a meteorite 10 000 years ago  The first documented discovery of Vibranium was during a human expedition to Antarctica  This particular isotope of Vibranium was dubbed  Anti Metal  due to its property of dissolving other metals   A different variety of Vibranium found in Wakanda absorbs soundwaves and other vibrations  including kinetic energy  It was discovered by the Wakandan king T Chaka  father of the Black Panther T Challa  To protect this resource  he concealed his country from the outside world  T Chaka funded his country s education by occasionally selling off minute quantities of the metal  As a result  Wakanda is one of the world s most technologically advanced nations   During the early 1940s  a small amount of Wakandan Vibranium came into the possession of the scientist Myron MacLain  He tried to combine Vibranium with iron to form a new tank armor  but was unable to fuse the elements  One morning  he found that the two materials had bonded on their own in an unknown manner  The ultra resilient alloy was used to create Captain America s shield  MacLain worked for decades  without success  to duplicate the accident  However  during an experiment in the 1960s  he developed the virtually indestructible metal adamantium   When T Challa became king of Wakanda  he strove to end his country s isolation from the rest of the world  Making the existence of Vibranium known to the outside world around the mid 1980s  he sold small quantities of it to foreigners whom he believed would not use it to harmful ends  T Challa used the profits to enrich and modernize his nation   Over the years  many have tried to obtain or affect the mound of Vibranium at Wakanda  but for the most part Wakanda has kept it safe  and become quite powerful in the process   During their Secret Invasion of Earth  the Skrulls assumed the identity of S H I E L D  Agents and enslaved natives of the Savage Land to mine Anti Metal  They also invaded Wakanda  The Wakandans repelled the attack successfully   When Wakanda was politically taken over by the xenophobic Desturi  they granted Doctor Doom access to the country s Vibranium vaults  Fearing Doom would use it to amplify his mystical energies  T Challa activated a failsafe he had developed that rendered all processed Vibranium inert   3  Properties and known abilities  In the Marvel Comics Universe  vibranium is a rare  naturally occurring metallic substance theorized to be of extraterrestrial origin which exists in two forms   3 1  Wakandan variety  Wakandan Vibranium is the most common variety  and is often referred to simply as  vibranium   It is a rare substance native only to the small African nation of Wakanda   The Wakandan isotope possesses the ability to absorb all vibrations in the vicinity as well as kinetic energy directed at it  The energy absorbed is stored within the bonds between the molecules that make up the substance  As a result  the more energy vibranium absorbs the tougher it becomes  There are limits to the capacity of the energy that can be stored  and although the exact limitations are not yet known  there have been a few examples  One such instance was when the oil conglomerate Roxxon discovered that a small island in the South Atlantic had a foundation composed of vibranium  Due to this  Roxxon found it necessary to destroy the island and so blew it up with bombs  Unable to absorb the force of the explosions  the vibranium was destroyed  but it did succeed in entirely absorbing the sound made by the explosion  preventing damage to the surrounding area   This variety of vibranium is a powerful mutagen  Vibranium exposure led to the mutation of many Wakandan natives  Its radiation has also permeated much of Wakanda s flora and fauna  including the Heart Shaped Herb eaten by members of the Black Panther Cult and the flesh of the White Gorilla eaten by the members of the White Gorilla Cult  Both give super human abilities to whoever eats them   It is also believed to dramatically enhance mystical energies   3 2  Antarctic variety  Better known as Anti Metal  this isotope is native to the Savage Land  This variation produces vibrations of a specific wavelength that breaks down the molecular bonds in other metals  causing them to liquefy  If huge quantities of anti metal are gathered together  the vibrations increase exponentially  Anti Metal is able to become an artificial and unstable form of the Wakandan variety of vibranium through certain particle bombardments on it   4  Vibranium cancer  When a small sub molecular imperfection was introduced into Captain America s shield  each impact over the years spread to neighboring molecules  It grew until the molecular bonds of the shield were completely broken down  shattering the shield  The shattering effect continued to spread to other vibranium  unconnected to the shield  This created a vibranium  cancer   a shock wave propagating throughout the world  It violently detonated any vibranium it found  from mineral deposits to components of ships or equipment  The shock wave was traveling to the  Great Vibranium Mound  in Wakanda  where the resulting explosion could destroy the world  With the unwitting aid of the villain Klaw  Captain America was able to stop the cancer and restore his shield   5  Notable uses  Due to the nature of vibranium it is found in use of many in the Marvel Universe including   Note  Wakandan variety vibranium is referred to as vibranium and Antarctic variety vibranium is referred to as Anti Metal or Antarctic Vibranium   It is most known for being used in the construction of Captain America s Shield  the vibranium was of an ultra resilient vibranium iron alloy created by Dr  Myron MacLain  The formula has never been reproduced despite numerous attempts   After Steve Rogers resigned as Captain America  the Black Panther sent him a new  pure vibranium shield  When Rogers resumed his role as Captain America  the vibranium shield was given to U S  Agent   As U S  Agent  John Walker has also used two other vibranium shields  the  eagle shield  he used as a member of the Jury  and the  star shield  he used as a member of the New Invaders   Vibranium is used in the creation of one of Hawkeye s  Trick Arrows   the arrows deaden kinetic and vibratory energies   It has been revealed that X Men member Colossus  who can turn into a metal version of his human form  is vulnerable to vibranium when he is using his powers  although his body will return instinctively to human form when confronted with a vibranium weapon   Vibranium is used in the construction of the Constrictor s pair of electrified prehensile  wrist mounted metal coils  The vibranium coils have a contact based aura that suppress sound   In Earth X  Reed Richards constructed a worldwide network of vibranium power centers to solve the looming energy crisis  but the experiment failed   Agent Zero wears a vibranium weave body armor that makes him completely silent as he moves   In the Ultimate Marvel Universe  the Tinkerer discovered a way to use vibranium as a power source   Misty Knight s new arm was built of Anti Metal and Diamond  at close range it can liquefy all known metals including adamantium   Warpath uses a pair of vibranium daggers given to him by Storm   The Black Panther uses vibranium in a micro weave mesh in his uniform that robs incoming objects of their momentum  He also cannot be stabbed  although the costume and the Black Panther can be cut if the attacker slashes along the uniform s grain  Beyond that he uses vibranium in the soles of his boots that allows him to survive a fall of several stories and  if given enough momentum  the Panther can also scale walls or skim across water  The field can be also used offensively to shatter or weaken objects  such as kicking something with the boots  He also used the other variety Anti Metal  in retractable claws   Klaw leapt into his massive sonic converter device which was made with vibranium he bought on the open market  hoping to gain superhuman powers to combat his foes  His gamble was successful as he was transformed into a creature whose body was composed of  living sound    Every wall  both interior and exterior of the Avengers Tower is made of a vibranium reinforced concrete   Teen Tony s Holo Armor has a built in vibranium Psi Shield which is designed to protect the heroes from Onslaught   Vibrania  an African girl was exposed to radioactive vibranium in her father s lab  This gave her the ability to release vibranium powered blasts from her hands   Nezhno Abidemi  a k a  Gentle  has vibranium tattoos covering his body  These tattoos help control his powers  Eventually the strength of the vibranium will wear off and Nezhno s powers will kill him   6  Incidents involving vibranium  Throughout the Marvel Universe there have been a few incidents that resulted due to the presence of vibranium including   Note  Wakandan variety vibranium is referred to as vibranium and Antarctic variety vibranium is referred to as Anti Metal   By 1915  human expeditions discovered Anti Metal in Antarctica   The story  Flags of Our Fathers   which happens during World War II  tells how Black Panther  Captain America  Sgt  Fury and his Howling Commandos fight the Nazis who want to steal vibranium from the Wakandans   Skrulls enslaved Savage Land natives to mine Anti Metal   In an effort to reproduce the special vibranium composition of Captain America s Shield  Dr  Myron MacLain  the maker of said composition created  True  Adamantium   Parnival Plunder  the villainous brother of Ka Zar  planned to use vibranium to make weapons with which to take over the world   Diablo became the ruler of Tierra del Maiz  a South American country for its large deposits of vibranium  While the United Nations had decided not to get involved in the internal affairs of the country  Canada thought differently and sent Alpha Flight to intervene   When Dr  Doom gained access to Wakanda s stores of vibranium  T Challa activated a fail safe that rendered all processed vibranium inert   7  In other media  7 1  Television  In an episode of Spider Man and His Amazing Friends entitled  The X Men Adventure  the villain Cyberiad captures the X Men in their own Danger Room with traps designed to utilize their greatest weaknesses  When Cyberiad traps the newest X Man Kitty Pryde  he locks her in a room made of vibranium  leaving her helpless  Pryde s mutant power is the ability to  phase  or walk through solid matter  but the properties of the  vibranium room  seemed to prevent her from using her powers to escape  She was eventually rescued and she later helped defeat Cyberiad   The episode of Iron Man  Armored Adventures   Panther s Prey  is centered around Iron Man and the Black Panther working to stop Moses Magnum from selling A I M  a piece of stolen vibranium to give MODOK  life  as stated by the Scientist Supreme  It is depicted as a dark grey metal constantly buzzing with light green lightning  It is later used to complete Justin Hammer s Project  TITANIUM  as described by Mr  Fix as the only way to make it whole   Vibranium plays a central role in many episodes of Black Panther  The Animated Series produced by Marvel Animation and BET Entertainment   In the Agents of S H I E L D  episode  The Well   the Bus s interrogation room is stated to have walls lined with a vibranium alloy   7 2  Film  In Ultimate Avengers  The Movie  vibranium is shown as a metal used by the Chitauri  the Ultimate Universe s versions of the Skrulls   It is used primarily in their spacecraft hulls and personal armor  Later  one of their ships is salvaged by S H I E L D  and used to construct Captain America s shield  which also was constructed with adamantium though in the comics in the Ultimate Universe  his shield is only composed of adamantium  and other items such as vibranium tipped bullets and knives  In the movie  S H I E L D  developed a satellite dubbed Shield 1 that was capable of locating vibranium on Earth  This was done in an effort to find the Chitauri and though it worked  the Chitauri soon destroyed it after its introduction in the movie  It should also be noted that according to the movie the only thing S H I E L D  knew capable of penetrating vibranium was a nuclear blast or vibranium itself   In Ultimate Avengers 2  Rise of the Panther  vibranium serves as a bigger plot device than the previous movie as the reason for the Chitauri invasion on Wakanda is Wakanda s massive underground supply of vibranium  In the movie  vibranium is shown as a substantial power source  as condensed vibranium cubes serve as the power source for the Chitauri spaceships  Vibranium also is seen as the principal component of many weapons used in Wakanda  which made them quite powerful though not powerful enough to withstand the Chitauri s attack  Vibranium is also shown to be weakened when exposed to gamma radiation in the movie  thus making it destructible by the Hulk because he releases a blast of it whenever he attacks   In the feature film Iron Man 2  Tony Stark synthesizes a new element to take the place of the palladium that powers his armor  The element is unnamed in the film itself  but the movie s novelization identifies the element as vibranium  so named by Stark because it shares characteristics with uranium and has similar transgenic properties to another fictional element named  vibernum   The appearance of Vibranium in Captain America  The First Avenger  see below  presumably means that the element from Iron Man 2 is not vibranium in the on screen canon   Vibranium is named on screen in the feature film Captain America  The First Avenger  and is shown to exist in the 1940s  Howard Stark states that vibranium is stronger than steel and weighs only one third as much  It is completely vibration absorbent  All the vibranium available to Stark was used to make Captain America s shield  In The Avengers  Captain America s shield proves strong enough to absorb and repel an attack from Thor s mystical hammer Mjölnir  and in Captain America  The Winter Soldier  the shield is also shown to be able to cushion falls from great heights   7 3  Video games  In the computer game Marvel  Ultimate Alliance 2 the nanite artificial intelligence known as  the Fold  attempts to harvest vibranium in Wakanda in order to construct communication towers around the world  spreading its control signal globally  While the heroes of the game manage to thwart the invasion  they are too late to prevent the construction of enough towers to make the Fold a worldwide threat   8  See also  Adamantium  Unobtainium  9  References  10  External links  at    www marveldirectory
