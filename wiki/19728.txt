Marriage  also called matrimony or wedlock  is a socially or ritually recognized union or legal contract between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them  between them and their children  and between them and their in laws  The definition of marriage varies according to different cultures  but it is principally an institution in which interpersonal relationships  usually sexual  are acknowledged  In some cultures  marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing any sexual activity  When defined broadly  marriage is considered a cultural universal   Individuals may marry for several reasons  including legal  social  libidinal  emotional  financial  spiritual  and religious purposes  Who they marry may be influenced by socially determined rules of incest  prescriptive marriage rules  parental choice and individual desire  In some areas of the world arranged marriage  child marriage  polygamy  and sometimes forced marriage  may be practiced as a cultural tradition  Conversely  such practices may be outlawed and penalized in parts of the world out of concerns for human rights and because of international law  In developed parts of the world  there has been a general trend towards ensuring equal rights within marriage for women and legally recognizing the marriages of interracial  interfaith  and same gender couples  Oftentimes  these trends have been motivated by a desire to establish equality and uphold human rights   Marriage can be recognized by a state  an organization  a religious authority  a tribal group  a local community or peers  It is often viewed as a contract  Civil marriage is a marriage without religious content carried out by a government institution in accordance with marriage laws of the jurisdiction  and recognised as creating the rights and obligations intrinsic to matrimony  Marriages can be performed in a secular civil ceremony or in a religious setting via a wedding ceremony  The act of marriage usually creates normative or legal obligations between the individuals involved  and any offspring they may produce  In terms of legal recognition  most sovereign states and other jurisdictions limit marriage to opposite sex couples and a diminishing number of these permit polygyny  child marriages  and forced marriages  Over the twentieth century  a growing number of countries and other jurisdictions have lifted bans on and have established legal recognition for interracial marriage  interfaith marriage and most lately  same sex marriage  Some cultures allow the dissolution of marriage through divorce or annulment  In some areas  child marriages and polygamy may occur in spite of national laws against the practice   Since the late twentieth century  major social changes in Western countries have led to changes in the demographics of marriage  with the age of first marriage increasing  fewer people marrying  and more couples choosing to cohabit rather than marry  For example  the number of marriages in Europe decreased by 30% from 1975 to 2005   Historically  in most cultures  married women had very few rights of their own  being considered  along with the family s children  the property of the husband  as such  they could not own or inherit property  or represent themselves legally  see for example coverture   In Europe  the United States  and other places in the developed world  beginning in the late 19th century and lasting through the 21st century  marriage has undergone gradual legal changes  aimed at improving the rights of the wife  These changes included giving wives legal identities of their own  abolishing the right of husbands to physically discipline their wives  giving wives property rights  liberalizing divorce laws  providing wives with reproductive rights of their own  and requiring a wife s consent when sexual relations occur  These changes have occurred primarily in Western countries  In the 21st century  there continue to be controversies regarding the legal status of married women  legal acceptance or leniency towards violence within marriage  especially sexual violence   traditional marriage customs such as dowry and bride price  forced marriage  marriageable age  and criminalization of consensual behaviors such as premarital and extramarital sex   1  Etymology  The word  marriage  derives from Middle English mariage  which first appears in 1250–1300 CE  This in turn is derived from Old French marier  to marry  and ultimately Latin marītāre meaning to provide with a husband or wife and marītāri meaning to get married  The adjective marīt us  a   um meaning matrimonial or nuptial could also be used in the masculine form as a noun for  husband  and in the feminine form for  wife   The related word  matrimony  derives from the Old French word matremoine which appears around 1300 CE and ultimately derives from Latin mātrimōnium which combines the two concepts mater meaning  mother  and the suffix  monium signifying  action  state  or condition      2  Definitions  Anthropologists have proposed several competing definitions of marriage in an attempt to encompass the wide variety of marital practices observed across cultures  Even within Western culture   definitions of marriage have careened from one extreme to another and everywhere in between   as Evan Gerstmann has put it    2 1  Relation recognized by custom or law  In The History of Human Marriage  1922   Edvard Westermarck defined marriage as  a more or less durable connection between male and female lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till after the birth of the offspring   In The Future of Marriage in Western Civilization  1936   he rejected his earlier definition  instead provisionally defining marriage as  a relation of one or more men to one or more women that is recognized by custom or law    2 2  Legitimacy of offspring  The anthropological handbook Notes and Queries  1951  defined marriage as  a union between a man and a woman such that children born to the woman are the recognized legitimate offspring of both partners   In recognition of a practice by the Nuer of Sudan allowing women to act as a husband in certain circumstances  the Ghost marriage   Kathleen Gough suggested modifying this to  a woman and one or more other persons    In an analysis of marriage among the Nayar  a polyandrous society in India  Gough found that the group lacked a husband role in the conventional sense  that unitary role in the west was divided between a non resident  social father  of the woman s children  and her lovers who were the actual procreators  None of these men had legal rights to the woman s child  This forced Gough to disregard sexual access as a key element of marriage and to define it in terms of legitimacy of offspring alone  marriage is  a relationship established between a woman and one or more other persons  which provides a child born to the woman under circumstances not prohibited by the rules of relationship  is accorded full birth status rights common to normal members of his society or social stratum    Economic anthropologist Duran Bell has criticized the legitimacy based definition on the basis that some societies do not require marriage for legitimacy  He argued that a legitimacy based definition of marriage is circular in societies where illegitimacy has no other legal or social implications for a child other than the mother being unmarried   2 3  Collection of rights  Edmund Leach criticized Gough s definition for being too restrictive in terms of recognized legitimate offspring and suggested that marriage be viewed in terms of the different types of rights it serves to establish  In 1955 article in Man  Leach argued that no one definition of marriage applied to all cultures  He offered a list of ten rights associated with marriage  including sexual monopoly and rights with respect to children  with specific rights differing across cultures  Those rights  according to Leach  included    To establish a legal father of a woman s children   To establish a legal mother of a man s children   To give the husband a monopoly in the wife s sexuality   To give the wife a monopoly in the husband s sexuality   To give the husband partial or monopolistic rights to the wife s domestic and other labour services   To give the wife partial or monopolistic rights to the husband s domestic and other labour services   To give the husband partial or total over property belonging or potentially accruing to the wife   To give the wife partial or total over property belonging or potentially accruing to the husband   To establish a joint fund of property – a partnership – for the benefit of the children of the marriage   To establish a socially significant  relationship of affinity  between the husband and his wife s brothers    2 4  Right of sexual access  In a 1997 article in Current Anthropology  Duran Bell describes marriage as  a relationship between one or more men  male or female  in severalty to one or more women that provides those men with a demand right of sexual access within a domestic group and identifies women who bear the obligation of yielding to the demands of those specific men   In referring to  men in severalty   Bell is referring to corporate kin groups such as lineages which  in having paid brideprice  retain a right in a woman s offspring even if her husband  a lineage member  deceases  Levirate marriage   In referring to  men  male or female    Bell is referring to women within the lineage who may stand in as the  social fathers  of the wife s children born of other lovers   See Nuer  Ghost marriage    3  Types of marriage  3 1  Monogamy  Monogamy is a form of marriage in which an individual has only one spouse during their lifetime or at any one time  serial monogamy    Anthropologist Jack Goody s comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas found a strong correlation between intensive plough agriculture  dowry and monogamy  This pattern was found in a broad swath of Eurasian societies from Japan to Ireland  The majority of Sub Saharan African societies that practice extensive hoe agriculture  in contrast  show a correlation between  Bride price   and polygamy  A further study drawing on the Ethnographic Atlas showed a statistical correlation between increasing size of the society  the belief in  high gods  to support human morality  and monogamy   In the countries which do not permit polygamy  a person who marries in one of those countries a person while still being lawfully married to another commits the crime of bigamy  In all cases  the second marriage is considered legally null and void  Besides the second and subsequent marriages being void  the bigamist is also liable to other penalties  which also vary between jurisdictions   3 1 1  Serial monogamy  Governments that support monogamy  may allow easy divorce  In a number of Western countries divorce rates approach 50%  Those who remarry do so on average 3 times  Divorce and remarriage can thus result in  serial monogamy   i e  multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time  This can be interpreted as a form of plural mating  as are those societies dominated by female headed families in the Caribbean  Mauritius and Brazil where there is frequent rotation of unmarried partners  In all  these account for 16 to 24% of the  monogamous  category   Serial monogamy creates a new kind of relative  the  ex    The  ex wife   for example  remains an active part of her  ex husband s  life  as they may be tied together by transfers of resources  alimony  child support   or shared child custody  Bob Simpson notes that in the British case  serial monogamy creates an  extended family  – a number of households tied together in this way  including mobile children  possible ex s may include an ex wife  an ex brother in law  etc   but not an  ex child    These  unclear families  do not fit the mould of the monogamous nuclear family  As a series of connected households  they come to resemble the polygynous model of separate households maintained by mothers with children  tied by a male to whom they are married or divorced   3 2  Polygamy  Polygamy is a marriage which includes more than two partners  When a man is married to more than one wife at a time  the relationship is called polygyny  and there is no marriage bond between the wives  and when a woman is married to more than one husband at a time  it is called polyandry  and there is no marriage bond between the husbands  If a marriage includes multiple husbands and wives  it can be called group marriage   A molecular genetic study of global human genetic diversity argued that sexual polygyny was typical of human reproductive patterns until the shift to sedentary farming communities approximately 10 000 to 5 000 years ago in Europe and Asia  and more recently in Africa and the Americas  As noted above  Anthropologist Jack Goody s comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas found that the majority of Sub Saharan African societies that practice extensive hoe agriculture show a correlation between  Bride price   and polygamy  A survey of other cross cultural samples has confirmed that the absence of the plough was the only predictor of polygamy  although other factors such as high male mortality in warfare  in non state societies  and pathogen stress  in state societies  had some impact   Marriages are classified according to the number of legal spouses an individual has  The suffix   gamy  refers specifically to the number of spouses  as in bi gamy  two spouses  generally illegal in most nations   and poly gamy  more than one spouse    Societies show variable acceptance of polygamy as a cultural ideal and practice  According to the Ethnographic Atlas  of 1 231 societies noted  186 were monogamous  453 had occasional polygyny  588 had more frequent polygyny  and 4 had polyandry  However  as Miriam Zeitzen writes  social tolerance for polygamy is different from the practice of polygamy  since it requires wealth to establish multiple households for multiple wives  The actual practice of polygamy in a tolerant society may actually be low  with the majority of aspirant polygamists practicing monogamous marriage  Tracking the occurrence of polygamy is further complicated in jurisdictions where it has been banned  but continues to be practiced  de facto polygamy    Zeitzen also notes that Western perceptions of African society and marriage patterns are biased by  contradictory concerns of nostalgia for traditional African culture versus critique of polygamy as oppressive to women or detrimental to development   Polygamy has been condemned as being a form of human rights abuse  with concerns arising over domestic abuse  forced marriage  and neglect  The vast majority of the world s countries  including virtually all of the world s developed nations  do not permit polygamy  There have been calls for the abolition of polygamy in developing countries   3 2 1  Polygyny  Although a society may be classified as polgynous  not all marriages in it necessarily are  monogamous marriages may in fact predominate  It is to this flexibility that Anthropologist Robin Fox attributes its success as a social support system   This has often meant – given the imbalance in the sex ratios  the higher male infant mortality  the shorter life span of males  the loss of males in wartime  etc  – that often women were left without financial support from husbands  To correct this condition  females had to be killed at birth  remain single  become prostitutes  or be siphoned off into celibate religious orders  Polygynous systems have the advantage that they can promise  as did the Mormons  a home and family for every woman    Nonetheless  polygyny is a gender issue which offers men asymmetrical benefits  In some cases  there is a large age discrepancy  as much as a generation  between a man and his youngest wife  compounding the power differential between the two  Tensions not only exist between genders  but also within genders  senior and junior men compete for wives  and senior and junior wives in the same household may experience radically different life conditions  and internal hierarchy  Several studies have suggested that the wive s relationship with other women  including co wives and husband s female kin  are more critical relationships than that with her husband for her productive  reproductive and personal achievement  In some societies  the co wives are relatives  usually sisters  a practice called sororal polygyny  the pre existing relationship between the co wives is thought to decrease potential tensions within the marriage   Fox argues that  the major difference between polygyny and monogamy could be stated thus  while plural mating occurs in both systems  under polygyny several unions may be recognized as being legal marriages while under monogamy only one of the unions is so recognized  Often  however  it is difficult to draw a hard and fast line between the two    As polygamy in Africa is increasingly subject to legal limitations  a variant form of de facto  as opposed to legal or de jure  polygyny is being practised in urban centres  Although it does not involve multiple  now illegal  formal marriages  the domestic and personal arrangements follow old polygynous patterns  The de facto form of polygyny is found in other parts of the world as well  including some Mormon sects and Muslim families in the United States   In some societies such as the Lovedu of South Africa  or the Nuer of the Sudan  aristocratic women may become female  husbands   In the Lovedu case  this female husband may take a number of polygamous wives  This is not a lesbian relationship  but a means of legitimately expanding a royal lineage by attaching these wives  children to it  The relationships are considered polygynous  not polyandrous  because the female husband is in fact assuming masculine gendered political roles   Religious groups have differing views on the legitimacy of polygyny  It is allowed in Islam and Confucianism  though in most areas today it is uncommon  Judaism  Christianity and Hinduism have allowed polygyny in the past  but it is prohibited today   3 2 2  Polyandry  Polyandry is notably more rare than polygyny  though less rare than the figure commonly cited in the Ethnographic Atlas  1980  which listed only those polyandrous societies found in the Himalayan Mountains  More recent studies have found 53 societies outside the 28 found in the Himalayans which practice polyandry  It is most common in egalitarian societies marked by high male mortality or male absenteeism  It is associated with partible paternity  the cultural belief that a child can have more than one father   The explanation for polyandry in the Himalayan Mountains is related to the scarcity of land  the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife  fraternal polyandry  allows family land to remain intact and undivided  If every brother married separately and had children  family land would be split into unsustainable small plots  In Europe  this was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance  the dis inheriting of most siblings  some of whom went on to become celibate monks and priests    3 2 3  Plural marriage  Group marriage  also known as multi lateral marriage  is a form of polyamory in which more than two persons form a family unit  with all the members of the group marriage being considered to be married to all the other members of the group marriage  and all members of the marriage share parental responsibility for any children arising from the marriage  No country legally condones group marriages  neither under the law nor as a common law marriage  but historically it has been practiced by some cultures of Polynesia  Asia  Papua New Guinea and the Americas – as well as in some intentional communities and alternative subcultures such as the Oneida Perfectionists in up state New York  Of the 250 societies reported by the American anthropologist George P  Murdock in 1949  only the Caingang of Brazil had any group marriages at all   3 3  Child marriage  A child marriage is a marriage where one or both spouses are under the age of 18  It is related to child betrothal and teenage pregnancy  Child marriage was common throughout history but is today condemned by international human rights organizations  Child marriages are often arranged between the families of the future bride and groom  sometimes as soon as the girl is born  Child marriages can also occur in the context of marriage by abduction   While child marriage is observed for both boys and girls  the overwhelming majority of child spouses are girls  In many cases  only one marriage partner is a child  usually the female  due to the importance placed upon female virginity  Causes of child marriage include poverty  bride price  dowry  laws that allow child marriages  religious and social pressures  regional customs  fear of remaining unmarried  and perceived inability of women to work for money   Today  child marriages are widespread in parts of the world  being most common in South Asia and sub Saharan Africa  with more than half of the girls in some countries in those regions being married before 18  The incidence of child marriage has been falling in most parts of the world  In developed countries child marriage is outlawed or restricted   Girls who marry before 18 are at greater risk of becoming victims of domestic violence  than those who marry later  especially when they are married to a much older man   3 4  Same sex and third gender marriages  As noted above  several kinds of same gendered  non sexual marriages exist in some lineage based societies  this section relates to same gendered sexual unions  However  some cultures include third gender  two spirited or transgendered  individuals  such as the berdache of the Zuni in New Mexico  is the marriage between a berdache and a man a  same sex marriage   We wha  one of the most revered Zuni elders  an Ihamana  spiritual leader  served as an emissary of the Zuni to Washington  where he met President Grover Cleveland  We wha had a husband who was generally recognized as such   While it is a relatively new practice to grant same sex couples the same form of legal marital recognition as commonly granted to mixed sex couples  there is some history of recorded same sex unions around the world  Ancient Greek same sex relationships were like modern companionate marriages  unlike their different sex marriages in which the spouses had few emotional ties  and the husband had freedom to engage in outside sexual liaisons  The Theodosian Code  C  Th  9 7 3  issued in 342 CE imposed severe penalties or death on same sex relationships but the exact intent of the law and its relation to social practice is unclear  as only a few examples of same sex marriage in that culture exist  Same sex unions were celebrated in some regions of China  such as Fujian   3 5  Temporary marriages  Several cultures have practiced temporary and conditional marriages  Examples include the Celtic practice of handfasting and fixed term marriages in the Muslim community  Pre Islamic Arabs practiced a form of temporary marriage that carries on today in the practice of Nikah Mut ah  a fixed term marriage contract  The Islamic prophet Muhammad sanctioned a temporary marriage – sigheh in Iran and muta a in Iraq – which can provide a legitimizing cover for sex workers  The same forms of temporary marriage have been used in Egypt  Lebanon and Iran to make the donation of a human ova legal for in vitro fertilization  a woman cannot  however  use this kind of marriage to obtain a sperm donation  Muslim controversies related to Nikah Mut ah have resulted in the practice being confined mostly to Shi ite communities  The matrilineal Mosuo of China practice what they call  walking marriage    3 6  Cohabitation  In some jurisdictions cohabitation may constitute a common law marriage  and in some countries the laws recognize cohabitation in lieu of institutional marriage for taxation and social security benefits  This is the case  for example  in Australia  Common law marriage is an option pursued as a form of resistance to traditional institutionalized marriage  However  in this context  nations reserve the right to define the relationship as marital  based only on a history of co habitation   Conversely  institutionalized marriages may not involve cohabitation  In some cases couples living together do not wish to be recognized as married  This may occur because pension or alimony rights are adversely affected  because of taxation considerations  because of immigration issues  or for other reasons  Such marriages have also been increasingly common in Beijing  Guo Jianmei  director of the center for women s studies at Beijing University  told a Newsday correspondent   Walking marriages reflect sweeping changes in Chinese society   A  walking marriage  refers to a type of temporary marriage formed by the Mosuo of China  in which male partners live elsewhere and make nightly visits  A similar arrangement in Saudi Arabia  called misyar marriage  also involves the husband and wife living separately but meeting regularly   4  Partner selection  There is wide cross cultural variation in the social rules governing the selection of a partner for marriage  There is variation in the degree to which partner selection is an individual decision by the partners or a collective decision by the partners  kin groups  and there is variation in the rules regulating which partners are valid choices   The United Nations World Fertility Report of 2003 reports that 89% of all people get married before age forty nine  The percent of women and men who marry before age forty nine drops to nearly 50% in some nations and reaches 100% in other nations   In other cultures with less strict rules governing the groups from which a partner can be chosen the selection of a marriage partner may involve either the couple going through a selection process of courtship or the marriage may be arranged by the couple s parents or an outside party  a matchmaker   4 1  The incest taboo  exogamy and endogamy  Societies have often placed restrictions on marriage to relatives  though the degree of prohibited relationship varies widely  Marriages between parents and children  or between full siblings  with few exceptions  have been considered incest and forbidden  However  marriages between more distant relatives have been much more common  with one estimate being that 80% of all marriages in history have been between second cousins or closer  This proportion has fallen dramatically  but still more than 10% of all marriages are believed to be between first and second cousins  In the United States  such marriages are now highly stigmatized  and laws ban most or all first cousin marriage in 30 states  Specifics vary  in South Korea  historically it was illegal to marry someone with the same last name and same ancestral line   An Avunculate marriage is a marriage that occurs between an uncle and his niece or between an aunt and her nephew  Such marriages are illegal in most countries due to incest restrictions  However a small number of countries have legalized it  including Argentina  Australia  Austria  Malaysia  and Russia   In various societies the choice of partner is often limited to suitable persons from specific social groups  In some societies the rule is that a partner is selected from an individual s own social group – endogamy  this is often the case in class and caste based societies  But in other societies a partner must be chosen from a different group than one s own – exogamy  this may be the case in societies practicing totemic religion where society is divided into several exogamous totemic clans  such as most Aboriginal Australian societies  In other societies a person is expected to marry their cross cousin  a woman must marry her father s sister s son and a man must marry his mother s brother s daughter – this is often the case if either a society has a rule of tracing kinship exclusively through patrilineal or matrilineal descent groups as among the Akan people of West Africa  Another kind of marriage selection is the levirate marriage in which widows are obligated to marry their husband s brother  mostly found in societies where kinship is based on endogamous clan groups   Religion has commonly weighed in on the matter of which relatives  if any  are allowed to marry  Relations may be by consanguinity or affinity  meaning by blood or by marriage  On the marriage of cousins  Catholic policy has evolved from initial acceptance  through a long period of general prohibition  to the contemporary requirement for a dispensation  Islam has always allowed it  while Hindu strictures vary widely   4 2  Prescriptive marriage  In a wide array of lineage based societies with a classificatory kinship system  potential spouses are sought from a specific class of relative as determined by a prescriptive marriage rule  This rule may be expressed by anthropologists using a  descriptive  kinship term  such as a  man s mother s brother s daughter   also known as a  cross cousin    Such descriptive rules mask the participant s perspective  a man should marry a woman from his mother s lineage  Within the society s kinship terminology  such relatives are usually indicated by a specific term which sets them apart as potentially marriageable  Pierre Bourdieu notes  however  that very few marriages ever follow the rule  and that when they do so  it is for  practical kinship  reasons such as the preservation of family property  rather than the  official kinship  ideology   Insofar as regular marriages following prescriptive rules occur  lineages are linked together in fixed relationships  these ties between lineages may form political alliances in kinship dominated societies  French structural anthropologist Claude Lévi Strauss developed alliance theory to account for the  elementary  kinship structures created by the limited number of prescriptive marriage rules possible   A pragmatic  or  arranged   marriage is made easier by formal procedures of family or group politics  A responsible authority sets up or encourages the marriage  they may  indeed  engage a professional matchmaker to find a suitable spouse for an unmarried person  The authority figure could be parents  family  a religious official  or a group consensus  In some cases  the authority figure may choose a match for purposes other than marital harmony   4 3  Forced marriage  A forced marriage is a marriage in which one or both of the parties is married against their will  Forced marriages continue to be practiced in parts of the world  especially in South Asia and Africa  The line between forced marriage and consensual marriage may become blurred  because the social norms of these cultures dictate that one should never oppose the desire of one s parents relatives in regard to the choice of a spouse  in such cultures it is not necessary for violence  threats  intimidation etc  to occur  the person simply  consents  to the marriage even if he she doesn t want it  out of the implied social pressure and duty  The customs of bride price and dowry  that exist in parts of the world  can lead to buying and selling people into marriage   In some societies  ranging from Central Asia to the Caucasus to Africa  the custom of bride kidnapping still exists  in which a woman is captured by a man and his friends  Sometimes this covers an elopement  but sometimes it depends on sexual violence  In previous times  raptio was a larger scale version of this  with groups of women captured by groups of men  sometimes in war  the most famous example is The Rape of the Sabine Women  which provided the first citizens of Rome with their wives   Other marriage partners are more or less imposed on an individual  For example  widow inheritance provides a widow with another man from her late husband s brothers   In rural areas of India  child marriage is practiced  with parents often arranging the wedding  sometimes even before the child is born  This practice was made illegal under the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929   4 4  Companionate marriage  Eva Illouz argues that the  love   companionate  marriage emerged at the same time as the rise of capitalism in European and American society   Love  is not the raw emotion that Western representations make it out to be  but a cultural construction shaped by the social and economic conditions of modern industrial society  Industrialization weakened the ties between extended families  and made the nuclear family the norm  In this view  love is a culturally constructed label for physiological arousal that is shrouded in cultural symbols that situate the emerging relationship within a particular set of cultural expectations – one of which leads to marriage as an institution  These cultural expectations are shaped by a number of cultural industries  such as advertising  film and television  and the  wedding industry   Until the turn of the twentieth century  marriage was viewed as one of the most important financial decisions of one s life  determined in large part by property transfers such as dowry  or dower   and romantic love was viewed as disruptive of the rational economic decision making needed  Under the development of capitalism  this changed   Romantic love  then  precedes capitalism per se but articulates two leitmotifs that will later resonate with capitalism s central ideological themes  One concerns the sovereignty of the individual vis à vis the group  such sovereignty being affirmed in illicit sexual choices and in the lovers  refusal to conform to the rules of endogamy set by the group  The other concerns the distinction central to bourgeois ideology between interest and sentiments  selfishness and selflessness  embodied respectively in the public and private spheres  In this division  romantic love asserts the privilege of sentiments over social and economic interests  of gratuity over profit  of abundance over the deprivations caused by accumulation  In proclaiming the supremacy of human relationships governed by the disinterested gift of oneself  love not only celebrates the fusion of individual souls and bodies but also opens the possibility of an alternative social order  Love thus projects an aura of transgression and both promises and demands a better world   5  Economic considerations  The financial aspects of marriage vary between cultures and have changed over time   In some cultures  dowries and bridewealth continue to be required today  In both cases  the financial arrangements are usually made between the groom  or his family  and the bride s family  with the bride often not being involved in the negotiations  and often not having a choice in whether to participate in the marriage   In Early Modern Britain  the social status of the couple was supposed to be equal  After the marriage  all the property  called  fortune   and expected inheritances of the wife belonged to the husband   5 1  Dowry  A dowry is  a process whereby parental property is distributed to a daughter at her marriage  i e  inter vivos  rather than at the holder s death  mortis causa … A dowry establishes some variety of conjugal fund  the nature of which may vary widely  This fund ensures her support  or endowment  in widowhood and eventually goes to provide for her sons and daughters    In some cultures  especially in South Asia  in countries such as India  Bangladesh  Pakistan  Sri Lanka and Nepal  dowries continue to be expected  In India  nearly 7 000 women were killed in 2001 over dowries  and activists believe that figures represent a third of the actual number of such murders  Dowry related violence is a problem in several places  see dowry deaths   and  in response to violent incidents regarding the practice  several jurisdictions have enacted laws restricting or banning dowry  see Dowry law in India   In Nepal  dowry has been made illegal in 2009  Some authors believe that the giving and receiving of dowry reflects the status and even the effort to climb high in social hierarchy   5 2  Dower  Direct Dowry contrasts with bridewealth  which is paid by the groom or his family to the bride s parents  and with indirect dowry  or dower   which is property given to the bride herself by the groom at the time of marriage and which remains under her ownership and control   In the Jewish tradition  the rabbis in ancient times insisted on the marriage couple entering into a prenuptial agreement  called a ketubah  Besides other things  the ketubah provided for an amount to be paid by the husband in the event of a divorce or his estate in the event of his death  This amount was a replacement of the biblical dower or bride price  which was payable at the time of the marriage by the groom to the father of the bride  This innovation was put in place because the biblical bride price created a major social problem  many young prospective husbands could not raise the bride price at the time when they would normally be expected to marry  So  to enable these young men to marry  the rabbis  in effect  delayed the time that the amount would be payable  when they would be more likely to have the sum  It may also be noted that both the dower and the ketubah amounts served the same purpose  the protection for the wife should her support cease  either by death or divorce  The only difference between the two systems was the timing of the payment  It is the predecessor to the wife s present day entitlement to maintenance in the event of the breakup of marriage  and family maintenance in the event of the husband not providing adequately for the wife in his will  Another function performed by the ketubah amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating divorcing his wife  he would need to have the amount to be able to pay to the wife   Morning gifts  which might also be arranged by the bride s father rather than the bride  are given to the bride herself  the name derives from the Germanic tribal custom of giving them the morning after the wedding night  She might have control of this morning gift during the lifetime of her husband  but is entitled to it when widowed  If the amount of her inheritance is settled by law rather than agreement  it may be called dower  Depending on legal systems and the exact arrangement  she may not be entitled to dispose of it after her death  and may lose the property if she remarries  Morning gifts were preserved for centuries in morganatic marriage  a union where the wife s inferior social status was held to prohibit her children from inheriting a noble s titles or estates  In this case  the morning gift would support the wife and children  Another legal provision for widowhood was jointure  in which property  often land  would be held in joint tenancy  so that it would automatically go to the widow on her husband s death   Islamic tradition has similar practices  A  mahr   either immediate or deferred  is the woman s portion of the groom s wealth  divorce  or estate  death   These amounts are usually set on the basis of the groom s own and family wealth and incomes  but in some parts these are set very high so as to provide a disincentive for the groom exercising the divorce  or the husband s family  inheriting  a large portion of the estate  especially if there are no male offspring from the marriage  In some countries  including Iran  the mahr or alimony can amount to more than a man can ever hope to earn  sometimes up to US$1 000 000  4000 official Iranian gold coins   If the husband cannot pay the mahr  either in case of a divorce or on demand  according to the current laws in Iran  he will have to pay it by installments  Failure to pay the mahr might even lead to imprisonment   5 3  Bridewealth  Bridewealth is a common practice in parts of South East Asia  Thailand  Cambodia   parts of Central Asia  and in much of sub Saharan Africa  It is also known as brideprice although this has fallen in disfavor as it implies the purchase of the bride  Bridewealth is the amount of money or property or wealth paid by the groom or his family to the parents of a woman upon the marriage of their daughter to the groom  In anthropological literature  bride price has often been explained as payment made to compensate the bride s family for the loss of her labor and fertility  In some cases  bridewealth is a means by which the groom s family s ties to the children of the union are recognized   5 4  Taxation  In some countries a married person or couple benefits from various taxation advantages not available to a single person  For example  spouses may be allowed to average their combined incomes  This is advantageous to a married couple with disparate incomes  To compensate for this  countries may provide a higher tax bracket for the averaged income of a married couple  While income averaging might still benefit a married couple with a stay at home spouse  such averaging would cause a married couple with roughly equal personal incomes to pay more total tax than they would as two single persons  In the United States  this is called the marriage penalty   When the rates applied by the tax code are not based income averaging  but rather on the sum of individuals  incomes  higher rates will usually apply to each individual in a two earner households in a progressive tax systems  This is most often the case with high income taxpayers and is another situation called a marriage penalty   Conversely  when progressive tax is levied on the individual with no consideration for the partnership  dual income couples fare much better than single income couples with similar household incomes  The effect can be increased when the welfare system treats the same income as a shared income thereby denying welfare access to the non earning spouse  Such systems apply in Australia and Canada  for example   6  Post marital residence  In many Western cultures  marriage usually leads to the formation of a new household comprising the married couple  with the married couple living together in the same home  often sharing the same bed  but in some other cultures this is not the tradition  Among the Minangkabau of West Sumatra  residency after marriage is matrilocal  with the husband moving into the household of his wife s mother  Residency after marriage can also be patrilocal or avunculocal  In these cases  married couples may not form an independent household  but remain part of an extended family household   Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence connected it with the sexual division of labor  However  to date  cross cultural tests of this hypothesis using worldwide samples have failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables  However  Korotayev s tests show that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal residence in general  However  this correlation is masked by a general polygyny factor   Although an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence  it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non sororal polygyny which effectively destroys matrilocality  If this polygyny factor is controlled  e g   through a multiple regression model   division of labor turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence  Thus  Murdock s hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labor and postmarital residence were basically correct  though the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected   There has been a trend toward the neolocal residence in western societies   7  Marriage law  Marriage laws refer to the legal requirements which determine the validity of a marriage  which vary considerably between countries   7 1  Rights and obligations  A marriage bestows rights and obligations on the married parties  and sometimes on relatives as well  being the sole mechanism for the creation of affinal ties  in laws   These may include  depending on jurisdiction   Giving a husband wife or his her family control over a spouse s sexual services  labor  and property   Giving a husband wife responsibility for a spouse s debts   Giving a husband wife visitation rights when his her spouse is incarcerated or hospitalized   Giving a husband wife control over his her spouse s affairs when the spouse is incapacitated   Establishing the second legal guardian of a parent s child   Establishing a joint fund of property for the benefit of children   Establishing a relationship between the families of the spouses  These rights and obligations vary considerably between societies  and between groups within society  These might include arranged marriages  family obligations  the legal establishment of a nuclear family unit  the legal protection of children and public declaration of commitment   7 2  Property regime  In many countries today  each marriage partner has the choice of keeping his or her property separate or combining properties  In the latter case  called community property  when the marriage ends by divorce each owns half  In lieu of a will or trust  property owned by the deceased generally is inherited by the surviving spouse   In some legal systems  the partners in a marriage are  jointly liable  for the debts of the marriage  This has a basis in a traditional legal notion called the  Doctrine of Necessities  whereby a husband was responsible to provide necessary things for his wife  Where this is the case  one partner may be sued to collect a debt for which they did not expressly contract  Critics of this practice note that debt collection agencies can abuse this by claiming an unreasonably wide range of debts to be expenses of the marriage  The cost of defense and the burden of proof is then placed on the non contracting party to prove that the expense is not a debt of the family  The respective maintenance obligations  both during and eventually after a marriage  are regulated in most jurisdictions  alimony is one such method   7 3  Marriage restrictions  Marriage is an institution that is historically filled with restrictions  From age  to race  to social status  to consanguinity  to gender  restrictions are placed on marriage by society for reasons of benefiting the children  passing on healthy genes  maintaining cultural values  or because of prejudice and fear  Almost all cultures that recognize marriage also recognize adultery as a violation of the terms of marriage   7 3 1  Age  Most jurisdictions set a minimum age for marriage  that is  a person must attain a certain age to be legally allowed to marry  This age may depend on circumstances  for instance exceptions from the general rule may be permitted if the parents of a young person express their consent and or if a court decides that said marriage is in the best interest of the young person  often this applies in cases where a girl is pregnant   Although most age restrictions are in place in order to prevent children from being forced into marriages  especially to much older partners – marriages which can have negative education and health related consequences  and lead to child sexual abuse and other forms of violence – such child marriages remain common in parts of the world  According to the UN  child marriages are most common in rural sub Saharan Africa and South Asia  The ten countries with the highest rates of child marriage are  Niger  75%   Chad  Central African Republic  Bangladesh  Guinea  Mozambique  Mali  Burkina Faso  South Sudan  and Malawi   7 3 2  Race  Laws banning  race mixing  were enforced in certain North American jurisdictions from 1691 until 1967  in Nazi Germany  The Nuremberg Laws  from 1935 until 1945  and in South Africa during most part of the Apartheid era  1949–1985   All these laws primarily banned marriage between persons of different racially or ethnically defined groups  which was termed  amalgamation  or  miscegenation  in the U S  The laws in Nazi Germany and many of the U S  states  as well as South Africa  also banned sexual relations between such individuals   In the United States  laws in some but not all of the states prohibited the marriage of whites and blacks  and in many states also the intermarriage of whites with Native Americans or Asians  In the U S   such laws were known as anti miscegenation laws  From 1913 until 1948  30 out of the then 48 states enforced such laws  Although an  Anti Miscegenation Amendment  to the United States Constitution was proposed in 1871  in 1912–1913  and in 1928  no nation wide law against racially mixed marriages was ever enacted  In 1967  the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Loving v  Virginia that anti miscegenation laws are unconstitutional  With this ruling  these laws were no longer in effect in the remaining 16 states that still had them   The Nazi ban on interracial marriage and interracial sex was enacted in September 1935 as part of the Nuremberg Laws  the Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre  The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour   The Nuremberg Laws classified Jews as a race  and forbade marriage and extramarital sexual relations at first with people of Jewish descent  but was later ended to the  Gypsies  Negroes or their bastard offspring  and people of  German or related blood   Such relations was marked as Rassenschande  lit   race disgrace   and could be punished by imprisonment  usually followed by deportation to a concentration camp  and even by death   South Africa under apartheid also banned interracial marriage  The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 prohibited marriage between persons of different races  and the Immorality Act of 1950 made sexual relations with a person of a different race a criminal offence   7 3 3  Same sex marriage recognition  The first laws in modern times recognizing same sex marriage were enacted during the first decade of the 21st century  As of May 2013  thirteen countries  Argentina  Belgium  Brazil  Canada  Denmark  France  Iceland  the Netherlands  Norway  Portugal  Spain  South Africa  Sweden   and several sub national jurisdictions  parts of Mexico and the United States   allow same sex couples to marry  Uruguay and New Zealand have both enacted laws to legalize same sex marriage which will come into force in August 2013  Bills allowing legal recognition of same sex marriage have been proposed  are pending  or have passed at least one legislative house in Andorra  Colombia  Finland  Germany  Luxembourg  Nepal  Taiwan  and the United Kingdom  as well as in the legislatures of several sub national jurisdictions  in Scotland as well as parts of Australia  Mexico  and the United States    Introduction of same sex marriage laws has varied by jurisdiction  being variously accomplished through a legislative change to marriage laws  a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality  or by direct popular vote  via a ballot initiative or a referendum   The recognition of same sex marriage is a political  social  civil rights and religious issue in many nations  and debates continue to arise over whether same sex couples should be allowed marriage  be required to hold a different status  a civil union   or be denied recognition of such rights  Allowing same gender couples to legally marry is considered to be one of the most important of all LGBT rights  It is a relatively new practice that same sex couples are being granted the same form of legal marital recognition available to mixed sexed couples  In the United States  the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act  DOMA  explicitly defined marriage for the purposes of federal law as between a man and a woman and allowed states to ignore same sex marriages from other states  Section 3 of the law was struck down in United States v  Windsor  2013  which prevented the Federal Government form recognizing same sex marriage  Section 2  which allows states to not recognize same sex marriage in other states is still in effect  As of June 2013  thirty six US states currently define marriage as between a man and a woman  Three of those states have statutory language that pre dates DOMA  enacted before 1996  defining marriage as such  Thirty states have defined marriage in their constitutions  Arizona defeated a constitutional amendment defining marriage as only between a man and a woman  2006   but it subsequently passed one in 2008  In 2012  Minnesota defeated a similar amendment  and enacted legislation to legalize same sex marriages in May 2013   7 3 4  Number of spouses in a marriage  Polygyny is widely practiced in mostly Muslim and African countries  In the Middle Eastern region  Israel  Turkey and Tunisia are notable exceptions   In most other jurisdictions  polygamy is illegal  For example  In the United States  polygamy is illegal in all 50 states   Over a century ago  citizens of the self governing territory of what is present day Utah were forced by the United States federal government to abandon the practice of polygamy through the vigorous enforcement of several Acts of Congress and eventually complied  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints formally abolished the practice in 1890  in a document labeled  The Manifesto   Among American Muslims  a small minority of around 50 000 to 100 000 people are estimated to live in families with a husband maintaining an illegal polygamous relationship   Several countries such as India and Sri Lanka  permit only their Islamic citizens to practice polygny  Some Indians have converted to Islam in order to bypass such legal restrictions  Predominantly Christian nations usually do not allow polygamous unions  with a handful of exceptions being the Republic of the Congo  Uganda  and Zambia  Myanmar  frequently referred to as Burma  is also the only predominately Buddhist nation to allow for civil polygynous marriages  though such is rarely tolerated by the Burmese population   7 4  State recognition  In various jurisdictions  a civil marriage may take place as part of the religious marriage ceremony  although they are theoretically distinct  Some jurisdictions allow civil marriages in circumstances which are notably not allowed by particular religions  such as same sex marriages or civil unions   The opposite case may happen as well  Partners may not have full juridical acting capacity and churches may have less strict limits than the civil jurisdictions  This particularly applies to minimum age  or physical infirmities   It is possible for two people to be recognised as married by a religious or other institution  but not by the state  and hence without the legal rights and obligations of marriage  or to have a civil marriage deemed invalid and sinful by a religion  Similarly  a couple may remain married in religious eyes after a civil divorce   7 4 1  Marriage license  civil ceremony and registration  A marriage is usually formalized at a wedding or marriage ceremony  The ceremony may be officiated either by a religious official  by a government official or by a state approved celebrant  In various European and some Latin American countries  any religious ceremony must be held separately from the required civil ceremony  Some countries – such as Belgium  Bulgaria  France  the Netherlands  Romania and Turkey – require that a civil ceremony take place before any religious one  In some countries – notably the United States  Canada  the United Kingdom  the Republic of Ireland  Norway and Spain – both ceremonies can be held together  the officiant at the religious and civil ceremony also serving as agent of the state to perform the civil ceremony  To avoid any implication that the state is  recognizing  a religious marriage  which is prohibited in some countries  – the  civil  ceremony is said to be taking place at the same time as the religious ceremony  Often this involves simply signing a register during the religious ceremony  If the civil element of the religious ceremony is omitted  the marriage ceremony is not recognized as a marriage by government under the law   Some countries  such as Australia  permit marriages to be held in private and at any location  others  including England and Wales  require that the civil ceremony be conducted in a place open to the public and specially sanctioned by law for the purpose  In England  the place of marriage formerly had to be a church or register office  but this was extended to any public venue with the necessary licence  An exception can be made in the case of marriage by special emergency license  UK  licence   which is normally granted only when one of the parties is terminally ill  Rules about where and when persons can marry vary from place to place  Some regulations require one of the parties to reside within the jurisdiction of the register office  formerly parish    Each religious authority has rules for the manner in which marriages are to be conducted by their officials and members  Where religious marriages are recognised by the state  the officiator must also conform with the law of the jurisdiction   7 4 2  Common law marriage  In a small number of jurisdictions marriage relationships may be created by the operation of the law alone  Unlike the typical ceremonial marriage with legal contract  wedding ceremony  and other details  a common law marriage may be called  marriage by habit and repute  cohabitation    A de facto common law marriage without a license or ceremony is legally binding in some jurisdictions but has no legal consequence in others   7 4 3  Civil unions  A civil union  also referred to as a civil partnership  is a legally recognized form of partnership similar to marriage  Beginning with Denmark in 1989  civil unions under one name or another have been established by law in several countries in order to provide same sex couples rights  benefits  and responsibilities similar  in some countries  identical  to opposite sex civil marriage  In some jurisdictions  such as Brazil  New Zealand  Uruguay  Ecuador  France and the U S  states of Hawaii and Illinois  civil unions are also open to opposite sex couples   7 4 4   Marriage of convenience   Sometimes people marry to take advantage of a certain situation  sometimes called a marriage of convenience or a sham marriage  For example  according to one publisher of information about  green card  marriages   Every year over 450 000 United States citizens marry foreign born individuals and petition for them to obtain a permanent residency  Green Card  in the United States   While this is likely an overestimate  in 2003 alone 184 741 immigrants were admitted to the U S  as spouses of U S  citizens  More were admitted as fiancés of US citizens for the purpose of being married within 90 days  Regardless of the number of people entering the US to marry a US citizen  it does not indicate the number of these marriages that are convenience marriages  which number could include some of those with the motive of obtaining permanent residency  but also include people who are US citizens  One example would be to obtain an inheritance that has a marriage clause  Another example would be to save money on health insurance or to enter a health plan with preexisting conditions offered by the new spouse s employer  Other situations exist  and  in fact  all marriages have a complex combination of conveniences motivating the parties to marry  A marriage of convenience is one that is devoid of normal reasons to marry  In certain countries like Singapore sham marriages like these are punishable criminal offences   Some people want to marry a person with higher or lower status than them  Others want to marry people who have similar status  Hypergyny refers to the act of seeking out those who are of slightly higher social status  In most cases  hypergyny refers to women wanting men of higher status  Isogyny refers to the act of seeking out those who are of similar status   7 5  Contemporary legal and human rights criticisms of marriage  People have proposed arguments against marriage for reasons that include political  philosophical and religious criticisms  concerns about the divorce rate  individual liberty and gender equality  questioning the necessity of having a personal relationship sanctioned by government or religious authorities  or the promotion of celibacy for religious or philosophical reasons   7 5 1  Power and gender roles  Feminist theory approaches opposite sex marriage as an institution traditionally rooted in patriarchy that promotes male superiority and power over women  This power dynamic conceptualizes men as  the provider operating in the public sphere  and women as  the caregivers operating within the private sphere    Theoretically  women      were  defined as the property of their husbands      The adultery of a woman was always treated with more severity than that of a man     F eminist demands for a wife s control over her own property were not met  in parts of Britain  until      laws were passed in the late 19th century     Traditional marriage imposed an obligation of the wife to be sexually available for her husband and an obligation of the husband to provide material financial support for the wife  Numerous philosophers  feminists and other academic figures have commented on this throughout history  condemning the hypocrisy of legal and religious authorities in regard to sexual issues  pointing to the lack of choice of a woman in regard to controlling her own sexuality  and drawing parallels between marriage  an institution promoted as sacred  and prostitution  widely condemned and vilified  though often tolerated as a  necessary evil    Mary Wollstonecraft  in the 18th century  described marriage as  legal prostitution   Emma Goldman wrote in 1910   To the moralist prostitution does not consist so much in the fact that the woman sells her body  but rather that she sells it out of wedlock   Bertrand Russell in his book Marriage and Morals wrote that  Marriage is for woman the commonest mode of livelihood  and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in prostitution   Angela Carter in Nights at the Circus wrote   What is marriage but prostitution to one man instead of many    Some critics object to what they see as propaganda in relation to marriage – from the government  religious organizations  the media – which aggressively promote marriage as a solution for all social problems  such propaganda includes  for instance  marriage promotion in schools  where children  especially girls  are bombarded with positive information about marriage  being presented only with the information prepared by authorities   The performance of dominant gender roles by men and submissive gender roles by women influence the power dynamic of a marriage  In some American households  women internalize gender role stereotypes and often assimilate into the role of  wife    mother   and  caretaker  in conformity to societal norms and their male partner  Author bell hooks states  within the family structure  individuals learn to accept sexist oppression as  natural  and are primed to support other forms of oppression  including heterosexist domination     T he cultural  economic  political and legal supremacy of the husband  was   t raditional     under English law   This patriarchal dynamic is contrasted with a conception of egalitarian or Peer Marriage in which power and labour are divided equally  and not according to gender roles   In the US  studies have shown that  despite egalitarian ideals being common  less than half of respondents viewed their opposite sex relationships as equal in power  with unequal relationships being more commonly dominated by the male partner  Studies also show that married couples find the highest level of satisfaction in egalitarian relationships and lowest levels of satisfaction in wife dominate relationships  In recent years  egalitarian or Peer Marriages have been receiving increasing focus and attention politically  economically and culturally in a number of countries  including the United States   7 5 2  Sex outside of marriage  Different societies demonstrate variable tolerance of extramarital sex  The Standard Cross Cultural Sample describes the occurrence of extramarital sex by gender in over 50 pre industrial cultures  The occurrence of extramarital sex by men is described as  universal  in 6 cultures   moderate  in 29 cultures   occasional  in 6 cultures  and  uncommon  in 10 cultures  The occurrence of extramarital sex by women is described as  universal  in 6 cultures   moderate  in 23 cultures   occasional  in 9 cultures  and  uncommon  in 15 cultures  Three studies using nationally representative samples in the United States found that between 10–15% of women and 20–25% of men engage in extramarital sex   Many of the world s major religions look with disfavor on sexual relations outside marriage  There are non secular states that sanction criminal penalties for sexual intercourse before marriage  Sexual relations by a married person with someone other than his her spouse is known as adultery  Adultery is considered in many jurisdictions to be a crime and grounds for divorce   In some countries  such as Saudi Arabia  Pakistan  Afghanistan  Iran  Kuwait  Maldives  Morocco  Oman  Mauritania  United Arab Emirates  Sudan  Yemen  any form of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal   In some parts of the world  women and girls accused of having sexual relations outside marriage are at risk of becoming victims of honor killings committed by their families  In 2011 several people were sentenced to death by stoning after being accused of adultery in Iran  Somalia  Afghanistan  Sudan  Mali and Pakistan  Practices such as honor killings and stoning continue to be supported by mainstream politicians and other officials in some countries  In Pakistan  after the 2008 Balochistan honour killings in which five women were killed by tribesmen of the Umrani Tribe of Balochistan  Pakistani Federal Minister for Postal Services Israr Ullah Zehri defended the practice  he said   These are centuries old traditions  and I will continue to defend them  Only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid    7 5 3  Marriage and sexual violence  An issue that is a serious concern regarding marriage and which has been the object of international scrutiny is that of sexual violence within marriage  Throughout much of the history  in most cultures  sex in marriage was considered a  right   that could be taken by force  often by a man from a women   if  denied   As the concept of human rights started to develop in the 20th century  and with the arrival of second wave feminism  such views have become less widely held   The legal and social concept of marital rape has developed in most industrialized countries in the mid to late 20th century  in many other parts of the world it is not recognized as a form of abuse  socially or legally  Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made marital rape illegal before 1970  and other countries in Western Europe and the English speaking Western World outlawed it in the 1980s and 1990s  In England and Wales  marital rape was made illegal in 1991  Although marital rape is being increasingly criminalized in developing countries too  cultural  religious  and traditional ideologies about  conjugal rights  remain very strong in many parts of the world  and even in many countries that have adequate laws against rape in marriage these laws are rarely enforced   Apart from the issue of rape committed against one s spouse  marriage is  in many parts of the world  closely connected with other forms of sexual violence  in some places  like Morocco  unmarried girls and women who are raped are often forced by their families to marry their rapist  Because being the victim of rape and losing virginity carry extreme social stigma  and the victims are deemed to have their  reputation  tarnished  a marriage with the rapist is arranged  This is claimed to be in the advantage of both the victim – who does not remain unmarried and doesn t lose social status – and of the rapist  who avoids punishment  In 2012  after a Moroccan 16 year old girl committed suicide after having been forced by her family to marry her rapist and enduring further abuse by the rapist after they married  there have been protests from activists against this practice which is common in Morocco   In some societies  the very high social and religious importance of marital fidelity  especially female fidelity  has as result the criminalization of adultery  often with harsh penalties such as stoning or flogging  as well as leniency towards punishment of violence related to infidelity  such as honor killings   In the 21st century  criminal laws against adultery have become controversial with international organizations calling for their abolition  Opponents of adultery laws argue that these laws are a major contributor to discrimination and violence against women  as they are enforced selectively mostly against women  that they prevent women from reporting sexual violence  and that they maintain social norms which justify violent crimes committed against women by husbands  families and communities  A Joint Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice states that  Adultery as a criminal offence violates women s human rights   Some human rights organizations argue that the criminalization of adultery also violates internationally recognized protections for private life  as it represents an arbitrary interference with an individual s privacy  which is not permitted under international law   7 5 4  Marriage laws  human rights and the global status of women  The laws surrounding marriage in many countries have come under international scrutiny because they contradict international standards of human rights  institutionalize violence against women  child marriage and forced marriage  require the permission of a husband for his wife to work in a paid job  sign legal documents  file criminal charges against someone  sue in civil court etc   sanction the use by husbands of violence to  discipline  their wives  and discriminate against women in divorce   Such things were legal even in many Western countries until recently  for instance  in France  married women obtained the right to work without their husband s permission in 1965  and in West Germany women obtained this right in 1977  by comparison women in East Germany had much more rights   In Spain  during Franco s era  a married woman needed her husband s consent  referred to as the permiso marital  for almost all economic activities  including employment  ownership of property  and even traveling away from home  the permiso marital was abolished in 1975   An absolute submission of a wife to her husband is accepted as natural in many parts of the world  for instance surveys by UNICEF have shown that the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is as high as 90% in Afghanistan and Jordan  87% in Mali  86% in Guinea and Timor Leste  81% in Laos  80% in Central African Republic  Detailed results from Afghanistan show that 78 4% of women agree with a beating if the wife  goes out without telling him  the husband   and 76 2% agree  if she argues with him    In some countries of the world the laws go as far as allowing a husband to kill his wife  in certain circumstances  such as in case of adultery  In Haiti for instance  a husband has such a right  the criminal code excuses a husband who kills his wife or her lover if they are caught in his home  but a wife who kills her husband under similar circumstances is subject to criminal prosecution   7 5 5  Dowry and bridewealth  In recent years  the customs of dowry and bride price have received international criticism for inciting conflicts between families and clans  contributing to violence against women  promoting materialism  increasing property crimes  where men steal goods such as cattle in order to be able to pay the bride price   and making it difficult for poor people to marry  African women s rights campaigners advocate the abolishing of bride price  which they argue is based on the idea that women are a form of property which can be bought  Bride price has also been criticized for contributing to child trafficking as impoverished parents sell their young daughters to rich older men  A senior Papua New Guinea police officer has called for the abolishing of bride price arguing that it is one of the main reasons for the mistreatment of women in that country  The opposite practice of dowry has been linked to a high level of violence  see dowry deaths  and to crimes such as extortion   7 5 6  Children born outside marriage  Historically  and still in many countries  children born outside marriage suffered severe social stigma and discrimination  In England and Wales  such children were known as bastards and whoresons   There are significant differences between world regions in regard to the social and legal position of non marital births  ranging from being fully accepted and uncontroversial to being severely stigmatized and discriminated   The 1975 European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock protects the rights of children born to unmarried parents  The convention states  among others  that    The father and mother of a child born out of wedlock shall have the same obligation to maintain the child as if it were born in wedlock  and that  A child born out of wedlock shall have the same right of succession in the estate of its father and its mother and of a member of its father s or mother s family  as if it had been born in wedlock    While in most Western countries legal inequalities between children born inside and outside marriage have largely been abolished  this is not the case in some parts of the world   The legal status of an unmarried father differs greatly from country to country  Without voluntary formal recognition of the child by the father  in most cases there is a need of due process of law in order to establish paternity  In some countries however  unmarried cohabitation of a couple for a specific period of time does create a presumption of paternity similar to that of formal marriage  This is the case in Australia  Under what circumstances can a paternity action be initiated  the rights and responsibilities of a father once paternity has been established  whether he can obtain parental responsibility and weather he can be forced to support the child  as well as the legal position of a father who voluntarily acknowledges the child  vary widely by jurisdiction  A special situation arises when a married woman has a child by a man other than her husband  Some countries  such as Israel  refuse to accept a legal challenge of paternity in such a circumstance  in order to avoid the stigmatization of the child  see Mamzer  a concept under Jewish law   In 2010  the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman  granting him right of contact with the twins  despite the fact that the mother and her husband had forbidden him to see the children   The steps that an unmarried father must take in order to obtain rights to his child vary by country  In some countries  such as the UK – since 2003 in England and Wales  2006 in Scotland  and 2002 in Northern Ireland  it is sufficient for the father to be listed on the birth certificate for him to have parental rights  in other countries  such as Ireland  simply being listed on the birth certificate does not offer any rights  additional legal steps must be taken  if the mother agrees  the parents can both sign a  statutory declaration   but if the mother does not agree  the father has to apply to court    Children born outside marriage have become more common  and in some countries  the majority  Recent data from Latin America showed figures for non marital childbearing to be 74% for Colombia  69% for Peru  68% for Chile  66% for Brazil  58% for Argentina  55% for Mexico  In Europe  in 2011  the highest levels of extramarital births were found in Northern Europe and some countries of the former Communist Bloc  Iceland  65%   Estonia  59 7%   Slovenia  56 8%   Bulgaria  56 1%   Norway  55%   Sweden  54 2%   Data from 2011 showed that in that year  in the European Union  39 5% of births were to unmarried women  Greece had the lowest proportion of births outside marriage  at 7 4% in 2011  In the United States  in 2010  40 8% of births were to unmarried women  In the United Kingdom 47 3% of births were to unmarried women in 2011  in Ireland the figure was 33 7%   Some married couples choose not to have children  Others are unable to have children because of infertility or other factors preventing conception or the bearing of children  In some cultures  marriage imposes an obligation on women to bear children  In northern Ghana  for example  payment of bridewealth signifies a woman s requirement to bear children  and women using birth control face substantial threats of physical abuse and reprisals   7 5 7  Marriage privatization  Some minarchists  anarchists  libertarians  liberals and opponents of government interventionism propose that the state should have no authority to define the terms of personal relationships such as marriage  They claim that such relationships are best defined by private individuals   8  Marriage and religion  Among the precepts of mainstream religions are found  as a rule  unequivocal prescriptions for marriage  establishing both rituals and rules of conduct   8 1  Abrahamic religions  8 1 1  Bahá í  In the Bahá í Faith marriage is encouraged and viewed as a mutually strengthening bond  but is not obligatory  A Bahá í marriage requires the couple to choose each other  and then the consent of all living parents   8 1 2  Christianity  Christian marriages are based upon the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Apostle Paul  Today many Christian denominations regard marriage as a sacrament  a sacred institution  or a covenant  but this wasn t the case before marriage was officially recognized as a sacrament at the 1184 Council of Verona  Before then  no specific ritual was prescribed for celebrating a marriage   Marriage vows did not have to be exchanged in a church  nor was a priest s presence required  A couple could exchange consent anywhere  anytime    Christians often marry for religious reasons ranging from following the biblical injunction for a  man to leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife  and the two shall become one   to obeying Canon Law stating marriage between baptized persons is a sacrament   Divorce and remarriage while generally not encouraged are regarded differently by each Christian denomination  Most Protestant Churches allow people to marry again after a divorce  The Eastern Orthodox Church allows divorce for a limited number of reasons  and in theory  but usually not in practice  requires that a marriage after divorce be celebrated with a penitential overtone  In the Roman Catholic Church  marriage can be ended by an annulment where the Church for special reasons regards it as never having taken place   Catholics  Eastern Orthodox Christians and many Anglicans consider marriage termed holy matrimony to be an expression of divine grace  termed a sacrament or mystery  In Western ritual  the ministers of the sacrament are the husband and wife themselves  with a bishop  priest  or deacon merely witnessing the union on behalf of the church  and adding a blessing  In Eastern ritual churches  the bishop or priest functions as the actual minister of the Sacred Mystery  Eastern Orthodox deacons may not perform marriages   Western Christians commonly refer to marriage as a vocation  while Eastern Christians consider it an ordination and a martyrdom  though the theological emphases indicated by the various names are not excluded by the teachings of either tradition  Marriage is commonly celebrated in the context of a Eucharistic service  a nuptial Mass or Divine Liturgy   The sacrament of marriage is indicative of the relationship between Christ and the Church   The Roman Catholic tradition of the 12th and 13th centuries defined marriage as a sacrament ordained by God  signifying the mystical marriage of Christ to his Church    The matrimonial covenant  by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life  is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring  this covenant between baptized persons has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament   The mutual love between man and wife becomes an image of the eternal love with which God loves humankind  The celebration of marriage between two Catholics normally takes place during the public liturgical celebration of the Holy Mass  because of its sacramental connection with the unity of the Paschal mystery of Christ  Communion   Sacramental marriage confers a perpetual and exclusive bond between the spouses  By its nature  the institution of marriage and conjugal love is ordered to the procreation and upbringing of offspring  Marriage creates rights and duties in the Church between the spouses and towards their children    e ntering marriage with the intention of never having children is a grave wrong and more than likely grounds for an annulment   According to current Catholic legislation governing marriage  the essential properties of marriage are unity and indissolubility  in Christian marriage they acquire a distinctive firmness by reason of the sacrament  Divorce is not recognized  but annulments predicated upon previously existing impediments may be granted  Offspring resulting from annulled relationships are considered legitimate  Remarried persons divorced from a living  lawful spouse are not separated from the Church  but they cannot receive Eucharistic communion   For Protestant denominations  the purposes of marriage include intimate companionship  rearing children and mutual support for both husband and wife to fulfill their life callings  Protestants are generally not opposed to the use of birth control and consider marital sexual pleasure to be a gift of God   Most Reformed Christians would deny the elevation of marriage to the status of a sacrament  nevertheless it is considered a covenant between spouses before God cf  Since the sixteenth century  five competing models of marriage in have shaped Protestant marriage and legal tradition   The Protestant Reformationists replaced the Roman Catholic sacramental model   Martin Luther saw it as a social  estate of the earthly kingdom   subject to the prince  not the Pope    John Calvin taught that marriage was a covenant of grace that required the coercive power of the state to preserve its integrity   Anglicans regarded marriage as a domestic commonwealth within England and the church  By the 17th century  Anglican theologians had begun to develop a theology of marriage to replace the sacramental model of marriage  These  regarded the interlocking commonwealths of state  church  and family as something of an earthly form of heavenly government    The secularism of the Enlightenment emphasized marriage as a contract  to be formed  maintained  and dissolved as the couple sees fit   Once the process of marriage was secularized into a private contract  the role of churches substantially diminished for Protestants  This culminated in the second half of the 20th century with nearly all Protestants permitting divorce and remarriage   Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  LDS Church  believe that  marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator s plan for the eternal destiny of His children   The LDS belief is that marriage between a man and a woman can last beyond death and into eternity   8 1 2 1  Christian attitudes to same sex marriage  While most Christian denominations do not currently perform same sex marriages  some do  such as Unitarian Universalist  Metropolitan Community Church  Quaker  United Church of Canada  and United Church of Christ congregations  and some Anglican dioceses  for example  Same sex marriage is recognized by various religious denominations   8 1 3  Islam  Islam also commends marriage  with the age of marriage being whenever the individuals feel ready  financially and emotionally   In Islam  polygyny is allowed while polyandry is not  with the specific limitation that a man can have no more than four legal wives at any one time and an unlimited number of female slaves as concubines  with the requirement that the man is able and willing to partition his time and wealth equally among the respective wives   For a Muslim wedding to take place  the bridegroom and the guardian of the bride  wali  must both agree on the marriage  Should the guardian disagree on the marriage  it may not legally take place  If the wali of the girl her father or paternal grandfather  he has the right to force her into marriage even against her proclaimed will  if it is her first marriage  A guardian who is allowed to force the bride into marriage is called wali mujbir   From an Islamic  Sharia  law perspective  the minimum requirements and responsibilities in a Muslim marriage are that the groom provide living expenses  housing  clothing  food  maintenance  to the bride  and in return  the bride s main responsibility is raising children to be proper Muslims  All other rights and responsibilities are to be decided between the husband and wife  and may even be included as stipulations in the marriage contract before the marriage actually takes place  so long as they do not go against the minimum requirements of the marriage   In Sunni Islam and Ahmadiyya Islam  marriage must take place in the presence of at least two reliable witnesses  with the consent of the guardian of the bride and the consent of the groom  Following the marriage  the couple may consummate the marriage  To create an  urf marriage  it is sufficient that a man and a woman indicate an intention to marry each other and recite the requisite words in front of a suitable Muslim  The wedding party usually follows but can be held days  or months later  whenever the couple and their families want to  however there can be no concealment of the marriage as it is regarded as public notification due to the requirement of witnesses   In Shia Islam  marriage may take place without the presence of witnesses as is often the case in temporary mut ah marriage  prohibited in Sunni Islam   but with the consent of both the bride and the groom  Following the marriage they may consummate their marriage   8 1 4  Judaism  In Judaism  marriage is based on the laws of the Torah and is a contractual bond between a man and a woman in which the woman dedicates herself to be the exclusive woman of a single man  This contract is called Kiddushin  Though procreation is not the sole purpose  a Jewish marriage is also expected to fulfill the commandment to have children  The main focus centers around the relationship between the husband and wife  Kabbalistically  marriage is understood to mean that the husband and wife are merging into a single soul  This is why a man is considered  incomplete  if he is not married  as his soul is only one part of a larger whole that remains to be unified   The Hebrew Bible  Christian Old Testament  describes a number of marriages  including those of Isaac     Jacob   and Samson     Polygyny  or men having multiple wives at once  is one of the most common marital arrangements represented in the Hebrew Bible  Today Ashkenazi Jews are prohibited to take more than one wife because of a ban instituted on this by Gershom ben Judah  Died 1040    Betrothal  erusin   which refers to the time that this binding contract is made  is distinct from marriage itself  nissu in   with the time between these events varying substantially  In biblical times  a wife was regarded as chattel  belonging to her husband  the descriptions of the Bible suggest that she would be expected to perform tasks such as spinning  sewing  weaving  manufacture of clothing  fetching of water  baking of bread  and animal husbandry  However  wives were usually looked after with care  and men with more than one wife were expected to ensure that they continue to give the first wife food  clothing  and marital rights   Since a wife was regarded as property  her husband was originally free to divorce her for any reason  at any time  Divorcing a woman against her will was also banned by Gershom ben Judah  A divorced couple were permitted to get back together  unless the wife had married someone else after her divorce   8 2  Hinduism  Hinduism sees marriage as a sacred duty that entails both religious and social obligations  Old Hindu literature in Sanskrit gives many different types of marriages and their categorization ranging from  Gandharva Vivaha   instant marriage by mutual consent of participants only  without any need for even a single third person as witness  to normal  present day  marriages  to  Rakshasa Vivaha    demoniac  marriage  performed by abduction of one participant by the other participant  usually  but not always  with the help of other persons   In India and generally in South Asia  arranged marriages  the spouse s parents or an older family member choose the partner  are still predominant in comparison with so called love marriages until nowadays  The Hindu Widow s Remarriage Act 1856 empowers a Hindu widow to remarry   Sati  the practice of a widow immolating herself on her husband s funeral pyre  was officially outlawed by India s British rulers in 1829  The last sati incident allegedly ouccured in Rajasthan in 1987 when 18 year old Roop Kanwar allegedly committed sati  A court order ruled in 2004 that no such incident had occurred and acquitted all accused   8 3  Buddhism  The Buddhist view of marriage considers marriage a secular affair and thus not a sacrament  Buddhists are expected to follow the civil laws regarding marriage laid out by their respective governments  Gautama Buddha  being a kshatriya was required by Shakyan tradition to pass a series of tests to prove himself as a warrior  before he was allowed to marry   8 4  Sikhism  In a Sikh marriage  the couple walks around the Guru Granth Sahib holy book four times  and a holy man recites from it in the kirtan style  The ceremony is known as  Anand Karaj  and represents the holy union of two souls united as one   8 5  Wicca  Wiccan marriages are commonly known as handfastings  Although handfastings vary for each Wiccan they often involve honoring Wiccan gods  Sex is considered a pious and sacred activity   9  Marriage and health  Marriage  like other close relationships  exerts considerable influence on health  Married people experience lower morbidity and mortality across such diverse health threats as cancer  heart attacks  and surgery  Research on marriage and health is part of the broader study of the benefits of social relationships  Social ties provide people with a sense of identity  purpose  belonging and support  Simply being married  as well has the quality of one s marriage  has been linked to diverse measures of health   The health protective effect of marriage is stronger for men than women  Marital status — the simple fact of being married — confers more health benefits to men than women  Women s health is more strongly impacted than men s by marital conflict or satisfaction  such that unhappily married women do not enjoy better health relative to their single counterparts  Most research on marriage and health has focused on heterosexual couples  and more work is needed to clarify the health impacts of same sex marriage   10  Divorce  In most societies  the death of one of the partners terminates the marriage  and in monogamous societies this allows the other partner to remarry  though sometimes after a waiting or mourning period   In some societies  a marriages can be annulled  when an authority declares that a marriage never happened   A marriage may also be terminated through divorce  As of 2012  the Philippines and the Vatican City are the only jurisdictions which do not allow divorce  this is currently under discussion in Philippines    After divorce  one spouse may have to pay alimony  Laws concerning divorce and the ease with which a divorce can be obtained vary widely around the world  After a divorce or an annulment  the people concerned are free to remarry  or marry    A statutory right of two married partners to mutually consent to divorce was enacted in western nations in the mid 20th century  In the United States no fault divorce was first enacted in California in 1969 and the final state to legalize it was New York in 1989   About 45% of marriages in Britain and  according to a 2009 study  46% of marriages in the U S  end in divorce   11  History of marriage  11 1  Ancient world  Many cultures have legends concerning the origins of marriage  The way in which a marriage is conducted and its rules and ramifications has changed over time  as has the institution itself  depending on the culture or demographic of the time   A wife was seen as being of high value  and was therefore  usually  carefully looked after  Early nomadic communities in the middle east practised a form of marriage known as beena  in which a wife would own a tent of her own  within which she retains complete independence from her husband  this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society  as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession  specifically  Jael  Sarah  and Jacob s wives   In later times  the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room s  of the husband s house  as her own private area to which men were not permitted  in the case of wealthy husbands  the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose   It was not  however  a life of complete freedom  The descriptions of the Bible suggest that a wife was expected to perform certain household tasks  spinning  sewing  weaving  manufacture of clothing  fetching of water  baking of bread  and animal husbandry  The Book of Proverbs contains an entire acrostic about the duties which would be performed by a virtuous wife   The husband too  is indirectly implied to have some responsibilities to his wife  The Covenant Code orders men who have two wives  polygynously  to not deprive the first wife of food  of clothing  nor of sexual activity  if the husband does not provide the first wife with these things  she is to be divorced  without cost to her  The Talmud interprets this as a requirement for a man to provide food and clothing to  and have sex with  each of his wives   As a polygynous society  the Israelites did not have any laws which imposed marital fidelity on men  However  the prophet Malachi states that none should be faithless to the wife of his youth and that God hates divorce  Adulterous married women and adulterous betrothed women  however  were subject to the death penalty by the biblical laws against adultery  as were men who slept with married women  According to the Priestly Code of the Book of Numbers  if a pregnant woman was suspected of adultery  she was to be subjected to the Ordeal of Bitter Water  a form of trial by ordeal  but one that took a miracle to convict  The literary prophets indicate that adultery was a frequent occurrence  despite their strong protests against it  and these legal strictnesses   In Ancient Greece  no specific civil ceremony was required for the creation of a marriage – only mutual agreement and the fact that the couple must regard each other as husband and wife accordingly  Men usually married when they were in their 20s and women in their teens  It has been suggested that these ages made sense for the Greeks because men were generally done with military service or financially established by their late 20s  and marrying a young girl ensured ample time for her to bear children  as life expectancies were significantly lower during this period  Married Greek women had few rights in ancient Greek society and were expected to take care of the house and children  Time was an important factor in Greek marriage  For example  there were superstitions that being married during a full moon was good luck and  according to Robert Flacelière  Greeks married in the winter  Inheritance was more important than feelings  a woman whose father dies without male heirs could be forced to marry her nearest male relative – even if she had to divorce her husband first   There were several types of marriages in ancient Roman society  The traditional   conventional   form called conventio in manum required a ceremony with witnesses and was also dissolved with a ceremony  In this type of marriage  a woman lost her family rights of inheritance of her old family and gained them with her new one  She now was subject to the authority of her husband  There was the free marriage known as sine manu  In this arrangement  the wife remained a member of her original family  she stayed under the authority of her father  kept her family rights of inheritance with her old family and did not gain any with the new family  The minimum age of marriage for girls was 12   Among ancient Germanic tribes  the bride and groom were roughly the same age and generally older than their Roman counterparts  according to Tacitus   The youths partake late of the pleasures of love  and hence pass the age of puberty unexhausted  nor are the virgins hurried into marriage  the same maturity  the same full growth is required  the sexes unite equally matched and robust  and the children inherit the vigor of their parents  Where Aristotle had set the prime of life at 37 years for men and 18 for women  the Visigothic Code of law in the 7th century placed the prime of life at twenty years for both men and women  after which both presumably married  Tacitus states that ancient Germanic brides were on average about 20 and were roughly the same age as their husbands   11 2  Europe  From the early Christian era  30 to 325 CE   marriage was thought of as primarily a private matter  with no uniform religious or other ceremony being required  However  bishop Ignatius of Antioch writing around 110 to bishop Polycarp of Smyrna exhorts    I t becomes both men and women who marry  to form their union with the approval of the bishop  that their marriage may be according to God  and not after their own lust    In the 12th century  women were obligated to take the name of their husbands and starting in the second half of the 16th century parental consent along with the church s consent was required for marriage   With few local exceptions  until 1545  Christian marriages in Europe were by mutual consent  declaration of intention to marry and upon the subsequent physical union of the parties  The couple would promise verbally to each other that they would be married to each other  the presence of a priest or witnesses was not required  This promise was known as the  verbum   If freely given and made in the present tense  e g    I marry you    it was unquestionably binding  if made in the future tense   I will marry you    it would constitute a betrothal   In 1552 a wedding took place in Zufia  Navarre  between Diego de Zufia and Mari Miguel following the custom as it was in the realm since the Middle Ages  but the man denounced the marriage on the grounds that its validity was conditioned to  riding  her   si te cabalgo  lo cual dixo de bascuence       balvin yo baneça aren senar içateko    The tribunal of the kingdom rejected the husband s claim  validating the wedding  but the husband appealed to the tribunal in Zaragoza  and this institution annulled the marriage  According to the Charter of Navarre  the basic union consisted of a civil marriage with no priest required and at least two witnesses  and the contract could be broken using the same formula  The Church in turn lashed out at those who got married twice or thrice in a row while their formers spouses were still alive  In 1563 the Council of Trent  twenty fourth session  required that a valid marriage must be performed by a priest before two witnesses   One of the functions of churches from the Middle Ages was to register marriages  which was not obligatory  There was no state involvement in marriage and personal status  with these issues being adjudicated in ecclesiastical courts  During the Middle Ages marriages were arranged  sometimes as early as birth  and these early pledges to marry were often used to ensure treaties between different royal families  nobles  and heirs of fiefdoms  The church resisted these imposed unions  and increased the number of causes for nullification of these arrangements  As Christianity spread during the Roman period and the Middle Ages  the idea of free choice in selecting marriage partners increased and spread with it   In Medieval Western Europe  later marriage and higher rates of definitive celibacy  the so called  European marriage pattern   helped to constrain patriarchy at its most extreme level  For example  Medieval England saw marriage age as variable depending on economic circumstances  with couples delaying marriage until the early twenties when times were bad and falling to the late teens after the Black Death  when there were labor shortages  by appearances  marriage of adolescents was not the norm in England  Where the strong influence of classical Celtic and Germanic cultures  which were not rigidly patriarchal  helped to offset the Judaeo Roman patriarchal influence  in Eastern Europe the tradition of early and universal marriage  often in early adolescence  as well as traditional Slavic patrilocal custom led to a greatly inferior status of women at all levels of society   The average age of marriage for most of Northwestern Europe from 1500 to 1800 was around 25 years of age  as the Church dictated that both parties had to be at least 21 years of age to marry without the consent of their parents  the bride and groom were roughly the same age  with most brides in their early twenties and most grooms two or three years older  and a substantial number of women married for the first time in their thirties and forties  particularly in urban areas  with the average age at first marriage rising and falling as circumstances dictated  In better times  more people could afford to marry earlier and thus fertility rose and conversely marriages were delayed or foregone when times were bad  thus restricting family size  after the Black Death  the greater availability of profitable jobs allowed more people to marry young and have more children  but the stabilization of the population in the 16th century meant less job opportunities and thus more people delaying marriages   As part of the Protestant Reformation  the role of recording marriages and setting the rules for marriage passed to the state  reflecting Martin Luther s view that marriage was a  worldly thing   By the 17th century  many of the Protestant European countries had a state involvement in marriage   In England  under the Anglican Church  marriage by consent and cohabitation was valid until the passage of Lord Hardwicke s Act in 1753  This act instituted certain requirements for marriage  including the performance of a religious ceremony observed by witnesses   As part of the Counter Reformation  in 1563 the Council of Trent decreed that a Roman Catholic marriage would be recognized only if the marriage ceremony was officiated by a priest with two witnesses  The Council also authorized a Catechism  issued in 1566  which defined marriage as   The conjugal union of man and woman  contracted between two qualified persons  which obliges them to live together throughout life    In the early modern period  John Calvin and his Protestant colleagues reformulated Christian marriage by enacting the Marriage Ordinance of Geneva  which imposed  The dual requirements of state registration and church consecration to constitute marriage  for recognition   In England and Wales  Lord Hardwicke s Marriage Act 1753 required a formal ceremony of marriage  thereby curtailing the practice of Fleet Marriage  an irregular or a clandestine marriage  These were clandestine or irregular marriages performed at Fleet Prison  and at hundreds of other places  From the 1690s until the Marriage Act of 1753 as many as 300 000 clandestine marriages were performed at Fleet Prison alone  The Act required a marriage ceremony to be officiated by an Anglican priest in the Anglican Church with two witnesses and registration  The Act did not apply to Jewish marriages or those of Quakers  whose marriages continued to be governed by their own customs   In England and Wales  since 1837  civil marriages have been recognized as a legal alternative to church marriages under the Marriage Act 1836  In Germany  civil marriages were recognized in 1875  This law permitted a declaration of the marriage before an official clerk of the civil administration  when both spouses affirm their will to marry  to constitute a legally recognized valid and effective marriage  and allowed an optional private clerical marriage ceremony   In contemporary English common law  a marriage is a voluntary contract by a man and a woman  in which by agreement they choose to become husband and wife  Edvard Westermarck proposed that  the institution of marriage has probably developed out of a primeval habit    As of 2000  the average marriage age range was 25–44 years for men and 22–39 years for women   11 3  China  The mythological origin of Chinese marriage is a story about Nüwa and Fu Xi who invented proper marriage procedures after becoming married  In ancient Chinese society  people of the same surname are supposed to consult with their family trees prior marriage to reduce the potential risk of unintentional incest  Marriaging to one s maternal relatives was generally not thought of as incest  families sometimes intermarried from one generation to another  Over time  Chinese people became more geographically mobile  Individuals remained members of their biological families  When a couple died  the husband and the wife were buried separately in the respective clans  graveyard  In a maternal marriage  a male would become a son in law who lived in the wife s home   The New Marriage Law of 1950 radically changed Chinese marriage traditions  enforcing monogamy  equality of men and women  and choice in marriage  arranged marriages were the most common type of marriage in China until then  Starting October 2003  it became legal to marry or divorce without authorization from the couple s work units  Although people with infectious diseases such as AIDS may now marry  marriage is still illegal for the mentally ill   12  References  13
