Zora Neale Hurston  January 7  1891 – January 28  1960  was an American folklorist  anthropologist  and author  Of Hurston s four novels and more than 50 published short stories  plays  and essays  she is best known for her 1937 novel Their Eyes Were Watching God   In addition to new editions of her work being published after a revival of interest in her in 1975  her manuscript Every Tongue Got to Confess  2001   a collection of folktales gathered in the 1920s  was published posthumously after being discovered in the Smithsonian archives   1  Biography  1 1  Early life  Hurston was the fifth of eight children of John Hurston and Lucy Ann Hurston  née Potts   Her father was a Baptist preacher  tenant farmer  and carpenter  and her mother was a school teacher  She was born in Notasulga  Alabama  on January 7  1891  where her father grew up and her grandfather was the preacher of a Baptist church   When she was three  her family moved to Eatonville  Florida  in 1887 it was one of the first all black towns to be incorporated in the United States  Hurston said she always felt that Eatonville was  home  to her as she grew up there  and sometimes she claimed it as her birthplace  Her father later was elected as mayor of the town in 1897 and in 1902 became preacher of its largest church  Macedonia Missionary Baptist   Hurston later glorified Eatonville in her stories as a place where African Americans could live as they desired  independent of white society  In 1901  some northern schoolteachers visited Eatonville and gave Hurston a number of books that opened her mind to literature  she described it as a kind of  birth   Hurston spent the remainder of her childhood in Eatonville  and describes the experience of growing up there in her 1928 essay   How It Feels to Be Colored Me    In 1904  Hurston s mother died  Her father remarried to Matte Moge almost immediately  this was considered a minor scandal  as it was rumored that he had had relations with Moge before his first wife s death  Hurston s father and stepmother sent her away to a Baptist boarding school in Jacksonville  Florida  They eventually stopped paying her tuition and the school expelled her  She later worked as a maid to the lead singer in a traveling Gilbert & Sullivan theatrical company   In 1917  Hurston began attending Morgan College  the high school division of Morgan State University  a historically black college in Baltimore  Maryland  At this time  apparently to qualify for a free high school education  as well  perhaps to reflect her literary birth   the 26 year old Hurston began claiming 1901 as her year of birth  She graduated from the high school of Morgan State University in 1918   1 2  College  In 1918  Hurston began undergraduate studies at Howard University  where she became one of the earliest initiates of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority and co founded The Hilltop  the university s student newspaper  While there  she took courses in Spanish  English  Greek and public speaking and earned an associate s degree in 1920  In 1921  she wrote a short story  John Redding Goes to Sea  which qualified her to become a member of Alaine Locke s literary club  The Stylus  Hurston left Howard in 1924 and in 1925 was offered a scholarship by Barnard trustee Annie Nathan Meyer to Barnard College  Columbia University  where she was the college s sole black student  Hurston received her B A  in anthropology in 1928  when she was 37  While she was at Barnard  she conducted ethnographic research with noted anthropologist Franz Boas of Columbia University  She also worked with Ruth Benedict as well as fellow anthropology student Margaret Mead  After graduating from Barnard  Hurston spent two years as a graduate student in anthropology at Columbia University   1 3  Adulthood  In 1927  Hurston married Herbert Sheen  a jazz musician and former classmate at Howard who later became a physician  Their marriage ended in 1931  In 1939  while Hurston was working for the WPA  she married Albert Price  who was 25 years younger than she  this marriage ended after only seven months   She lived in a cottage in Eau Gallie  Florida  twice  once in 1929 and again in 1951  During the 1930s  Hurston was a resident of Westfield  New Jersey  where Langston Hughes was among her neighbors  In 1934 she established a school of dramatic arts  based on pure Negro expression  at Bethune Cookman University  at the time  Bethune Cookman College   a historically black college in Daytona Beach  Florida   In later life  in addition to continuing her literary career  Hurston served on the faculty of North Carolina College for Negroes  now North Carolina Central University  in Durham  North Carolina   2  Legacy and honors  In 1956 Hurston received the Bethune Cookman College Award for Education and Human Relations in recognition of her achievements  The English Department at Bethune Cookman College remains dedicated to preserving her cultural legacy   2 1  Anthropological and folkloric fieldwork  Hurston traveled extensively in the Caribbean and the American South and immersed herself in local cultural practices to conduct her anthropological research  Based on her work in the South  sponsored from 1928 to 1932 by Charlotte Osgood Mason  a wealthy philanthropist  Hurston wrote Mules and Men in 1935  She was doing research in lumber camps and commented on the practice of white men in power taking black women as sexual concubines  including having them bear children  This later was referred to as  paramour rights   based in the men s power under racial and related to practices during slavery times  The book also includes much folklore  She used this material as well in fictional treatment developed for her novels such as Jonah s Gourd Vine  1934    In 1936 and 1937  Hurston traveled to Jamaica and Haiti for research  with support from the Guggenheim Foundation  She drew from this for her anthropological work  Tell My Horse  1938    From October 1947 to February 1948  she lived in Honduras  at the north coastal town of Puerto Cortés  She had some hopes of locating either Mayan ruins or vestiges of an as yet undiscovered civilization  While in Puerto Cortés  she wrote much of Seraph on the Suwanee  set in Florida  Hurston expressed interest in the polyethnic nature of the population in the region  many  such as the Miskito Zambu and Garifuna  were of partial African ancestry and had developed creole cultures    2 2  Later years  In 1948  Hurston was falsely accused of molesting a ten year old boy  Although the case was dismissed after Hurston presented evidence that she was in Honduras when the crime supposedly occurred in the U S   her personal life was seriously disrupted by the scandal   During her last decade  Hurston worked as a freelance writer for magazines and newspapers  In the fall of 1952 she was contacted by Sam Nunn  editor of the Pittsburgh Courier  to go to Florida to cover the murder trial of Ruby McCollum  The wealthy black married woman was charged with murdering a prominent white doctor and politician  also married  whom McCollum said had forced her to have sex and bear his child  Hurston recalled what she had seen of white male sexual dominance in the lumber camps in North Florida  and discussed it with Nunn  They both thought the case might be about such  paramour rights   and wanted to  expose it to a national audience    Upon reaching Live Oak  Hurston was surprised not only by the gag order the judge in the trial placed on the defense  but by her inability to get residents in town to talk about the case  both blacks and whites were silent  She believed that might have been related to Dr  Adams  alleged involvement as well in Sam McCollum s gambling operation  Her articles were published by the newspaper during the trial  Ruby McCollum was convicted by an all white  all male jury  and sentenced to death  Hurston had a special assignment to write a serialized account  The Life Story of Ruby McCollum  over three months in 1953 in the newspaper  Her part was ended abruptly when she and Nunn disagreed about her pay  and she left   Unable to pay independently to return for the appeal and second trial  she contacted journalist William Bradford Huie  with whom she had worked at The American Mercury  to try to interest him in the case  He covered the appeal and second trial  and also developed material from a background investigation  Hurston shared her material with him from the first trial  but he acknowledged her only briefly in his book  Ruby McCollum  Woman in the Suwannee Jail  1956   which became a bestseller  Hurston celebrated that  McCollum’s testimony in her own defense marked the first time that a woman of African American descent was allowed to testify as to the paternity of her child by a white man  Hurston firmly believed that Ruby McCollum’s testimony sounded the death toll of  paramour rights  in the Segregationist South    Among other positions  Hurston later worked at the Pan American World Airways Technical Library at Patrick Air Force Base in 1957  She was fired for being  too well educated  for her job   She moved to Fort Pierce  Taking jobs where she could find them  she worked as a substitute teacher and as a maid   2 3  Death  During a period of financial and medical difficulties  Hurston was forced to enter St  Lucie County Welfare Home  where she suffered a stroke  She died of hypertensive heart disease on January 28  1960  and was buried at the Garden of Heavenly Rest in Fort Pierce  Florida  Her remains were in an unmarked grave until 1973  Novelist Alice Walker and literary scholar Charlotte Hunt found an unmarked grave in the general area where Hurston had been buried  and decided to mark it as hers   After Hurston died on January 28  1960 in a Fort Pierce  Florida  hospital  her papers were ordered to be burned  A law officer and friend  Patrick DuVal  passing by the house where she had lived  stopped and put out the fire  thus saving an invaluable collection of literary documents for posterity  The nucleus of this collection was given to the University of Florida libraries in 1961 by Mrs  Marjorie Silver  friend and neighbor of Hurston  Other materials were donated in 1970 and 1971 by Frances Grover  daughter of E  O  Grover  a Rollins College professor and long time friend of Hurston s  In 1979 Stetson Kennedy of Jacksonville  who knew Hurston through his work with the Federal Writers Project  added additional papers    Zora Neal Hurston Papers  University of Florida Smathers Libraries  August 2008    3  Literary career  3 1  1920s  When Hurston arrived in New York City in 1925  the Harlem Renaissance was at its peak  and she soon became one of the writers at its center  Shortly before she entered Barnard  Hurston s short story “Spunk” was selected for The New Negro  a landmark anthology of fiction  poetry  and essays focusing on African and African American art and literature  In 1926  a group of young black writers including Hurston  Langston Hughes  and Wallace Thurman  calling themselves the Niggerati  produced a literary magazine called Fire   that featured many of the young artists and writers of the Harlem Renaissance  In 1929  Hurston moved to Eau Gallie in Florida where she wrote Mules and Men  which was later published in 1935   3 2  1930s  By the mid 1930s  Hurston had published several short stories and the critically acclaimed Mules and Men  1935   a groundbreaking work of  literary anthropology  documenting African American folklore from timber camps in North Florida  In 1930  she collaborated with Langston Hughes on Mule Bone  A Comedy of Negro Life in Three Acts  a play that they never finished  It was published posthumously in 1991   In 1937  Hurston was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship to conduct ethnographic research in Jamaica and Haiti  Tell My Horse  1938  documents her account of her fieldwork studying spiritual and cultural rituals in Jamaica and vodoun in Haiti  Hurston also translated her anthropological work into the performing arts  and her folk revue  The Great Day  premiered at the John Golden Theatre in New York in 1932   Hurston s first three novels were published in the 1930s  Jonah s Gourd Vine  1934   Their Eyes Were Watching God  1937   written during her fieldwork in Haiti and considered her masterwork  and Moses  Man of the Mountain  1939    3 3  1940s and 1950s  In the 1940s  Hurston s work was published in such periodicals as The American Mercury and The Saturday Evening Post  Her last published novel  Seraph on the Suwanee  notable principally for its focus on white characters  was published in 1948  It explores images of  white trash  women  Jackson  2000  argues that Hurston s meditation on abjection  waste  and the construction of class and gender identities among poor whites reflects the eugenics discourses of the 1920s   In 1952  Hurston was assigned by the Pittsburgh Courier to cover the small town murder trial of Ruby McCollum  the prosperous black wife of the local bolita racketeer  who had killed a racist white doctor  She also contributed to Woman in the Suwannee County Jail  a book by journalist and civil rights advocate William Bradford Huie  In 2008  The Library of America selected excerpts from this work for inclusion in its two century retrospective of American True Crime writing   3 4  Public obscurity  Hurston s work slid into obscurity for decades  for a number of cultural and political reasons   Many readers objected to the representation of African American dialect in Hurston s novels  given the racially charged history of dialect fiction in American literature  Her stylistic choices in terms of dialogue were influenced by her academic experiences  Thinking like a folklorist  Hurston strove to represent speech patterns of the period which she documented through ethnographic research  For example  a character in Jonah s Gourd Vine expresses herself in this manner   Several of Hurston s literary contemporaries criticized Hurston s use of dialect as a caricature of African American culture rooted in a racist tradition  In particular  a number of writers associated with the Harlem Renaissance were critical of Hurston s later writings  on the basis that they did not agree with or further the position of the overall movement  One particular criticism came from Richard Wright in his review of Their Eyes Were Watching God   More recently  many critics have praised Hurston s skillful use of idiomatic speech   During the 1930s and 1940s when her work was published  the pre eminent African American author was Richard Wright  Unlike Hurston  Wright wrote in explicitly political terms  as someone who had become disenchanted with communism  using the struggle of African Americans for respect and economic advancement as both the setting and the motivation for his work  Other popular African American authors of the time  such as Ralph Ellison  dealt with the same concerns as Wright  Hurston s work  which did not engage these political issues  did not fit in with this struggle  In 1951  for example  Hurston argued that New Deal economic support created a harmful dependency by African Americans on the government  and that this dependency ceded too much power to politicians   3 5  Posthumous recognition  Author Alice Walker sought Hurston s grave in 1973 and planted a grave marker calling her  A Genius of the South   Walker then published  In Search of Zora Neale Hurston  in the March 1975 issue of Ms  magazine  reviving interest in Hurston s work  The renewal of attention to Hurston was related also to the rise of new African American authors such as Maya Angelou  Toni Morrison  and Walker  whose works are centered on African American experiences and include  but do not necessarily focus upon  racial struggle   Zora Neale Hurston s hometown of Eatonville  Florida  celebrates her life in an annual festival and is home to the Zora Neale Hurston Museum of Fine Arts  named in her honor  Her life and legacy are celebrated every year here at the    Hurston s house in Fort Pierce has been designated a National Historic Landmark  The city celebrates Hurston annually through various events such as Hattitudes  birthday parties  and a several day festival at the end of April known as    In 2002  scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Zora Neale Hurston on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans   Barnard College dedicated its 2003 Virginia C  Gildersleeve Conference to Hurston   Jumpin’ at the Sun  Reassessing the Life and Work of Zora Neale Hurston  focused on her work and influence  Alice Walker s Gildersleeve lecture detailed her work on discovering and publicizing Hurston s legacy   She was inducted as a member of the inaugural class of the New York Writers Hall of Fame in 2010   On January 7  2014  the 123rd anniversary of Hurston s birthday was commemorated by a Google Doodle   4  Politics  John McWhorter has called Hurston  America s favorite black conservative  while David T  Beito and Linda Royster Beito have argued that she can better be characterized as a  libertarian   She was a Republican who was generally sympathetic to the foreign policy non interventionism of the Old Right and a fan of Booker T  Washington s self help politics  She disagreed with the philosophies  including Communism and the New Deal  supported by many of her colleagues in the Harlem Renaissance  such as Langston Hughes  who was in the 1930s a supporter of the Soviet Union and praised it in several of his poems  Despite much common ground with the Old Right in domestic and foreign policy  Hurston was not a social conservative  Her writings show an affinity for feminist individualism  In this respect  her views were similar to two libertarian novelists who were her contemporaries  Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson  Although her personal quotes show a disbelief of religion  Hurston did not negate spiritual matters as evidenced from her 1942 autobiography Dust Tracks on a Road   Prayer seems to me a cry of weakness  and an attempt to avoid  by trickery  the rules of the game as laid down  I do not choose to admit weakness  I accept the challenge of responsibility  Life  as it is  does not frighten me  since I have made my peace with the universe as I find it  and bow to its laws  The ever sleepless sea in its bed  crying out “how long ” to Time  million formed and never motionless flame  the contemplation of these two aspects alone  affords me sufficient food for ten spans of my expected lifetime  It seems to me that organized creeds are collections of words around a wish  I feel no need for such  However  I would not  by word or deed  attempt to deprive another of the consolation it affords  It is simply not for me  Somebody else may have my rapturous glance at the archangels  The springing of the yellow line of morning out of the misty deep of dawn  is glory enough for me  I know that nothing is destructible  things merely change forms  When the consciousness we know as life ceases  I know that I shall still be part and parcel of the world  I was a part before the sun rolled into shape and burst forth in the glory of change  I was  when the earth was hurled out from its fiery rim  I shall return with the earth to Father Sun  and still exist in substance when the sun has lost its fire  and disintegrated into infinity to perhaps become a part of the whirling rubble of space  Why fear  The stuff of my being is matter  ever changing  ever moving  but never lost  so what need of denominations and creeds to deny myself the comfort of all my fellow men  The wide belt of the universe has no need for finger rings  I am one with the infinite and need no other assurance  In 1952  Hurston supported the presidential campaign of Senator Robert A  Taft  Like Taft  Hurston was against Franklin D  Roosevelt s New Deal policies  She also shared his opposition to Roosevelt and Truman s interventionist foreign policy  In the original draft of her autobiography  Dust Tracks on a Road  Hurston compared the United States government to a  fence  in stolen goods and to a Mafia like protection racket  Hurston thought it ironic that the same “people who claim that it is a noble thing to die for freedom and democracy     wax frothy if anyone points out the inconsistency of their morals     We  too  consider machine gun bullets good laxatives for heathens who get constipated with toxic ideas about a country of their own ” She was scathing about those who sought  freedoms  for those abroad but denied it to people in their home countries  Roosevelt  can call names across an ocean  for his Four Freedoms  but he did not have “the courage to speak even softly at home ” When Truman dropped the atomic bombs on Japan she called him “the Butcher of Asia ”  Hurston opposed the Supreme Court ruling in the Brown v  Board of Education case of 1954  She felt that if separate schools were truly equal  and she believed that they were rapidly becoming so   educating black students in physical proximity to white students would not result in better education  In addition  she worried about the demise of black schools and black teachers as a way to pass on cultural tradition to future generations of African Americans  She voiced this opposition in a letter   Court Order Can t Make the Races Mix   that was published in the Orlando Sentinel in August 1955  Hurston had not reversed her long time opposition to segregation  Rather  she feared that the Court s ruling could become a precedent for an all powerful federal government to undermine individual liberty on a broad range of issues in the future  Hurston also opposed preferential treatment for African Americans  saying   If I say a whole system must be upset for me to win  I am saying that I cannot sit in the game  and that safer rules must be made to give me a chance  I repudiate that  If others are in there  deal me a hand and let me see what I can make of it  even though I know some in there are dealing from the bottom and cheating like hell in other ways   5  Criticism and plagiarism  Darwin Turner  one of Hurston s biographers  faulted her for racism for opposing integration  and for opposing programs to guarantee blacks the right to work   Other authors criticized Hurston for her sensationalist representation of voodoo  In The Crisis  Harold Preece criticized Hurston for her perpetuation of  Negro primitivism  in order to advance her own literary career  The Journal of Negro History complained that her work on voodoo was an indictment of African American ignorance and supersition   Jeffrey Anderson states that Hurston s research methods were questionable  and that she fabricated material for her works on voodoo  He observed that she admitted inventing dialogue for her book Mules and Men in a letter to Ruth Benedict  She described fabricating the Mules and Men story of rival voodoo doctors as a child in her later autobiography  Anderson observes that many of Hurston s other claims in her voodoo writings are dubious as well   Several authors have observed that Hurston engaged in significant plagiarism in at least three works  Her article  Cudjo s own story of the last African slaver  was only 25% original  the rest being plagiarized  Hurston also plagiarized much of her work on voodoo   6  Selected bibliography   Journey s End   Negro World  1922   poetry   Night   Negro
