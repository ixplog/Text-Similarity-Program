Platonic idealism usually refers to Plato s theory of forms or doctrine of ideas  Some commentators hold Plato argued that truth is an abstraction  In other words  we are urged to believe that Plato s theory of ideas is an abstraction  divorced from the so called external world  of modern European philosophy  despite the fact Plato taught that ideas are ultimately real  and different from non ideal things—indeed  he argued for a distinction between the ideal and non ideal realm   These commentators speak thus  For example  a particular tree  with a branch or two missing  possibly alive  possibly dead  and with the initials of two lovers carved into its bark  is distinct from the abstract form of Tree ness  A Tree is the ideal that each of us holds that allows us to identify the imperfect reflections of trees all around us   Plato gives the divided line as an outline of this theory  At the top of the line  the Form of the Good is found  directing everything underneath   Some contemporary linguistic philosophers construe  Platonism  to mean the proposition that universals exist independently of particulars  a universal is anything that can be predicated of a particular    Platonism is an ancient school of philosophy  founded by Plato  at the beginning  this school had a physical existence at a site just outside the walls of Athens called the Academy  as well as the intellectual unity of a shared approach to philosophizing   Platonism is usually divided into three periods   Early Platonism  Middle Platonism  Neoplatonism Plato s students used the hypomnemata as the foundation to his philosophic approach to knowledge  The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read  heard  or thought  thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later meditation  For the Neoplatonist they also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect  such as anger  envy  gossip  flattery  or to overcome some difficult circumstance  such as a mourning  an exile  downfall  disgrace    Platonism is considered to be  in mathematics departments the world over  the predominant philosophy of mathematics  especially regarding the foundations of mathematics   One statement of this philosophy is the thesis that mathematics is not created but discovered  A lucid statement of this is found in an essay written by the British mathematician G  H  Hardy in defense of pure mathematics   The absence in this thesis of clear distinction between mathematical and nonmathematical  creation  leaves open the inference that it applies to allegedly creative endeavors in art  music  and literature   It is unknown if Plato s ideas of idealism have some earlier origin  but Plato held Pythagoras in high regard  and Pythagoras as well as his followers in the movement known as Pythagoreanism claimed the world was literally built up from numbers  an abstract  absolute form   1  See also  Cambridge Platonists  Gnosticism  Idealism  Plato  Platonic epistemology  Platonic realism  Platonic solids  Philosophy of mathematics  2  Notes  3  References   Plato And The Theory Of Forms   Tim Ruggiero  Philosophical Society  July 2002  webpage     Plato s Theory of Ideas  by W  D  Ross   Platonism and the Spiritual Life  by George Santayana   IDEA AND FORM  ΙΔΕΑ ΚΑΙ ΕΙΔΟΣ  On the Foundations of the Philosophy of Plato and the Presocratics  IDEA I FORMA  ΙΔΕΑ ΚΑΙ ΕΙΔΟΣ  O fundamentach filozofii Platona i presokratyków   by Artur Rodziewicz  2012
