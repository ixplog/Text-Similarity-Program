Max and Moritz  A Story of Seven Boyish Pranks   original  Max und Moritz   Eine Bubengeschichte in sieben Streichen  is a German language illustrated story in verse  This highly inventive  blackly humorous tale  told entirely in rhymed couplets  was written and illustrated by Wilhelm Busch and published in 1865  It is among the early works of Busch  nevertheless it already features many substantial  effectually aesthetic and formal regularities  procedures and basic patterns of Busch s later works  Many familiar with comic strip history consider it to have been the direct inspiration for the Katzenjammer Kids and Quick & Flupke  The German title satirizes the German custom of giving a subtitle to the name of dramas in the form of  Ein Drama in     Akten   A Drama of     acts   which became dictums in colloquial usage for any event with an unpleasant or dramatic course  e g   Bundespräsidentenwahl   Drama in drei Akten   Federal presidential Elections   Drama in Three Acts    1  Cultural significance  Busch s classic tale of the terrible duo  now in the public domain  has since become a proud part of the culture in German speaking countries  Even today  parents usually read these tales to their not yet literate children  To this day in Germany  Austria  and Switzerland  a certain familiarity with the story and its rhymes is still presumed  as it is often referenced in mass communication  The two leering faces are synonymous with mischief  and appear almost logo like in advertising and even graffiti   During World War 1  the Red Baron  Manfred von Richthofen  named his dog Moritz  giving the name Max to another animal given to his friend   It even occurs that young German couples name their boy twins Max and Moritz respectively  depending on their individual sense of humour and the intended parenting   Max and Moritz is the first published original foreign children’s book in Japan which was translated into rōmaji by Shinjirō Shibutani and Kaname Oyaizu in 1887 as   Naughty stories     Max and Moritz became the forerunners to the comic strip  The story inspired Rudolph Dirks to create The Katzenjammer Kids   The influence of these characters in German culture is also evident in their names being appplied to two British armoured command vehicles that were captured by the German army during World War 2 in North Africa  Their new German owners named the vehicles Max and Moritz  as can be seen in numerous photographs of the vehicles online and in books   Max and Moritz also made an appearance on the Eastern Front during World War 2  as the nicknames of a pair of prototype self propelled guns based on the Henschel 30 01 chassis  one of the two was destroyed  the other captured at Stalingrad  It is currently on display at the Kubinka Tank Museum   2  The pranks  There have been several English translations of the original German verses over the years  but all have maintained the original trochaic tetrameter   2 1  Preface  Ah  how oft we read or hear of Boys we almost stand in fear of  For example  take these stories Of two youths  named Max and Moritz  Who  instead of early turning Their young minds to useful learning  Often leered with horrid features At their lessons and their teachers   Look now at the empty head  he Is for mischief always ready  Teasing creatures   climbing fences  Stealing apples  pears  and quinces  Is  of course  a deal more pleasant  And far easier for the present  Than to sit in schools or churches  Fixed like roosters on their perches  But O dear  O dear  O deary  When the end comes sad and dreary   Tis a dreadful thing to tell That on Max and Moritz fell  All they did this book rehearses  Both in pictures and in verses   2 2  First Trick  The Widow  The boys tie several crusts of bread together with thread  and lay this trap in the chicken yard of Witwe Bolte  an old widow  causing all the chickens to become fatally entangled   This prank is remarkably similar to the eighth history of the classic German prankster tales of Till Eulenspiegel   2 3  Second Trick  The Widow II  As the widow cooks her chickens  the boys sneak onto her roof  When she leaves her kitchen momentarily  the boys steal the chickens using a fishing pole down the chimney  The widow hears her dog barking and hurries upstairs  finds the hearth empty and beats the dog   2 4  Third Trick  The Tailor  The boys torment Schneider Böck  a well liked tailor who has a fast stream flowing in front of his house  They saw through the planks of his wooden bridge  making a precarious gap  then taunt him by making goat noises  until he runs outside  The bridge breaks  the tailor is swept away and nearly drowns  but for two geese  which he grabs a hold of and which fly high to safety    Although Till removes the planks of the bridge instead of sawing them there are some similarities to Till Eulenspiegel  32nd History    2 5  Fourth Trick  The Teacher  While their devout teacher  Lehrer Lämpel  is busy at church  the boys invade his home and fill his favorite pipe with gunpowder  When he lights the pipe  the blast knocks him unconscious  blackens his skin and burns away all his hair  But   Time that comes will quick repair  yet the pipe retains its share    2 6  Fifth Trick  The Uncle  The boys collect bags full of May bugs  which they promptly deposit in their Uncle Fritz s bed  Uncle is nearly asleep when he feels the bugs walking on his nose  Horrified  he goes into a frenzy  killing them with a shoe   2 7  Sixth Trick  The Baker  The boys invade a bakery which they believe is closed  Attempting to steal pretzels  they fall into a vat of dough  The baker returns  catches the breaded pair  and bakes them  But they survive  and escape by gnawing through their crusts   2 8  Final Trick  The Farmer  Hiding out in the grain storage area of a farmer  Bauer Mecke  the boys slit some grain sacks  Carrying away one of the sacks  Bauer Mecke immediately notices the problem  He puts the boys in the sack instead  then takes it to the mill  The boys are ground to bits and devoured by the miller’s ducks  Later  no one expresses regret   The mill really exists in Ebergötzen  Germany  and can be visited   3  References  4  External links  in German for a single work  App for iPad iPhone iPod  told with animated pictures and readout function
