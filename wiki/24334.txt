Pope Stephen IV    c  770 – 24 January 817  was Pope from June 816 to his death in 817   1  Biography  The son of a Roman noble called Marinus  Stephen IV belonged to the same family which also produced the Popes Sergius II and Adrian II  At a young age he was raised at the Lateran Palace during the pontificate of Pope Adrian I  and it was under Stephen s predecessor Pope Leo III that he was first ordained a Subdeacon before he was subsequently made a Deacon  Very popular among the Roman people  within ten days of Leo III’s death  he was escorted to Saint Peter’s Basilica and consecrated Bishop of Rome on 22 June 816  It has been conjectured that his rapid election was an attempt by the Roman clergy to ensure that the Roman emperor could not interfere in the election   Immediately after his consecration he ordered the Roman people to swear fidelity to the Frankish king and Roman emperor Louis the Pious  after which Stephen sent envoys to the emperor notifying him of his election  and to arrange a meeting between the two at the emperor’s convenience  With Louis’ invitation  Stephen left Rome in August 816  crossing the Alps together with Bernard  the King of the Lombards  who was ordered to accompany Stephen to the emperor  In early October  the Pope and Emperor met at Rheims  where Louis prostrated himself three times before Stephen  At Mass on Sunday  5 October 816  Stephen consecrated and anointed Louis as emperor  placing a crown on his head that was claimed to belong to Constantine the Great  At the same time he also crowned Louis’ wife Ermengarde of Hesbaye  and saluted her as Augusta  This event has been seen as an attempt by the Papacy to establish a role in the creation of an emperor  which had been placed in doubt by Louis  self coronation in 813   While with Louis  the emperor gave Stephen a number of presents  including an estate of land  most likely at Vendeuvre sur Barse  granted to the Roman church  They also renewed the pact between the Popes and the kings of the Franks  confirming the privileges of the Roman church  and the continued existence of the recently emerged Papal States  Stephen also raised Bishop Theodulf of Orléans to the rank of Archbishop  and had Louis release from their exile all political prisoners originally from Rome who had been held by the emperor resulting from the conflict that plagued the early part of Pope Leo III’s reign  It is also believed that Stephen asked Louis to enforce reforms for the clergy who lived under the Rule of Chrodegang  This included ensuring that the men and women who lived there were to stay in separate convents  and that they were to hold the houses under a title of common property  He also regulated how much food and wine they could consume   After visiting Ravenna on his way back from Rheims  Stephen returned to Rome before the end of November 816  Here  he apparently discontinued Leo III’s policies of favouring clergy over lay aristocracy  After holding the traditional ordination of priests and bishops in December and confirming Farfa Abbey’s possessions on condition that every day the monks would recite one hundred “Kyrie Eleisons” as well as a yearly payment to the Roman Church of ten golden solidi  Stephen died on 24 January 817  He was buried at St  Peter’s  and was succeeded by Pope Paschal I  At some point  Stephen was canonized as a saint of the Catholic Church   2  Notes  3  References  Duffy  Eamon  Saints and Sinners  A History of the Popes  Yale University Press  1997   Mann  Horace K   The Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages  Vol  II  The Popes During the Carolingian Empire  795–858  1906   4  External links
