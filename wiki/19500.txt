Mervyn Laurence Peake  9 July 1911 – 17 November 1968  was an English writer  artist  poet and illustrator  He is best known for what are usually referred to as the Gormenghast books  The three works were part of what Peake conceived as a lengthy cycle  the completion of which was prevented by his death  They are sometimes compared to the work of his older contemporary J  R  R  Tolkien  but his surreal fiction was influenced by his early love for Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson rather than Tolkien s studies of mythology and philology   Peake also wrote poetry and literary nonsense in verse form  short stories for adults and children  Letters from a Lost Uncle   stage and radio plays  and Mr Pye  a relatively tightly structured novel in which God implicitly mocks the evangelical pretensions and cosy world view of the eponymous hero   Peake first made his reputation as a painter and illustrator during the 1930s and 1940s  when he lived in London  and he was commissioned to produce portraits of well known people  For a short time at the end of World War II he was commissioned by various newspapers to depict war scenes  A collection of his drawings is still in the possession of his family  Although he gained little popular success in his lifetime  his work was highly respected by his peers  and his friends included Dylan Thomas and Graham Greene  His works are now included in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery  the Imperial War Museum and The National Archives   In 2008  The Times named Peake among their list of  The 50 greatest British writers since 1945    1  Early life  Mervyn Peake was born of British parents in Kuling  Lushan  in Jiangxi Province of central China in 1911  only three months before the revolution and the founding of the Republic of China  His father Ernest Cromwell Peake was a medical missionary doctor with the London Missionary Society of the Congregationalist tradition and his mother  Amanda Elizabeth Powell  had come to China as a missionary assistant   The Peakes were given leave to visit England just before World War I in 1914 and returned to China in 1916  Mervyn Peake attended Tientsin Grammar School until the family left for England in December 1922 via the Trans Siberian Railway  About this time he wrote a novella  The White Chief of the Umzimbooboo Kaffirs  Peake never returned to China but it has been noted that Chinese influences can be detected in his works  not least in the castle of Gormenghast itself  which in some respects echoes the ancient walled city of Beijing  as well as the enclosed compound where he grew up in Tianjin  It is also likely that his early exposure to the contrasts between the lives of the Europeans and of the Chinese  and between the poor and the wealthy in China  also exerted an influence on the Gormenghast books   His education continued at Eltham College  Mottingham  1923–29   where his talents were encouraged by his English teacher  Eric Drake  Peake completed his formal education at Croydon School of Art in the autumn of 1929 and then from December 1929 to 1933 at the Royal Academy Schools  where he first painted in oils  By this time he had written his first long poem   A Touch o  the Ash   In 1931 he had a painting accepted for display by the Royal Academy and exhibited his work with the so called  Soho Group    2  Career  His early career in the 1930s was as a painter in London  although he lived on the Channel Island of Sark for a time  He first moved to Sark in 1932 where his former teacher Eric Drake was setting up an artists  colony  In 1934 he exhibited with the Sark artists both in the Sark Gallery built by Drake and at the Cooling Galleries in London  In 1935 he exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the Leger Galleries in London   In 1936 he returned to London and was commissioned to design the sets and costumes for Insect Play and his work was acclaimed in The Sunday Times  He also began teaching life drawing at Westminster School of Art where he met the painter Maeve Gilmore  whom he married in 1937  They had three children  Sebastian  1940–2012   Fabian  b  1942   and Clare  b  1949    He had a very successful exhibition of paintings at the Calmann Gallery in London in 1938 and his first book  the self illustrated children s pirate romance Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor  based on a story he had written around 1936  was first published in 1939 by Country Life  In December 1939 he was commissioned by Chatto & Windus to illustrate a children s book  Ride a Cock Horse and Other Nursery Rhymes  published for the Christmas market in 1940   2 1  Enlistment  At the outbreak of World War II he applied to become a war artist for he was keen to put his skills at the service of his country  He imagined An Exhibition by the Artist  Adolf Hitler  in which horrific images of war with ironic titles were offered as  artworks  by the Nazi leader  Although the drawings were bought by the British Ministry of Information  his application was turned down and he was conscripted in the Army  where he served first with the Royal Artillery  then with the Royal Engineers  He began writing Titus Groan at this time   In April 1942  after his requests for commissions as a war artist – or even leave to depict war damage in London – had been consistently refused  he suffered a nervous breakdown and was sent to Southport Hospital  That autumn he was taken on as a graphic artist by the Ministry of Information for a period of six months  The next spring he was invalided out of the Army  In 1943 he was commissioned by the War Artists  Advisory Committee  WAAC  to paint glassblowers at a Birmingham factory  Peake was next given a full time  three month WAAC contract to depict various factory subjects  including the production of cathode ray tubes for early radar sets  and was also asked to submitt a large painting showing RAF pilots being debriefed  Some of these paintings are on permanent display in Manchester Art Gallery whilst other examples are in the Imperial War Museum collection   2 2  Illustration and writing  The five years between 1943 and 1948 were some of the most productive of his career  He finished Titus Groan and Gormenghast and completed some of his most acclaimed illustrations for books by other authors  including Lewis Carroll s Hunting of the Snark  for which he was reportedly paid only £5  and Alice in Wonderland  Samuel Taylor Coleridge s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner  the Brothers Grimm s Household Tales  All This and Bevin Too by Quentin Crisp and Robert Louis Stevenson s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  as well as producing many original poems  drawings  and paintings   Peake designed the logo for Pan Books  The publishers offered him either a flat fee of £10 or a royalty of one farthing per book  On the advice of Graham Greene  who told him that paperback books were a passing fad that wouldn t last  Peake opted for the £10   A book of nonsense poems  Rhymes Without Reason  was published in 1944 and was described by John Betjeman as  outstanding   Shortly after the war ended in 1945 he was commissioned by a magazine to visit France and Germany  With writer Tom Pocock he was among the first British civilians to witness the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp at Belsen  where the remaining prisoners  too sick to be moved  were dying before his very eyes  He made several drawings  but not surprisingly he found the experience profoundly harrowing  and expressed in deeply felt poems the ambiguity of turning their suffering into art   In 1946 the family moved to Sark  where Peake continued to write and illustrate  and Maeve painted  Gormenghast was published in 1950  and the family moved back to England  settling in Smarden  Kent  Peake taught part time at the Central School of Art  began his comic novel Mr Pye  and renewed his interest in theatre  His father died that year and left his house in Hillside Gardens in Wallington  Surrey to Mervyn  Mr Pye was published in 1953  and he later adapted it as a radio play  The BBC broadcast other plays of his in 1954 and 1956   3  Later life  In 1956 Mervyn and Maeve visited Spain  financed by a friend who hoped that Peake s health  which was already declining  would be improved by the holiday  That year his novella Boy in Darkness was published beside stories by William Golding and John Wyndham in a volume called Sometime  Never  On 18 December the BBC broadcast his radio play The Eye of the Beholder  later revised as The Voice of One  in which an avant garde artist is commissioned to paint a church mural  Peake placed much hope in his play The Wit To Woo which was finally staged in London s West End in 1957  but it was a critical and commercial failure  This affected him greatly – his health degenerated rapidly and he was again admitted to hospital with a nervous breakdown   3 1  Declining health  He was showing unmistakable early symptoms of dementia  for which he was given electroconvulsive therapy  to little avail  Over the next few years he gradually lost the ability to draw steadily and quickly  although he still managed to produce some drawings with the help of his wife  Among his last completed works were the illustrations for Balzac s Droll Stories  1961  and for his own poem The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb  1962   which he had written some 15 years earlier   Titus Alone was published in 1959 and was revised by Langdon Jones in 1970 to remove apparent inconsistencies introduced by the publisher s careless editing  A 1995 edition of all three completed Gormenghast novels includes a very short fragment of the beginning of what would have been the fourth Gormenghast novel  Titus Awakes  as well as a listing of events and themes he wanted to address in that and later Gormenghast novels   4  Death  In the late 1950s  while writing Titus Alone  Peake s health subsequently declined into physical and mental incapacitation  and he died on 17 November 1968 at a care home run by his brother in law  at Burcot  near Oxford  He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary s in the village of Burpham  Sussex   A 2003 study published in JAMA Neurology diagnosed Peake as dying from dementia with Lewy bodies  DLB    His work  especially the Gormenghast series  became much better known and more widely appreciated after his death  They have since been translated into more than two dozen languages   5  Publications  Six volumes of Peake s verse were published during his lifetime  Shapes & Sounds  1941   Rhymes without Reason 1944  The Glassblowers  1950   The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb  1962   Poems & Drawings  1965   and A Reverie of Bone  1967   After his death came Selected Poems  1972   followed by Peake s Progress in  1979 – though the Penguin edition of 1982  with many corrections  including a whole stanza inadvertently omitted from the hardback edition  is to be preferred   The Collected Poems of Mervyn Peake was published by Carcanet Press in June 2008  Other collections include The Drawings of Mervyn Peake  1974   Writings and Drawings  1974   and Mervyn Peake  the man and his art  2006   A collected edition of the works  issued to celebrate Peake s centenary year  has been announced for publication by Queen Anne Press  2012    6  Archive  In 2010 an archive consisting of 28 containers of material  which included correspondence between Peake and Laurie Lee  Walter de la Mare and CS Lewis  plus 39 Gormenghast notebooks and original drawings for both Alice Through the Looking Glass and Alice s Adventures in Wonderland  was acquired by the British Library   7  Dramatic adaptations of Peake s work  In 1983  the Australian Broadcasting

Stephen Fry and Eric Sykes and the series is also notable as the last screen performance by comedy legend Spike Milligan  as the Headmaster    A minimalist stage version of Gormenghast performed by the David Glass Ensemble was adapted by John Constable and directed by David Glass  The production features atmospheric music and lighting and relies heavily on mime  all to convey the immense vastness of the Gormenghast castle on the small stage  It toured theatres in the UK during 2006 and 2007   A 30 minute TV short film A Boy in Darkness  also made in 2000 and adapted from Peake s novella  was the first production from the BBC Drama Lab  It was set in a  virtual  computer generated world created by young computer game designers  and starred Jack Ryder  from EastEnders  as Titus

maintain his world of fantasy brilliantly through three novels   The Gormenghast trilogy  is a very  very great work     a classic of our age   — Robertson Davies    Peake s books  are actual additions to life  they give  like certain rare dreams  sensations we never had before  and enlarge our conception of the range of possible experience   — C  S  Lewis   Fuchsia was my dream  This idea of the infinite  of the unreal  of the innocence dying     — Robert Smith 2003  about the Peake character that inspired the early Cure song The Drowning Man in 1980   10  References  10 1  General
