Princetown is a village situated in the Dartmoor national park in the English county of Devon  It is the principal settlement of the civil parish of Dartmoor Forest   The village has its origins in 1785  when Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt  Secretary to the Prince of Wales  leased a large area of moorland from the Duchy of Cornwall estate  hoping to convert it into good farmland  He encouraged people to live in the area and suggested that a prison be built there  He called the settlement Princetown after the Prince of Wales   Princetown is the site of Dartmoor Prison  At around 435 metres  1 430 feet  above sea level  it is the highest settlement on the moor  and one of the highest in the United Kingdom  It is also the largest settlement located on the high moor  The Princetown Railway  closed in 1956  was also the highest railway line in England  its Princetown terminus being above sea level   1  History  In 1780  a farm was reclaimed on the site of an ancient tenement near the Two Bridges  and in 1785  Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt set about improving the moor at a place which he named Tor Royal  present day Tor Royal farm   about south east of Princetown  He made an estate and built a house in 1798  Later the road from Tavistock to Princetown was built  as well as the other roads that now cross the Moor   He also proposed that a prison be built on Dartmoor to house the thousands of captives of the Napoleonic Wars and the later War of 1812  who had become too numerous to lodge in the prisons and prison ships at Plymouth  The site was given by the Prince of Wales  who held the lands of the Duchy of Cornwall to which all the Moor belonged  This is why the settlement is named Princetown  Dartmoor Prison was built in 1806 at a cost of £130 000 and at one time had a capacity between 7 000 and 9 000 prisoners   A small town grew up near the prison  Two large inns were built during the war  Many of the prisoners had prize money to come from their own country  many others made their own in their hammocks at night  even forging Bank of England and local bank notes  which they passed off in the great daily market held in the prison  With the closing of the prison in 1816  the town almost collapsed  but the completion of the Dartmoor Railway in 1823 brought back many people to the granite quarries  The prison remained derelict until 1851  when it was reopened for prisoners serving long sentences  It has since been considerably extended   2  Geography  The village is located on the B3212 road between Yelverton and Two Bridges  and is surrounded by moorland  Several footpaths across the moor pass through the village  including one leading west to Sampford Spiney and one leading south to Nun s Cross and Erme Head   Tor Royal Lane is a dead end road which leads down from the village to the site of the disused Whiteworks tin mine  about 3 km or 2 miles to the south east  which overlooks Fox Tor Mires  the presumed site of the Grimpen Mire to be found in Arthur Conan Doyle s tale The Hound of the Baskervilles  Conan Doyle stayed at the former Duchy Hotel whilst writing and researching the story with his friend  Bertram Fletcher Robinson  The hotel has long since closed and the building now houses the National Park Visitor Centre which is an all weather Centre and activity hub  With interactive displays  films  inspiring exhibitions and a fun children’s discovery area  Visit this free centre to find out more about the Dartmoor Story  and Dartmoor’s Sherlock Holmes connection   Other points of interest in the village include the prison museum and the churchyard which includes the graves of French and American prisoners of war who were housed at the prison  The Church of St Michael has the distinction of being the only one in England constructed by POWs and is dedicated  as are many churches in high locations  to St  Michael  It was taken out of use due to structural problems and damp and is now maintained by the Churches Conservation Trust  although the building has been stabilised and made safe  Services are held nowadays in the Methodist chapel at the other end of the village   The village is overlooked from the north west by North Hessary Tor upon which is a tall transmitting mast that provides a useful guide point for walkers from miles around   3  Demography  The village is mainly made up of white British people living in a mix of social and private housing  There are currently 74 children enrolled at the Primary school and a further 17 at the pre school  which is contained within the Community Centre in its own purpose built wing  Most people living in Princetown commute to Plymouth and Tavistock for work but with the expansion of the brewery more jobs have been created locally  The brewery is set to double in size in 2014  creating further local jobs  The population is projected to keep increasing in the future mainly due to the improved amenities within the village itself and the relatively high percentage of young people living there  Princetown is undergoing significant regeneration and expansion  with new private housing being built at several sites in the village and a football pitch being built behind the Community Centre  The High Moorland Visitor Centre has been renamed as the  National Park Visitor Centre  with the area outside the centre being altered to include artwork and new seating areas  local consultation is currently ongoing to decide the nature of the artwork and layout of the new seating area   4  Economy  In terms of tourism  Princetown is popular with walkers and the sight of large groups of young people with rucksacks is especially common during the summer months  A bunkhouse  bed and breakfast and camping facilities are available in the village and there are also a handful of local shops   Princetown has a brewery producing the appropriately named Jail Ale  Legend and Dartmoor IPA  This used to be housed in the Prince of Wales pub  but now occupies a modern purpose built building on the edge of the village  close to the former railway  The other pub is the Plume of Feathers  the Railway inn –  The Devils Elbow  – has closed as a pub recently  and there are also a couple of cafes  one of which is in what used to be the police station   In recent years Princetown has seen the opening of both the Princetown Centre for Creativity in Duchy Square  which closed in 2011   on the site of the former village supermarket  and a new village Community Centre  which also houses a GP s office  library and pre school   5  Transport  A summer bus service  the Transmoor link from Plymouth to Exeter and vice versa  passes through the village and there is a daytime service linking Princetown to Yelverton and Tavistock  The Transmoor link operates in the winter  but only on Sundays   6  Notes  7  References  8  External links
