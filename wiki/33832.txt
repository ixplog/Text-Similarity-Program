Sir William Wallace  Medieval Gaelic  Uilliam Uallas  modern Scottish Gaelic  Uilleam Uallas  Norman French  William le Waleys  c  1270 – 23 August 1305  was a Scottish landowner who became one of the main leaders during the Wars of Scottish Independence   Along with Andrew Moray  Wallace defeated an English army at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in September 1297  He was appointed Guardian of Scotland and served until his defeat at the Battle of Falkirk in July 1298  In August 1305  Wallace was captured in Robroyston  near Glasgow  and handed over to King Edward I of England  who had him hanged  drawn  and quartered for high treason and crimes against English civilians   Since his death  Wallace has obtained an iconic status far beyond his homeland  He is the protagonist of Blind Harry s 15th century epic poem The Wallace and the subject of literary works by Sir Walter Scott and Jane Porter  and of the Academy Award winning film Braveheart  1995    1  Background  William Wallace was a member of the lesser nobility  but little is definitely known of his family history or even his parentage  Blind Harry s late 15th century poem gives his father as Sir Malcolm of Elderslie  however William s own seal  found on a letter sent to the Hanse city of Lübeck in 1297  gives his father s name as Alan Wallace  This Alan Wallace may be the same as the one listed in the 1296 Ragman Rolls as a crown tenant in Ayrshire  but there is no additional confirmation  Blind Harry s assertion that William was the son of Sir Malcolm of Elderslie has given rise to a tradition that William s birthplace was at Elderslie in Renfrewshire  and this is still the view of some historians  but William s seal has given rise to a counter claim of Ellerslie in Ayrshire  There is no contemporary evidence linking him with either location  although both areas had connections with the wider Wallace family  Records show early members of the family as holding estates at Riccarton  Tarbolton  and Auchincruive in Kyle  and Stenton in Haddingtonshire  They were vassals of James Stewart  5th High Steward of Scotland as their lands fell within his territory  Wallace s brothers Malcolm and John are known from other sources   The origins of the Wallace surname and its association with southwest Scotland are also far from certain  other than the name s being derived from the Old English wylisc  pronounced  wullish    meaning  foreigner  or  Welshman   It is possible that all the Wallaces in the Clyde area were medieval immigrants from Wales  but as the term was also used for local Cumbric speaking Strathclyde Welsh  it seems equally likely that the surname refers to people who were seen as being  Welsh  due to their Cumbric language   2  Political crisis in Scotland  When Wallace was growing up  King Alexander III ruled Scotland  His reign had seen a period of peace and economic stability  On 19 March 1286  however  Alexander died after falling from his horse   The heir to the throne was Alexander s granddaughter  Margaret  Maid of Norway  As she was still a child and in Norway  the Scottish lords set up a government of guardians  Margaret fell ill on the voyage to Scotland and died in Orkney on 26 September 1290  The lack of a clear heir led to a period known as the  Great Cause   with several families laying claim to the throne   With Scotland threatening to descend into civil war  King Edward I of England was invited in by the Scottish nobility to arbitrate  Before the process could begin  he insisted that all of the contenders recognise him as Lord Paramount of Scotland  In early November 1292  at a great feudal court held in the castle at Berwick upon Tweed  judgement was given in favour of John Balliol having the strongest claim in law   Edward proceeded to reverse the rulings of the Scottish Lords and even summoned King John Balliol to stand before the English court as a common plaintiff  John was a weak king  known as  Toom Tabard  or  Empty Coat   John renounced his homage in March 1296 and by the end of the month Edward stormed Berwick upon Tweed  sacking the then Scottish border town  In April  the Scots were defeated at the Battle of Dunbar in East Lothian and by July  Edward had forced John to abdicate  Edward then instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some 1 800 Scottish nobles  many of the rest being prisoners of war at that time    3  Silent years prior to the Wars of Independence  Some historians  such as Andrew Fisher  believe Wallace must have had some earlier military experience in order to lead a successful military campaign in 1297  Campaigns like Edward I of England s wars in Wales might have provided a good opportunity for a younger son of a landholder to become a mercenary soldier  Wallace s personal seal bears the archer s insignia  so he may have fought as an archer in Edward s army   Walter Bower states that Wallace was  a tall man with the body of a giant     with lengthy flanks     broad in the hips  with strong arms and legs     with all his limbs very strong and firm   Blind Harry s Wallace reaches seven feet   4  Start of the uprising  The first act definitely known to have been carried out by Wallace was his assassination of William de Heselrig  the English High Sheriff of Lanark  in May 1297  He then joined with William the Hardy  Lord of Douglas  and they carried out the raid of Scone  This was one of several rebellions taking place across Scotland  including those of several Scottish nobles and Andrew Moray in the north   The uprising suffered a blow when the nobles submitted to the English at Irvine in July  Wallace and Moray were not involved  and continued their rebellions  Wallace used the Ettrick Forest as a base for raiding  and attacked Wishart s palace at Ancrum  Wallace and Moray met and joined their forces  possibly at the siege of Dundee in early September   5  Battle of Stirling Bridge  On 11 September 1297  an army jointly led by Wallace and Andrew Moray won the Battle of Stirling Bridge  Although vastly outnumbered  the Scottish army routed the English army  John de Warenne  6th Earl of Surrey s professional army of 3 000 cavalry and 8 000 to 10 000 infantry met disaster as they crossed over to the north side of the river  The narrowness of the bridge prevented many soldiers from crossing together  possibly as few as three men abreast   so  while the English soldiers crossed  the Scots held back until half of them had passed and then killed the English as quickly as they could cross  The infantry were sent on first  followed by heavy cavalry  The Scots  schiltron formations forced the infantry back into the advancing cavalry  A pivotal charge  led by one of Wallace s captains  caused some of the English soldiers to retreat as others pushed forward  and under the overwhelming weight  the bridge collapsed and many English soldiers drowned  Thus  the Scots won a significant victory  boosting the confidence of their army  Hugh Cressingham  Edward s treasurer in Scotland  died in the fighting and it is reputed that his body was subsequently flayed and the skin cut into small pieces as tokens of the victory  The Lanercost Chronicle records that Wallace had  a broad strip  of Cressingham’s skin      taken from the head to the heel  to make therewith a baldrick for his sword    After the battle  Moray and Wallace assumed the title of Guardians of the Kingdom of Scotland on behalf of King John Balliol  Moray died of wounds suffered on the battlefield sometime in late 1297   The type of engagement conducted by Wallace was characterized by opportunistic tactics and the strategic use of terrain  This was in stark contrast to the contemporary views on chivalric warfare which were characterized by strength of arms and knightly combat  Therefore  the battle embittered relations between the two antagonistic nations  whilst also perhaps providing a new departure in the type of warfare which England had hitherto employed  The numerical and material inferiority of the Scottish forces would be mirrored by that of the English in the Hundred Years  War  who  in turn  abandoned chivalric warfare to achieve decisive victory in similar engagements such as Crécy and Poitiers   Around November 1297  Wallace led a large scale raid into northern England  through Northumberland and Cumberland   In a ceremony in Selkirk Abbey towards the end of the year  Wallace was knighted  This would have been carried out by one of three Scottish earls — Carrick  Strathearn or Lennox   6  Battle of Falkirk  In April 1298  Edward ordered a second invasion of Scotland  He had an army of 3000 men from 23 clans  They plundered Lothian and regained some castles  but failed to bring William Wallace to combat  the Scots shadowed the English army  intending to avoid battle until shortages of supplies and money forced Edward to withdraw  at which point the Scots would harass his retreat  The English quartermasters  failure to prepare for the expedition left morale and food supplies low  and a resulting riot within Edward s own army had to be put down by his cavalry  In July  while planning a return to Edinburgh for supplies  Edward received intelligence that the Scots were encamped nearby at Falkirk  and he moved quickly to engage them in the pitched battle he had long hoped for   Wallace arranged his spearmen in four schiltrons — circular  hedgehog formations surrounded by a defensive wall of wooden stakes  The English  however  employed Welsh longbowmen  who swung strategic superiority in their favour  The English proceeded to attack with cavalry  and break up the Scottish archers  Under the command of the Scottish nobles  the Scottish knights withdrew  and Edward s men began to attack the schiltrons  It remains unclear whether the infantry shooting bolts  arrows and stones at the spearmen proved the deciding factor  although it is very likely that it was the arrows of Edward s bowmen  Gaps in the schiltrons soon appeared  and the English exploited these to crush the remaining resistance  The Scots lost many men  including John de Graham  Wallace escaped  though his military reputation suffered badly   By September 1298  Wallace resigned as Guardian of Scotland in favour of Robert the Bruce  Earl of Carrick and future king  and John III Comyn  Lord of Badenoch  King John Balliol s nephew   Details of Wallace s activities after this are vague  but there is some evidence that he left on a mission to the court of King Philip IV of France to plead the case for assistance in the Scottish struggle for independence  There is a surviving letter from the French king dated 7 November 1300 to his envoys in Rome demanding that they should help Sir William  It also suggests that Wallace may have intended to travel to Rome  although it is not known if he did  There is also a report from an English spy at a meeting of Scottish leaders  where they said Wallace was in France   By 1304 Wallace was back in Scotland  and involved in skirmishes at Happrew and Earnside   7  Capture and execution  Wallace evaded capture by the English until 5 August 1305 when John de Menteith  a Scottish knight loyal to Edward  turned Wallace over to English soldiers at Robroyston near Glasgow  Letters of safe conduct from Haakon V of Norway  Philip IV of France  and John Balliol  along with other documents  were found on Wallace and delivered to Edward by John de Segrave   Wallace was transported to London  lodged in the house of William de Leyrer  then taken to Westminster Hall  where he was tried for treason and for atrocities against civilians in war   sparing neither age nor sex  monk nor nun   He was crowned with a garland of oak to suggest he was the king of outlaws  He responded to the treason charge   I could not be a traitor to Edward  for I was never his subject   With this  Wallace asserted that the absent John Balliol was officially his king   Following the trial  on 23 August 1305  Wallace was taken from the hall to the Tower of London  then stripped naked and dragged through the city at the heels of a horse to the Elms at Smithfield  He was hanged  drawn and quartered — strangled by hanging  but released while he was still alive  emasculated  eviscerated and his bowels burnt before him  beheaded  then cut into four parts  His preserved head  dipped in tar  was placed on a pike atop London Bridge  It was later joined by the heads of the brothers  John and Simon Fraser  His limbs were displayed  separately  in Newcastle upon Tyne  Berwick upon Tweed  Stirling  and Perth  A plaque stands in a wall of St  Bartholomew s Hospital near the site of Wallace s execution at Smithfield   In 1869 the Wallace Monument was erected  very close to the site of his victory at Stirling Bridge  The Wallace Sword  which supposedly belonged to Wallace  although some parts were made at least 160 years later  was held for many years in Dumbarton Castle and is now in the Wallace Monument   8  Historiography of Wallace  Although there are problems with writing a satisfactory biography of many medieval people  the problems with Wallace are greater than usual  Not much is known about him beyond his military campaign of 1297–1298  and the last few weeks of his life in 1305  Even in recent years  his birthplace and his father s name have been argued   To compound this  the legacy of subsequent  biographical  accounts  sometimes written as propaganda  other times simply as entertainment  has clouded much scholarship until relatively recent times  Some accounts have uncritically copied elements from the epic poem  The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace  Knight of Elderslie  written around 1470 by Blind Harry the minstrel  Harry wrote from oral tradition describing events 170 years earlier  and is not in any sense an authoritative descriptor of Wallace s exploits  Much of the poem is clearly at variance with known historical facts and records of the period and is either fabricated using traditional chivalric motifs or  borrowed  from the exploits of others and attributed to Wallace   9  Wallace in fiction  9 1  Film  A well known account of Wallace s life is presented in the film Braveheart  1995   directed by and starring Mel Gibson as Wallace  written by Randall Wallace  and filmed in both Scotland and Ireland  The film  however  was criticised for inaccuracies regarding Wallace s title  love interests  and attire   9 2  Literature  In the early 19th century  Walter Scott wrote of Wallace in Exploits and Death of William Wallace  the  Hero of Scotland    Jane Porter penned a romantic version of the Wallace legend in The Scottish Chiefs  1810    G  A  Henty wrote a novel about this time period titled In Freedom s Cause  1885   Henty  a producer of and writer for the Boy s Own Paper story paper  portrays the life of William Wallace  Robert the Bruce  The Black Douglas  and others  while dovetailing the events of his novel with historical fiction   Nigel Tranter wrote an historical novel titled The Wallace  1975   which is said to be more accurate than its literary predecessors  \  The novel The Temple and the Stone  1998   by Katherine Kurtz and Deborah Turner Harris  includes an account of Wallace s victory at Stirling  his defeat at Falkirk  and his trial and execution in London  along with a fictional connection between Wallace and Templar Knights   10  See also  Auchenbathie Tower – Wallace s Knowe  Clan Wallace  Owain Glyndŵr  11  Notes
