Characteristics  1 1  Physical properties  Terbium is a silvery white rare earth metal that is malleable  ductile and soft enough to be scratched with a knife  It is relatively stable in air as compared to other lanthanides  Terbium exists in two crystal allotropes with a transformation temperature of 1289 °C between them   The terbium III  cation is brilliantly fluorescent  in a bright lemon yellow color that is the result of a strong green emission line in combination with other lines in the orange and red  The yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite owes its creamy yellow fluorescence in part to terbium  Terbium easily oxidizes  and is therefore used in its elemental form specifically for research  Single Tb atoms have been isolated by implanting them into fullerene molecules   Terbium has a simple ferromagnetic ordering at temperatures below 219 K  Above 219 K  it turns into a helical antiferromagnetic state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular basal plane layer are parallel  and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers  This unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered paramagnetic state at 230 K   1 2  Chemical properties  The most common valence state of terbium is +3  as in   The +4 state is known in TbO2 and TbF4  Terbium burns readily to form a mixed terbium III IV  oxide   In solution  terbium forms only trivalent ions  Terbium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form terbium hydroxide   Terbium metal reacts with all the halogens  forming white trihalides   Terbium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the pale pink terbium III  ions  which exist as a  Tb OH2 9 3+ complexes   1 3  Compounds  Terbium combines with nitrogen  carbon  sulfur  phosphorus  boron  selenium  silicon and arsenic at elevated temperatures  forming various binary compounds such as TbH2  TbH3  TbB2  Tb2S3  TbSe  TbTe and TbN  In those compounds  Tb mostly exhibits the oxidation states +3 and sometimes +2  Terbium II  halogenides are obtained by annealing Tb III  halogenides in presence of metallic Tb in tantalum containers  Terbium also forms sesquichloride Tb2Cl3  which can be further reduced to TbCl by annealing at 800 °C  This terbium I  chloride forms platelets with layered graphite like structure   Other compounds include  Chlorides  TbCl3  Bromides  TbBr3  Iodides  TbI3  Fluorides  TbF3  TbF4 Terbium IV  fluoride is a strong fluorinating agent  emitting relatively pure atomic fluorine when heated rather than the mixture of fluoride vapors emitted from CoF3 or CeF4   1 4  Isotopes  Naturally occurring terbium is composed of its only stable isotope  terbium 159  the element is thus called mononuclidic and monoisotopic  Thirty six radioisotopes have been characterized  with the heaviest being terbium 171  with atomic mass of 170 95330 86  u  and lightest being terbium 135  exact mass unknown   The most stable synthetic radioisotopes of terbium are terbium 158  with a half life of 180 years  and terbium 157  with a half life of 71 years  All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are much less than a quarter of a year  and the majority of these have half lives that are less than half a minute  The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope  159Tb  is electron capture  which results in production of gadolinium isotopes  and the primary mode after is beta minus decay  resulting in dysprosium isotopes   The element also has 27 nuclear isomers  with masses of 141–154  156  and 158  not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer   The most stable of them are terbium 156m  with half life of 24 4 hours and terbium 156m2  with half life of 22 7 hours  this is longer than half lives of most ground states of radioactive terbium isotopes  except only those with mass numbers 155–161   2  History  Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander  discovered terbium in 1843  He detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide  Y2O3  Yttrium is named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden  Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of ion exchange techniques   Mosander first separated yttria into three fractions  all named for the ore  yttria  erbia  and terbia   Terbia  was originally the fraction that contained the pink color  due to the element now known as erbium   Erbia   containing what we now call terbium  originally was the fraction that was essentially colorless in solution  The insoluble oxide of this element was noted to be tinged brown   Later workers had difficulty in observing the minor colorless  erbia   but the soluble pink fraction was impossible to miss  Arguments went back and forth as to whether erbia even existed  In the confusion  the original names got reversed  and the exchange of names stuck  so that the pink fraction referred eventually to the solution containing erbium  which in solution  is pink   It is now thought that workers using double sodium or potassium sulfates to remove ceria from yttria inadvertently lost the terbium into the ceria containing precipitate  What is now known as terbium was only about 1% of the original yttria  but that was sufficient to impart a yellowish color to the yttrium oxide  Thus  terbium was a minor component in the original fraction containing it  where it was dominated by its immediate neighbors  gadolinium and dysprosium   Thereafter  whenever other rare earths were teased apart from this mixture  whichever fraction gave the brown oxide retained the terbium name  until at last  the brown oxide of terbium was obtained in pure form  The 19th century investigators did not have the benefit of the UV fluorescence technology to observe the brilliant yellow or green Tb III  fluorescence that would have made terbium easier to identify in solid mixtures or solutions   3  Occurrence  Terbium is never found in nature by itself  but is contained along with other rare earth elements in many minerals  including monazite   Ce La Th Nd Y PO4 with up to 0 03% terbium   xenotime  YPO4  and euxenite   Y Ca Er La Ce U Th  Nb Ta Ti 2O6 with 1% or more terbium   The crust abundance of terbium is estimated as 1 2 mg kg   Currently  the richest commercial sources of terbium are the ion adsorption clays of southern China  the concentrates with about two thirds yttrium oxide by weight have about 1% terbia  Small amounts of terbium occur in bastnäsite and monazite  when these are processed by solvent extraction to recover the valuable heavy lanthanides as samarium europium gadolinium concentrate  terbium is recovered therein  Due to the large volumes of bastnäsite processed relative to the ion adsorption clays  a significant proportion of the world s terbium supply comes from bastnäsite   4  Production  Crushed terbium containing minerals are treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water soluble sulfates of rare earths  The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda to pH 3–4  Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed  After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates  The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing  The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components  cerium  whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3  Terbium is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization   The most efficient separation routine for terbium salt from the rare earth salt solution is ion exchange  In this process  rare earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen  ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin  The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent  As with other rare earths  terbium metal is produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal  Calcium and tantalum impurities can be removed by vacuum remelting  distillation  amalgam formation or zone melting   5  Applications  Terbium is used as a dopant in calcium fluoride  calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate  materials that are used in solid state devices  and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures  together with ZrO2   Terbium is also used in alloys and in the production of electronic devices  As a component of Terfenol D  terbium is of use in actuators  in naval sonar systems  sensors  in the SoundBug device  its first commercial application   and other magnetomechanical devices  Terfenol D is an alloy that expands or contracts in the presence of a magnetic field  It has the highest magnetostriction of any alloy   Terbium oxide is used in green phosphors in fluorescent lamps and color TV tubes  Sodium terbium borate is used in solid state devices  The brilliant fluorescence allows terbium to be used as a probe in biochemistry  where it somewhat resembles calcium in its behavior  Terbium  green  phosphors  which fluoresce a brilliant lemon yellow  are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide the  trichromatic  lighting technology which is by far the largest consumer of the world s terbium supply  Trichromatic lighting provides much higher light output for a given amount of electrical energy than does incandescent lighting   6  Precautions  As with the other lanthanides  terbium compounds are of low to moderate toxicity  although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail  Terbium has no known biological role   7  References  8  External links
