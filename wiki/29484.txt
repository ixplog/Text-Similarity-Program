A Seabee is a member of the United States Naval Mobile Construction Battalion  CB   The word  Seabee  comes from initials  CB   The Seabees have a history of building bases  bulldozing and paving thousands of miles of roadway and airstrips  and accomplishing a myriad of other construction projects in a wide variety of military theaters dating back to World War II   1  History  1 1  World War II  In December 1941  with U S  involvement in war soon expected on both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans  Rear Admiral Ben Moreell  Chief of the Navy s Bureau of Yards and Docks  recommended establishing Naval Construction Battalions at a newly constructed base at Davisville  Rhode Island  part of North Kingstown   With the attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States  entry into the war  he was given the go ahead  The Davisville Advanced Base Depot became operational in June 1942  Camp Thomas  a personnel receiving station on the base  was established in October of that year  It eventually contained 500 Quonset huts for personnel  On August 11  1942  the Naval Construction Training Center  known as Camp Endicott  was commissioned at Davisville  The Camp trained over 100 000 Seabees during the Second World War   In California in May 1942  a base for supporting the Naval Construction Force was established at Port Hueneme in Ventura County  This base became responsible for shipping massive amounts of equipment and material to the efforts in the Pacific   The earliest Seabees were recruited from the civilian construction trades and were placed under the leadership of the Navy s Civil Engineer Corps  Because of the emphasis on experience and skill rather than physical standards  the average age of Seabees during WWII was 37   More than 325 000 men served with the Seabees in World War II  fighting and building on six continents and more than 300 islands  In the Pacific  where most of the construction work was needed  the Seabees landed soon after the Marines and built major airstrips  bridges  roads  gasoline storage tanks  and Quonset huts for warehouses  hospitals  and housing  They often operated under fire and frequently were forced to take part in the fighting to defend themselves and their construction projects  In the Pacific Theater they built 111 major airstrips and 441 piers  tanks for the storage of 100 m gallons of fuel  housing for 1 5 million men and hospitals for 70 000 patients   The Seabees were officially organized in the Naval Reserve on December 31  1947   With the general demobilization following the war  the Naval Construction Battalions  NCBs  were reduced to 3 300 men on active duty by 1950  Between 1949 and 1953  Naval Construction Battalions were organized into two types of units  Amphibious Construction Battalions  ACBs  and Mobile Construction Battalions  MCBs   which were later designated Naval Mobile Construction Battalions  NMCBs  in the early  to mid 1960s to eliminate confusion with Marine Corps Base  MCB  in Vietnam   1 2  Korean War  The Korean War saw a call up of more than 10 000 men  The expansion of the Seabees came from the Naval Reserve Seabee program where individuals volunteered for active duty  The Seabees landed at Inchon with the assault troops  They fought enormous tides as well as enemy fire and provided causeways within hours of the initial landings  Their action here and at other landings emphasized the role of the Seabees  and there was no Seabee demobilization when the truce was declared   During the Korean War  the Navy realized they needed a naval air station in this region  Cubi Point in the Philippines was selected  and civilian contractors were initially selected for the project  After seeing the forbidding Zambales Mountains and the maze of jungle  they claimed it could not be done   The Navy then turned to the Seabees  The first Seabees to arrive were MCB 3 on October 2  1951  followed by MCB 5 on November 5  1951  Over the next five years  MCB 2   7   9   11 and  13 were also deployed to Cubi Point   Seabees cut a mountain in half to make way for a nearly two mile long runway  Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth moving projects in the world  equivalent to the construction of the Panama Canal  The $100 million facility was commissioned on July 25  1956  and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy s largest carriers   Following Korea  the Seabees embarked on a new mission  From providing much needed assistance in the wake of a devastating earthquake in Greece in 1953 to providing construction work and training to underdeveloped countries  the Seabees became  The Navy s Goodwill Ambassadors   Seabees built or improved many roads  orphanages and public utilities in many remote parts of the world   1 3  Antarctica  In 1955  Seabees began deploying yearly to the continent of Antarctica  As participants in Operation Deep Freeze  their mission was to build and expand scientific bases located on the frozen continent  The first  wintering over  party included 200 Seabees who distinguished themselves by constructing a 6 000 foot ice runway on McMurdo Sound  Despite a blizzard that once destroyed the entire project  the airstrip was completed in time for the advance party of Deep Freeze II to become the first to arrive at the South Pole by plane   Over the following years and under adverse conditions  Seabees added to their list of accomplishments such things as snow compacted roads  underground storage  laboratories  and living areas  One of the most notable achievements took place in 1962  when the Navy s builders constructed Antarctica s first nuclear power plant  at McMurdo Station   During the Cold War  the Seabees undertook a number of other missions  including constructing the Distant Early Warning Line in the Arctic  Again operating often under extreme conditions  the Seabees successfully completed every mission assigned to them   1 4  Vietnam War  Seabees were deployed to Vietnam throughout the conflict beginning in small numbers in June 1954 and extending to November 1972  By 1962  they began building camps for Special Forces  In June 1965  Construction Mechanic 3rd Class Marvin G  Shields  part of Seabee Team 1104  was actively engaged at the Battle of Dong Xoai and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions there  Shields remains the only Seabee ever to be awarded the Medal of Honor  These  Civic Action Teams  continued into the Vietnam War where Seabees  often fending off enemy forces alongside their Marine and Army counterparts  also built schools and infrastructure and provided health care service  Beginning in 1965  full Seabee battalions  MCBs  and Naval Construction Regiments  NCRs   along with other unit types  were deployed throughout Vietnam  Seabees from the Naval Reserve provided individual personnel early on to augment regular units and two battalions  MCB 12 and MCB 22   In Vietnam  the Seabees supported the Marines and built a staggering number of aircraft support facilities  roads  and bridges  they also paved roads that provided access to farms and markets  supplied fresh water to countless numbers of Vietnamese through hundreds of Seabee dug wells  provided medical treatment to thousands of villagers  and built schools  hospitals  utilities systems  roads and other community facilities  Seabees also worked with and taught construction skills to the Vietnamese people   After Vietnam  the Seabees built and repaired Navy bases in Puerto Rico  Japan  Guam  Greece  Sicily  and Spain  Their civic action projects focused on the Trust Territories of the Pacific   In 1971  the Seabees began their largest peacetime construction on Diego Garcia  a small atoll in the Indian Ocean  This project took 11 years and cost $200 million  The complex accommodates the Navy s largest ships and the biggest military cargo jets  This base proved invaluable when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm were launched   1 5  From the Cold War to terrorism  As the Cold War cooled off  new challenges were presented by the increased incidence of terrorism  Also there were ongoing support missions to Diego Garcia  Guam  Okinawa  Navy and Marine Bases in Japan  the Philippines  Puerto Rico  Guantanamo Bay  Guatemala  the Naval Support Facility for Polaris and Poseidon Submarines in Holy Loch Scotland  Rota Spain  Naples Italy and Suda Bay Crete   Seabee construction efforts led to the expansion and improvement of Naval Air Facility  Sigonella Sicily  turning this into a major base for the Navy’s Sixth Fleet aviation activities   There were combat roles as well  In 1983  a truck bomb demolished the barracks the Marines had secured in Beirut  Lebanon  After moving to the Beirut International Airport and setting up quarters there  Druse militia artillery began harassing the Marines  After consultations with the theater commander and Marine amphibious command and combat engineers  the forward deployed battalion  NMCB 1 in Rota Spain sent in a 70 man AirDet working party with heavy equipment  Construction of artillery resistant quarters went on from December 1983 until the Marines’ withdrawal in February 1984  Only one casualty occurred when an Equipment Operator using a bulldozer to clear fields of fire was wounded by an RPG attack  The Seabee  EO2 Kirt May was awarded the first Purple Heart awarded a Seabee since Vietnam  The Seabees were proud that the Marines had greatly improved protection from ongoing artillery harassment   1 6  Persian Gulf War  During the Persian Gulf War  more than 5 000 Seabees  4 000 active and 1 000 reservists  served in the Middle East  In Saudi Arabia  Seabees built 10 camps for more than 42 000 personnel  14 galleys capable of feeding 75 000 people  and 6 million ft²  600 000 m²  of aircraft parking apron and runways as well as 200+ Helo landing zones  They built and maintained two 500 bed Fleet Hospitals near the port city of Al Jubayl   1 7  Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan  Seabees continue to provide critical construction skills in connection with the effort to rebuild the infrastructure of Afghanistan  All active and reserve Naval Mobile Construction Battalions  NMCBs  and Naval Construction Regiments  NCRs  have been deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan  The Seabees have been deployed since the beginning of the invasion of Iraq in 2003  One of their most high profiles tasks in Iraq has been the removal of statues of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad  In Afghanistan  the Seabees  main task has been the construction of multiple Forward Operating Bases for U S  and coalition forces   1 8  Operation Enduring Freedom Southern Philippines  Since 2002  Seabees have provided critical and tactical construction skills in an effort to win the hearts and minds of locals  Their efforts have begun to deter the rising influence of radical terrorists in the southern Philippines  most notably the Abu Sayyaf s jungle training area  Seabees work along with Army  Marines  and Air Force under Joint Special Operations Task Force Philippines   1 9  Disaster relief and recovery  In 1969 when Hurricane Camile hit the gulf coast  the MCB 121 battalion stationed at Gulfport were called upon for cleanup  rescue  and community outreach for months to come  They fed displaced families and supported the community   Seabees supported disaster recovery efforts for victims of the Northridge earthquake of 1994   In summer 1992  Seabees were called on to provide recovery assistance for Homestead  Florida following Hurricane Andrew  Seabees were also vital to the humanitarian efforts in Somalia during Operation Restore Hope in 1992 1993  In 1994  they were again called on to provide assistance to the Haitian Relief effort at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base  Cuba  On Christmas Day 1995  Seabees arrived in Croatia to support the Army by building camps as part of Operation Joint Endeavor  the peacekeeping effort in Sarajevo  Bosnia Herzegovina  NMCB 40 played a pivotal role serving with the U S  Army 1st Infantry Division  The Big Red One   in assisting with the dismantling of FOB s during the IFOR SFOR phase   On September 23  1998  Hurricane Georges plowed through the Caribbean Islands causing millions of dollars in damage and generating thousands of DRT  disaster recovery team  man hours for the Seabees  The Navy provided generators and water trucks that were taken to nearby cities and damage assessment teams were sent to the local islands   Shortly after Hurricane Georges ravaged Puerto Rico and most of the Caribbean  the Seabees immediately turned their focus towards Hurricane Mitch  which was the most powerful hurricane of the 1998 season  Mitch left more than 17 000 people dead due to the high winds and heavy rains  which led to mud slides that buried thousands in Central America  The Seabees deployed to Honduras participating in operations with Joint Task Force Bravo  providing capabilities to conduct engineer reconnaissance  repair roads and bridges  clear debris  remove bridges  and build base camps  Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 7 was the first Navy element to arrive in Central America taking part in their second humanitarian mission on the deployment   Seabees deployed in September 2004 in response to Hurricane Ivan’s destruction to the Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida  The Seabees cleared hurricane debris  repaired roads  erected tents  and otherwise assisted fellow service members   The Naval Construction Battalion Center in Gulfport  Mississippi  suffered damage during Hurricane Katrina in 2005  Seabees were tasked to rebuild the base and the Gulf Coast   Seabees of Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Seven deployed to provide construction support and disaster relief to Haiti following the earthquake in 2010  Seabee divers from Underwater Construction Team One along with ACB 2 and the Army Engineer divers made repairs to the heavily damaged port facilities in Port au Prince  This resulted in the re opening of the port to allow humanitarian supplies into the country   Seabees from NMCB 133 and Underwater Construction Team Two deployed to Japan as part of the relief effort after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami   Seabees of Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Eleven Air Detachment deployed for roughly two weeks to support federal  state  and local authorities in disaster recovery operations in the New Jersey and New York areas affected by Hurricane Sandy  The Air Detachment mounted out 90 personnel and 94 pieces of civil engineering support equipment including front end loaders  backhoes  pumps  generators  storage containers  and other equipment which was convoyed to the disaster area   2  Organization  2 1  Unit nomenclature  2 1 1  Battalion  The battalion is the fundamental unit of the Naval Construction Force  NCF   Seabee battalions are constituted in such a way as to be self sustaining in the field  The nomenclature for NCF battalions has evolved over the years   1942 to 1949  Naval Construction Battalion  NCB   1949 to 1974  Mobile Construction Battalion  MCB   1974 to present  Naval Mobile Construction Battalion  NMCB  From the early 1960s through 1991  reserve battalions were referred to as Reserve Naval Mobile Construction Battalions  RNMCB   After 1991  all reserve battalions were renamed to NMCB  signifying the integration of the reserve units with the active units of the NCF   2 1 2  Regiment  During the rapid build up of the Seabees during World War II  the number of battalions in a given area increased and larger construction programs were undertaken  This necessitated a higher command echelon to plan  coordinate  and assign the work of several battalions in one area  As a result  Naval Construction Regiments  NCR  were established in December 1942   2 1 3  Brigade  In April 1943  Naval Construction Brigades  NCB  were organized to coordinate the work of regiments  Brigades were the highest NCF command echelon until early in the 21st Century  At that time  the last two brigades were the SECOND Naval Construction Brigade  2nd NCB  and the THIRD Naval Construction Brigade  3rd NCB   The 2nd NCB commanded Atlantic Fleet Seabee units and the 3rd NCB commanded Pacific Fleet Seabee units  Both brigades were decommissioned in August 2002 and are no longer part of the NCF structure   2 1 4  Division  Shortly after the commencement of the Global War on Terror  it was realized that a single command interface for global Seabee operations would be required  On August 9  2002  the FIRST Naval Construction Division  1 NCD  was stood up and commissioned at NAB Little Creek in Virginia  Since January 2006  1NCD has been a subordinate unit of Navy Expeditionary Combat Command  NECC   First Naval Construction Division  1NCD  was decommissioned May 31  2013  The 1NCD staff will be integrated into NECC  Some 1NCD functions have been transferred to the newly created Naval Construction Groups  NCGs  in Gulfport  Mississippi  and Port Hueneme  California  which are now the East and West Coast continuity for the NCF   2 1 5  Specialty Units  2 1 5 1  Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit  CBMU   When first organized during WWII  these units consisted of approximately one fourth the personnel of an NCB and were intended to take over the maintenance of bases on which major construction had been completed  Today  CBMU s provide public works support at Naval Support Activities  Forward Operating Bases  and Fleet Hospital Expeditionary Medical Facilities during wartime or contingency operations  They also provide disaster recovery support to Naval Regional Commanders in CONUS   2 1 5 2  Underwater Construction Team  UCT   UCT s deploy worldwide to conduct underwater construction  inspection  repair  and demolition operations of ocean facilities  to include repair of battle damage  They maintain a capability to support a Fleet Marine Force amphibious assault  subsequent combat service support ashore  and self defense for their camp and facilities under construction   2 1 5 3  Naval Construction Groups  formerly Seabee Readiness Groups  SRG    In 2013  the SRG s were decommissioned  and re formed into Naval Construction Groups ONE and TWO  They are regimental level command groups tasked with administrative and tactical control of Seabee Battalions  as well as conducting pre deployment training of NCF units in the NCG s respective homeport locations  Currently  Naval Construction Group TWO  NCG 2  is based at CBC Gulfport  and Naval Construction Group ONE  NCG ONE  is based at CBC Port Hueneme   2 1 5 4  Amphibious Construction Battalion  ACB   ACB s  also abbreviated as PHIBCB  evolved out of pontoon assembly battalions formed as part of the Seabees during World War II  After the war  these battalions  originally MCBs 104 and 105  were renamed ACB s and assigned to Naval Beach Groups   Today  while the ACBs are part of the NCF  they do not report to 1 NCD  instead reporting to surface TYCOMs  Additionally  the ACBs have a different personnel mix than an NMCB with half the enlisted personnel being traditional Seabee rates and the other half being fleet rates  See Amphibious Construction Battalion One  Amphibious Construction Battalion Two for more detail   2 1 6  Obsolete units  NCF unit types that are no longer in use include   Naval Construction Force Support Unit  NCFSU   Construction Battalion Unit  CBU   Construction Detachments  CBD   Pontoon Assembly Detachments  PAD   Seabee Readiness Groups  2 2  Training  The newcomers begin  A  School  preliminary training  fresh out of boot camp  or they come from the fleet after their service term is met  spending about 75% of the twelve weeks immersed in hands on training  The remaining 25% is spent in classroom instruction  From  A  School  new Seabees most often report to an NMCB command for their first tour of duty  For training  the new Seabees attend a four week course known as Expeditionary Combat Skills  ECS  at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Gulfport  Mississippi  and Port Hueneme  California  ECS is also being taught to all personnel who report to a unit in the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command  ECS is a basic combat skills course where the students spend time in a classroom environment learning map reading and land navigation  battlefield first aid  how to lay out defensive plans  how to conduct patrols  vehicle egress  and many other combat related skills  Half of each course is spent at a rifle range where students learn basic rifle marksmanship and then qualify with the M16A2 and M16A3 service rifles  ECS students also learn fundamentals of the M9 service pistol and qualify  At the end of training  new Seabees are ready to perform with their new battalion  During their tenure with an NMCB  personnel may be assigned to a crew served weapon  such as the MK 19 40 mm machine gun  the M2HB  50 caliber machine gun  or the M240 machine gun  Many reserve units still field variants of the M60 machine gun  Until 2012  Seabees wore the Woodland camouflage uniform or the legacy tri color Desert Camouflage Uniform  the last members of the entire U S  military to do so  but are now transitioning to the NWU Type III  Seabees use ALICE field gear as well as some units working with Marines use USMC issue ILBE gear   About one third of new Seabees are assigned to Public Works Departments  PWD  at naval installations both within the United States and overseas  While stationed at a Public Works Department  a Seabee has the opportunity to get specialized training and extensive experience in one or more facets of their rating   2 3  Ratings  There are seven source ratings for the Seabee community   Construction Mechanic  CM   Equipment Operator  EO   Utilitiesman  UT   Construction Electrician  CE   Builder  BU     Steelworker  SW   Engineering Aide  EA   2 4  Badge  The military qualification badge for the Seabees is known as the Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist insignia  SCW   It is issued to both officers and enlisted personnel and recognizes those who have been fully trained and qualified as a member of the various Naval Construction Force  NCF  units  Only members attached to a qualifying NCF unit are eligible for the SCWs pin  The qualifying units include  Naval Mobile Construction Battalions  NMCB   Amphibious Construction Battalions  ACB   Naval Construction Force Support Units  NCFSU   Underwater Construction Teams  UCT   and  since the end of 2008  Naval Construction Regiments  NCR    The SCWs insignia has been in existence since it was officially approved for use in 1993   2 5  Ranks  The ranks of E 1 through E 3 in the Navy include Seaman  white stripes   Airman  green stripes   and Fireman  red stripes   E 1 through E 3 Seabees use the designation Constructionman and wear sky blue stripes on their dress and service uniforms   3  Logo  Frank J  Iafrate  a civilian plan file clerk at Naval Air Station Quonset Point  Rhode Island  was the artist who designed the original Seabee logo   Fighting  Bee   in early 1942  The logo has remained in use  unchanged  In late 1942  after designing the logo  he enlisted in the Seabees   During World War II  artists working for Walt Disney designed logos for about ten Naval Construction units  including the 60th Naval  Canal  Construction Battalion and the 133rd Naval Construction Battalion  in 1943   4  Music  The  Song of the Seabees  was written in 1943  The lyrics were composed by Sam M  Lewis  and the musical composition was written by Peter DeRose  The first verse of the song  however  is usually the only verse to be sung or played at official functions   5  Miscellany  Robert Stethem was murdered by the Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah when they hijacked TWA Flight 847 in 1985  Stethem was a Steelworker Second Class  SW2   a Seabee diver and member of Underwater Construction Team ONE  The USS Stethem  DDG 63  is named in his honor  On August 24  2010  onboard USS Stethem in Yokosuka  Japan  Stethem was posthumously made an honorary Master Chief Constructionman  CUCM  by the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy   6  Museums  The U S  Navy Seabee Museum is located at Naval Base Ventura County  California  The new museum—built by Carlsbad based opened on July 22  2011  located outside the base itself  near the entrance to the Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme  California  Due to the location  visitors are able to visit the museum without having to enter the base itself   The design of the single story  38 833 square foot structure was inspired by the Seabee Quonset Hut  Inside are galleries for exhibition space  a grand hall  a theater for 45 people  collections storage  and research areas   On February 7  2011  the museum was certified as LEED Silver for utilizing a number of sustainable design and construction strategies  Features include the use of low maintenance landscaping  a “cool” roofing system with high solar reflectance and thermal emittance  use of photocell controlled light fixtures and energy efficient lighting fixtures  30% use of regional materials and 80% construction debris was recycled and diverted from landfills  low Volatile Organic Compounds  VOCs   and  use of dual flush toilets and low flow aerator faucets   The   in Davisville  Rhode Island  was opened in the late 1990s by a group of former Seabees  The Fighting Seabee Statue is located here   The Seabee Heritage Center is located in Building 446 at the Naval Construction Battalion Center  Gulfport  Mississippi   The Heritage Center is the Atlantic Coast Annex of the Seabee Museum in Port Hueneme  Opened in 1995  the Museum Annex commemorates the history and achievements of the Atlantic Coast Naval Construction Force  Seabees  and the Navy s Civil Engineer Corps  Exhibits at the Gulfport Annex are provided by the Seabee Museum in Port Hueneme   7  In popular culture  The 1944 war film The Fighting Seabees  starring John Wayne  tells a heavily fictionalized story of the formation of the Seabees and their first taste of combat   Al Borland from the television show Home Improvement was a Navy Seabee   Ward Cleaver from the television show Leave it to Beaver was a Navy Seabee   Ben Walton from the television show The Waltons was a Navy Seabee   South Pacific features a group of Seabees   The 1998 videogame  Grim Fandango  set in the Mexican Land of the Dead  has ship workers who are anthropomorphized bees   8  See also  Rhino ferry  Military engineer  Military
