Sir Frederick William Herschel  KH  FRS  German  Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel  15 November 1738 – 25 August 1822  was a German born British astronomer  composer  and brother of Caroline Herschel  Born in the Electorate of Hanover  Herschel followed his father into the Military Band of Hanover  before migrating to Great Britain at the age of nineteen   Herschel became interested in astronomy in 1773  and after constructing his first large telescope in 1774  he spent nine years carrying out thorough sky surveys  where his purpose was the investigation of double stars  The resolving power of the Herschel telescopes revealed that the nebulae in the Messier catalogue were clusters of stars  catalogues of nebulae were published in 1802  2 500 objects  and 1820  5 000 objects   In the course of an observation on 13 March 1781 he realized that one celestial body he had observed was not a star  but a planet  Uranus  This was the first planet to be discovered since antiquity and Herschel became famous overnight  As a result of this discovery George III appointed him  Court Astronomer   He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society and grants were provided for the construction of new telescopes   Herschel pioneered the use of astronomical spectrophotometry as a diagnostic tool  using prisms and temperature measuring equipment to measure the wavelength distribution of stellar spectra  Other work included an improved determination of the rotation period of Mars  the discovery that the Martian polar caps vary seasonally  the discovery of Titania and Oberon  moons of Uranus  and Enceladus and Mimas  moons of Saturn   In addition  he was the first person to discover the existence of infrared radiation  Herschel was knighted in 1816  He died in August 1822  and his work was continued by his only son  John Herschel   1  Early life and musical activities  Herschel was born in the Electorate of Hanover in Germany   part of the Holy Roman Empire  one of ten children of Isaac Herschel by his marriage to Anna Ilse Moritzen  His family were Lutheran Christians  The surname  although suggesting a Jewish origin  is descended from Protestant Christians as far back as genealogists can trace  His father was an oboist in the Hanover Military Band  In 1755 the Hanoverian Guards regiment  in whose band Wilhelm and his brother Jakob were engaged as oboists  was ordered to England  At the time the crowns of Great Britain and Hanover were united under King George II  As the threat of war with France loomed  the Hanoverian Guards were recalled from England to defend Hanover  After they were defeated at the Battle of Hastenbeck  Herschel s father Isaak sent his two sons to seek refuge in England in late 1757  Although his older brother Jakob had received his dismissal from the Hanoverian Guards  Wilhelm was accused of desertion  for which he was pardoned by George III in 1782   Wilhelm  nineteen years old at this time  was a quick student of the English language  In England he went by the English rendition of his name  Frederick William Herschel   In addition to the oboe  he played the violin and harpsichord and later the organ  He composed numerous musical works  including 24 symphonies and many concertos  as well as some church music  Six of his symphonies were recorded in April 2002 by the London Mozart Players  conducted by Matthias Bamert  Chandos 10048    Herschel moved to Sunderland in 1761 when Charles Avison immediately engaged him as first violin and soloist for his Newcastle orchestra  where he played for one season  In ‘Sunderland in the County of Durh  apprill  sic  20th 1761’ he wrote his symphony No  8 in c minor  He was head of the Durham Militia band 1760–61 and visited the home of Sir Ralph Milbanke at Halnaby Hall in 1760  where he wrote two symphonies  as well as giving performances himself   After Newcastle he moved to Leeds and Halifax where he was the first organist at St John the Baptist church  now Halifax Minster   He became organist of the Octagon Chapel  Bath  a fashionable chapel in a well known spa  in which city he was also Director of Public Concerts  He was appointed as the organist in 1766 and gave his introductory concert on 1 January 1767  As the organ was still incomplete he showed off his versatility by performing his own compositions including a violin concerto  an oboe concerto and a harpsichord sonata  The organ was completed in October 1767  His sister Caroline came to England in 1772 and lived with him there in New King Street  Bath  The house they shared is now the location of the Herschel Museum of Astronomy  His brothers Dietrich  Alexander and Jakob  1734–1792  also appeared as musicians of Bath  In 1780  Herschel was appointed director of the Bath orchestra  with his sister often appearing as soprano soloist   2  Astronomy  Herschel s music led him to an interest in mathematics and lenses  His interest in astronomy grew stronger after he made the acquaintance of the English Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne  He started building his own reflecting telescopes and would spend up to 16 hours a day grinding and polishing the speculum metal primary mirrors  He  began to look at the planets and the stars  in May 1773 and on 1 March 1774 began an astronomical journal by noting his observations of Saturn s rings and the Great Orion Nebula  M 42    2 1  Double stars  Herschel s early observational work soon focused on the search for pairs of stars that were very close together visually  Astronomers of the era expected that changes over time in the apparent separation and relative location of these stars would provide evidence for both the proper motion of stars and  by means of parallax shifts in their separation  for the distance of stars from the Earth  a method first suggested by Galileo Galilei   From the back garden of his house in New King Street  Bath  and using a    f 13  Newtonian telescope  with a most capital speculum  of his own manufacture  in October 1779  Herschel began a systematic search for such stars among  every star in the Heavens   with new discoveries listed through 1792  He soon discovered many more binary and multiple stars than expected  and compiled them with careful measurements of their relative positions in two catalogues presented to the Royal Society in London in 1782  269 double or multiple systems  and 1784  434 systems   A third catalogue of discoveries made after 1783 was published in 1821  145 systems    In 1797 Herschel measured many of the systems again  and discovered changes in their relative positions that could not be attributed to the parallax caused by the Earth s orbit  He waited until 1802  in Catalogue of 500 new Nebulae  nebulous Stars  planetary Nebulae  and Clusters of Stars  with Remarks on the Construction of the Heavens  to announce the hypothesis that the two stars might be  binary sidereal systems  orbiting under mutual gravitational attraction  a hypothesis he confirmed in 1803 in his Account of the Changes that have happened  during the last Twenty five Years  in the relative Situation of Double stars  with an Investigation of the Cause to which they are owing  In all  Herschel discovered over 800 confirmed double or multiple star systems  almost all of them physical rather than virtual pairs  His theoretical and observational work provided the foundation for modern binary star astronomy  new catalogues adding to his work were not published until after 1820 by Friedrich Wilhelm Struve  James South and John Herschel   2 2  Uranus  In March 1781  during his search for double stars  Herschel noticed an object appearing as a nonstellar disk  Herschel originally thought it was a comet or a star  He made many more observations of it  and afterwards Russian Academician Anders Lexell computed the orbit and found it to be probably planetary  Herschel determined in agreement that it must be a planet beyond the orbit of Saturn  He called the new planet the  Georgian star   Georgium sidus  after King George III  which also brought him favour  the name did not stick  In France  where reference to the British king was to be avoided if possible  the planet was known as  Herschel  until the name  Uranus  was universally adopted  The same year  Herschel was awarded the Copley Medal and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society  In 1782  he was appointed  The King’s Astronomer   not to be confused with the Astronomer Royal   He and his sister subsequently moved to Datchet  then in Buckinghamshire but now in Berkshire  on 1 August 1782  He continued his work as a telescope maker and achieved an international reputation for their manufacture  profitably selling over 60 completed reflectors to British and Continental astronomers   2 3  Deep sky surveys  From 1782 to 1802  and most intensively from 1783 to 1790  Herschel conducted systematic surveys in search of  deep sky  or nonstellar objects with two   and telescopes  in combination with his favoured 6 inch aperture instrument   Excluding duplicated and  lost  entries  Herschel ultimately discovered over 2400 objects defined by him as nebulae   At that time  nebula was the generic term for any visually extended or diffuse astronomical object  including galaxies beyond the Milky Way  until galaxies were confirmed as extragalactic systems by Edwin Hubble in 1924    Herschel published his discoveries as three catalogues  Catalogue of One Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars  1786   Catalogue of a Second Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars  1789  and the previously cited Catalogue of 500 New Nebulae      1802   He arranged his discoveries under eight  classes    I  bright nebulae   II  faint nebulae   III  very faint nebulae   IV  planetary nebulae   V  very large nebulae   VI  very compressed and rich clusters of stars   VII  compressed clusters of small and large  faint and bright  stars  and  VIII  coarsely scattered clusters of stars  Herschel s discoveries were supplemented by those of Caroline Herschel  11 objects  and his son John Herschel  1754 objects  and published by him as General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters in 1864  This catalogue was later edited by John Dreyer  supplemented with discoveries by many other 19th century astronomers  and published in 1888 as the New General Catalogue  abbreviated NGC  of 7840 deep sky objects  The NGC numbering is still the most commonly used identifying label for these celestial landmarks   2 4  Work with his sister Caroline  In 1783 he gave Caroline a telescope  and she began to make astronomical discoveries in her own right  particularly comets  She discovered or observed eight comets  eleven nebulae and  at her brother s suggestion  updated and corrected Flamsteed s work detailing the position of stars  This was published as the British Catalogue of Stars  She was honoured by the Royal Astronomical Society for this work  Caroline also continued to serve as his assistant  often taking notes while he observed at the telescope   In June 1785  owing to damp conditions  he and Caroline moved to Clay Hall in Old Windsor  In 1786  the Herschels moved to a new residence on Windsor Road in Slough  He lived the rest of his life in this residence  which came to be known as Observatory House  It is no longer standing   On 7 May 1788  he married the widow Mary Pitt  née Baldwin  at St Laurence s Church  Upton in Slough  His sister Caroline then moved to separate lodgings  but continued to work as his assistant   2 5  Herschel s telescopes  During his career  he constructed more than four hundred telescopes  The largest and most famous of these was a reflecting telescope with a primary mirror and a 40 foot  12 m  focal length  Because of the poor reflectivity of the speculum mirrors of that day  Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror of a standard newtonian reflector from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly  This design has come to be called the Herschelian telescope  On 28 August 1789  his first night of observation using this instrument  he discovered a new moon of Saturn  A second moon followed within the first month of observation  The  40 foot telescope  proved very cumbersome  and most of his observations were done with a smaller reflector  Herschel discovered that unfilled telescope apertures can be used to obtain high angular resolution  something which became the essential basis for interferometric imaging in astronomy  in particular Aperture Masking Interferometry and hypertelescopes    2 5 1  Reconstruction of the 20ft telescope  In 2012  the BBC Stargazing Live television programme built a replica of the 20 foot telescope using Herschel s original plans but modern materials  It is to be considered a close modern approximation rather than an exact replica  A modern glass mirror was used  the frame uses metal scaffolding and the tube is a sewer pipe  The telescope was shown on the programme in January 2013 and stands on the art  design and technology campus of the University of Derby where it will be used for educational purposes   2 6  Life on other celestial bodies  Herschel was sure that he had found ample evidence of life on the Moon and compared it to the English countryside  He did not refrain himself from theorizing that the other planets were populated  with an special interest in Mars  which was competely in line with most of his contemporary scientists  At Herschel s time  scientists tended to believe in a plurality of civilized worlds  while most religious thinkers referred to unique properties of the earth  Herschel went so far to speculate that the interior of the sun was populated   2 7  Sunspots  climate  and wheat yields  Herschel started to examine the correlation of solar variation and solar cycle and climate  Over a period of 40 years  1779–1818   Herschel had regularly observed sunspots and their variations in number  form and size  Most of his observations took place in a period of low solar activity  the Dalton minimum  Therefore solar activity behaved very unusually  This was one of the reasons why Herschel was not able to identify the standard 11 year period in solar activity  Herschel compared his observations with the series of wheat prices published by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations   1801 Herschel reported his findings to the Royal Society and indicated five prolonged periods of few sunspots correlated with costly wheat  Herschel s study was ridiculed by some of his contemporaries but did initiate further attempts to find a correlation  Later in the 19th century  William Stanley Jevons proposed the 11 year  cycle and Herschels basic idea of a correlation between low amount of sunspots and lower yields to explain for recurring booms and slumps in the economy  Herschels speculation on a connection between sunspots and regional climate  using the market price of wheat as a proxy continues to be cited regularly till today   According a study of the Israel Cosmic Ray Center about the influence of solar activity on the historical wheat market in England  all ten solar cycles between 1600 and 1700 show high wheat prices coinciding with low activity  and vice versa  The topic is still subject of controversies and the significance of the correlation is being doubted by some scientists   2 8  Further discoveries  In his later career  Herschel discovered two moons of Saturn  Mimas and Enceladus  as well as two moons of Uranus  Titania and Oberon  He did not give these moons their names  they were named by his son John in 1847 and 1852  respectively  after his death   In 2007 evidence was cited by Dr  Stuart Eves that Herschel might have discovered rings around Uranus   Herschel measured the axial tilt of Mars and discovered that the martian ice caps  first observed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini  1666  and Christiaan Huygens  1672   changed size with the planet s seasons   From studying the proper motion of stars  he was the first to realise that the solar system is moving through space  and he determined the approximate direction of that movement  He also studied the structure of the Milky Way and concluded that it was in the shape of a disk  He incorrectly assumed the sun was in the centre of the disc  a theory known as Galactocentrism  which was eventually corrected by the findings of Harlow Shapley in 1918   He also coined the word  asteroid   meaning star like  from the Greek asteroeides  aster  star  +  eidos  form  shape    in 1802  shortly after Olbers discovered the second minor planet  2 Pallas  in late March   to describe the star like appearance of the small moons of the giant planets and of the minor planets  the planets all show discs  by comparison  By the 1850s  asteroid  became a standard term for describing certain minor planets   3  Discovery of infrared radiation in sunlight  On 11 February 1800  Herschel was testing filters for the sun so he could observe sun spots  When using a red filter he found there was a lot of heat produced  Herschel discovered infrared radiation in sunlight by passing it through a prism and holding a thermometer just beyond the red end of the visible spectrum  This thermometer was meant to be a control to measure the ambient air temperature in the room  He was shocked when it showed a higher temperature than the visible spectrum  Further experimentation led to Herschel s conclusion that there must be an invisible form of light beyond the visible spectrum   4  Biology  Herschel used a microscope to establish that coral was not a plant  as many believed at the time  since it lacked the cell walls characteristic of plants   5  Family and death  William Herschel and Mary had one child  John  born at Observatory House on 7 March 1792  William s personal background and rise as man of science had a profound impact on the upbringing of his son and grandchildren  He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788  In 1816  William was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order by the Prince Regent and was accorded the honorary title  Sir  although this was not the equivalent of an official British knighthood  He helped to found the Astronomical Society of London in 1820  which in 1831 received a royal charter and became the Royal Astronomical Society  In 1813  he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences   On 25 August 1822  Herschel died at Observatory House  Windsor Road  Slough  and is buried at nearby St Laurence s Church  Upton  Slough  Herschel s epitaph is  Herschel s son John Herschel also became a famous astronomer  One of William s brothers  Alexander Herschel  moved permanently to England  near his sister Caroline and nephew John  Caroline returned to Hanover after the death of her brother  She died on 9 January 1848   His house at 19 New King Street in Bath  Somerset where he made many telescopes and first observed Uranus  is now home to the Herschel Museum of Astronomy   6  Memorial  William Herschel lived most of his life in Slough  a town then in Buckinghamshire  He died in the town and was buried under the tower of the Church of St Laurence  Upton cum Chalvey  near Slough  Herschel is very much respected in the town and there are several memorials to him and his discoveries   In 2011 a new bus station  the design of which was inspired by the infrared experiment of William Herschel  was built in the centre of Slough   7  Musical works  Herschel s complete musical works were as follows   18 symphonies for small orchestra  1760–1762   6 symphonies for large orchestra  1762–1764   12 concertos for oboe  violin and viola  1759–1764   2 concertos for organ  6 sonatas for violin  cello and harpsichord  published 1769   12 solos for violin and basso continuo
