In metaphysics  the problem of universals refers to the question of whether properties exist  and if so  what they are  Properties are qualities or relations that two or more entities have in common  The various kinds of properties  such as qualities and relations are referred to as universals  For instance  one can imagine three cup holders on a table that have in common the quality of being circular or exemplifying circularity  or two daughters that have in common being the daughter of Frank  There are many such properties  such as being human  red  male or female  liquid  big or small  taller than  father of  etc   While philosophers agree that human beings talk and think about properties  they disagree on whether these universals exist in reality or merely in thought and speech   1  Positions  The main positions on the issue are generally considered to be  realism  nominalism  and idealism  sometimes simply called  anti realism  with regard to universals    1 1  Realism  The realist school claims that universals are real — they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them  There are various forms of realism  Two major forms are Platonic realism  universalia ante res  and Aristotelian realism  universalia in rebus   Platonic realism is the view that universals are real entities and they exist independent of particulars  Aristotelian realism  on the other hand  is the view that universals are real entities  but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them   Realists tend to argue that universals must be posited as distinct entities in order to account for various phenomena  For example  a common realist argument  arguably found in Plato  is that universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false  Take the sentence  Djivan Gasparyan is a musician   The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual  Djivan Gasparyan  who possesses a certain quality  musicianship  Thus it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property   1 2  Nominalism  Nominalists assert that only individuals or particulars exist and deny that universals are real  i e  that they exist as entities or beings   The term  nominalism  comes from the Latin nomen   name    since the nominalist philosopher agrees that we predicate the same property of multiple entities but argues that the entities only share a name  not a real quality  in common  There are various forms of nominalism  which is sometimes also referred to as  terminism    three major forms are resemblance nominalism  conceptualism  and trope nominalism  Nominalism has been endorsed or defended by many  including William of Ockham  Peter Abelard  D  C  Williams  1953   David Lewis  1983   and arguably H  H  Price  1953  and W  V  O  Quine  1961    Nominalists often argue for their view by claiming that nominalism can account for all the relevant phenomena  and therefore—by Occam s razor or some sort of principle of simplicity—nominalism is preferable  since it posits fewer entities  Whether nominalism can truly account for all of the relevant phenomena is debated   1 3  Idealism  Idealists  such as Kant and Hegel  posit that universals are not real  but are ideas in the mind of rational beings  Idealists do not reject universals as arbitrary names  rather  they treat universals as fundamental categories of pure reason  or as secondary concepts derived from those fundamental categories   Universals  in idealism  are intrinsically tied to the rationality of the subject making the judgment   For instance  when someone judges that two cup holders are both circular they are not noticing a mind independent thing   circularity   that is in both objects  nor are they simply applying a name   circular   to both  Rather  they partially constitute the very concept of cup holder by supplying it with the concept of circularity  which already exists as an idea in their rational mind   Thus  for idealists  the problem of universals is only tangentially a metaphysical problem  it is more of a problem of psychology and epistemology   2  Ancient thought  2 1  Plato  Plato believed there to be a sharp distinction between the world of perceivable objects and the world of universals or forms  one can only have mere opinions about the former  but one can have knowledge about the latter  For Plato it was not possible to have knowledge of anything that could change or was particular  since knowledge had to be forever unfailing and general  For that reason  the world of the forms is the real world  like sunlight  the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real  like shadows  This Platonic realism  however  in denying that the eternal Forms are mental artifacts  differs sharply with modern forms of idealism   One of the first nominalist critiques of Plato s realism was that of Diogenes of Sinope  who said  I ve seen Plato s cups and table  but not his cupness and tableness    2 2  Aristotle  Plato s student Aristotle disagreed with his tutor  Aristotle transformed Plato s forms into  formal causes   the blueprints or essences of individual things  Whereas Plato idealized geometry  Aristotle emphasized nature and related disciplines and therefore much of his thinking concerns living beings and their properties  The nature of universals in Aristotle s philosophy therefore hinges on his view of natural kinds   Consider for example a particular oak tree  This is a member of a species and it has much in common with other oak trees  past  present and future  Its universal  its oakness  is a part of it  A biologist can study oak trees and learn about oakness and more generally the intelligible order within the sensible world  Accordingly  Aristotle was more confident than Plato about coming to know the sensible world  he was a prototypical empiricist and a founder of induction  Aristotle was a new  moderate sort of realist about universals   3  Medieval thought  3 1  Boethius  The problem was introduced to the medieval world by Boethius  by his translation of Porphyry s Isagoge  It begins    I shall omit to speak about genera and species  as to whether they subsist  in the nature of things  or in mere conceptions only  whether also if subsistent  they are bodies or incorporeal  and whether they are separate from  or in  sensibles  and subsist about these  for such a treatise is most profound  and requires another more extensive investigation    3 2  Duns Scotus  Duns Scotus argued strongly against both nominalism and conceptualism  arguing instead for Scotist realism  a medieval response to the conceptualism of Abelard   3 3  Ockham  William of Ockham argued strongly that universals are a product of abstract human thought  According to Ockham  universals are just words names that only exist in the mind and have no real place in the external world   3 4  Medieval realism  Realism was argued for by both Thomas Aquinas and John Duns Scotus  Aquinas argued that both the essence of a thing and its existence were clearly distinct  in this regard he is close to the teaching of Aristotle  Scotist realism argues that in a thing there is no real distinction between the essence and the existence  instead there is only a Formal distinction  Both these opinions were denied by Scotus  pupil William of Ockham   3 5  Medieval nominalism  Nominalism was first formulated as a philosophical theory in the Middle Ages  The French philosopher and theologian Roscellinus  c  1050 c  1125  was an early  prominent proponent of this view  It can be found in the work of Peter Abelard and reached its flowering in William of Ockham  who was the most influential and thorough nominalist  Abelard s and Ockham s version of nominalism is sometimes called conceptualism  which presents itself as a middle way between nominalism and realism  asserting that there is something in common among like individuals  but that it is a concept in the mind  rather than a real entity existing independently of the mind  Ockham argued that only individuals existed and that universals were only mental ways of referring to sets of individuals   I maintain   he wrote   that a universal is not something real that exists in a subject    but that it has a being only as a thought object in the mind  objectivum in anima    As a general rule  Ockham argued against assuming any entities that were not necessary for explanations  Accordingly  he wrote  there is no reason to believe that there is an entity called  humanity  that resides inside  say  Socrates  and nothing further is explained by making this claim  This is in accord with the analytical method which has since come to be called Ockham s razor  the principle that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible   Critics argue that conceptualist approaches only answer the psychological question of universals  If the same concept is correctly and non arbitrarily applied to two individuals  there must be some resemblance or shared property between the two individuals that justifies their falling under the same concept and that is just the metaphysical problem that universals were brought in to address  the starting point of the whole problem  MacLeod & Rubenstein  2006  §3d   If resemblances between individuals are asserted  conceptualism becomes moderate realism  if they are denied  it collapses into nominalism   4  Modern and contemporary views  4 1  Berkeley  George Berkeley  best known for his empiricism  was also an advocate of an extreme nominalism  Indeed  he disbelieved even in the possibility of a general thought as a psychological fact  It is impossible to imagine a man  the argument goes  unless one has in mind a very specific picture of one who is either tall or short  European  African or Asian  blue eyed or brown eyed  et cetera  When one thinks of a triangle  likewise  it is always obtuse  right angled or acute  There is no mental image of a triangle in general  Not only then do general terms fail to correspond to extra mental realities  they don t correspond to thoughts either   Berkeleyan nominalism contributed to the same thinker s critique of the possibility of matter  In the climate of English thought in the period following Isaac Newton s major contributions to physics  there was much discussion of a distinction between primary qualities and secondary qualities  The primary qualities were supposed to be true of material objects in themselves  size  position  momentum  whereas the secondary qualities were supposed to be more subjective  color and sound   But on Berkeley s view  just as it is meaningless to speak of triangularity in general aside from specific figures  so it is meaningless to speak of mass in motion without knowing the color  If the color is in the eye of the beholder  so is the mass   Berkeley s great contribution  picked up on later by Kant  was to suggest the preposterousness of referencing absolute knowledge  given that all knowledge is gained through contingent sensory experience  In fact  the very notion of finding coherence and permanence within sensory experience was so preposterous to him  that he had to postulate the notion of a God who holds all reality in HIS mind  in order to explain why the world doesn t just vanish when we stop perceiving it  He was forced  by his extreme empiricism  to posit the existence of God in order to explain our experience of coherence  even though on an empirical understanding of raw sense data  such a conclusion did not follow  In this  he demonstrates the importance and brilliance of Kant s  Copernican revolution  in epistemology that was to follow  For without Kant  Berkeley was not able to give an account of the coherence of our experience that squared with his empiricism  David Hume tried to give such an account when he proposed that concepts are merely the faded memories of sensory experiences had over and over again  like writing on a page which eventually sinks through to the underlying pages  But this account seemed to threaten the very possibility of science as an objective endeavor and made Kant  himself a scientist  very uneasy  It forced Kant to come up with his theory of noumenal objects as unverifiable but understandable extensions of our immediate sensory experience constructed according to the inherent schemae of our understanding  Thus  in place of God s role as guarantor of the coherence of the world  Kant posits a faculty of reason structured by the forms of our intuition  our sense of time and space  and the categories of our understanding  like the notion of cause and effect    4 2  Kant  Idealism is a broad category that includes several diverse themes  from Kant s radical doubt about what can truly be perceived externally to Hegel s Absolute Ideal as the verification of the sum of potential manifestations of matter and concepts  This position argues that the nature of reality is based only in our minds or ideas  and represents one of several divergent interpretations of Kant’s legacy  On Hegel’s view  the external world is inseparable from the mind  consciousness or perceptions  Universals are real and exist independently of that on which they might be predicated   But to conflate Kant s and Hegel s versions of idealism is to seriously miss the point of Kant’s radical doubt  which was stimulated in turn by David Hume s  Kant claimed it was Hume’s skepticism about the nature of inductive reasoning and the conclusions of rationalist metaphysicians  Descartes  Spinoza  Leibniz  that  roused him from his dogmatic  i e  rationalist  slumbers  and spurred him on to one of the most far reaching re evaluations of human reason since Aristotle  Following Aristotle’s lead  Kant considered that knowledge can only be had through experience of particulars  Given that premise  the notion of absolute knowledge  as described by Plato and the rationalists  is seen as mere illusion  and this is what he set out to demonstrate in the first part of his magnum opus  The Critique of Pure Reason   1781   He claims to demonstrate that because knowledge can only be had through contingent  imperfect  experience  the notion of absolute  uncontingent knowledge must not actually be obtainable  but must function merely as a “regulative principle” or heuristic device for problem solving  Thus we can conceive of a “noumenal” world  noumenal meaning  object of thought   which exists only as a heuristic for our cognitive capacities and not as something directly accessible to experience  The noumenal world for Kant is the way “things in themselves” might appear to a being of uncontingent reason  i e  “God”    The “phenomenal” world  on the other hand is the world of experience  in which we live and in which objects are given to reason in experience  Our understanding of the phenomenal world is inevitably “colored” by the imperfections  or restrictions  of the knowing apparatus  and this is what he set out to describe in the first part of the 1st Critique  Following Aristotle’s lead  he describes categories of the understanding  such as the notion of cause and effect  which inevitably mediate our experience of the world and give us the objects of our experience  The objects “in themselves” as they might appear in their “universal” or “absolute” nature are forever hidden from us  and thus Kant effectively rules out the type of access to the world of the forms that had been formulated by Plato  The notion of the noumenal can only function as a heuristic of reason  not as an actual something to be experienced by contingent beings  Thus Kant effects his “Copernican” revolution of knowledge by changing our perspective on knowledge from a question of “what can truly be known”  i e  how can we actually come to know universals   to a question of “how does the knowing mind operate ” As with Copernicus  the data remains the same but the model used to encounter the data shifts tremendously   After Kant  the problem of universals becomes a problem of human psychology and questions about conceptual models we use to understand universals  rather than the same old metaphysical arguments about what universals “really” are  The second part of the 1st Critique is Kant’s examination of the rationalist claims to absolute knowledge  taking on the most famous of these  the ontological proof of God’s existence  and showing that he can  through pure  non experiential logic  both prove the affirmative and the negative of a proposition about a “noumenal object”  i e  an object like “God” which can never be an object of direct experience for a contingent being   Given that both A and not A are seen to be “true ” Kant concludes that it’s not that “God doesn’t exist” but that there is something wrong with how we are asking questions about God and how we have been using our rational faculties to talk about universals ever since Plato got us started on this track  He goes on  in subsequent Critiques and other works  to demonstrate his model for the proper use of concepts like “God” “the Good ” and “the beautiful ” effecting the most radical re evaluation of these ideas since Plato  and changing forever the course of western philosophy  It is perhaps no small exaggeration to claim that most western philosophers since Kant  even if they disagree with him  have had to find some way to respond to his revolutionary ideas   4 3  Mill  John Stuart Mill discussed the problem of universals in the course of a book that eviscerated the philosophy of Sir William Hamilton  Mill wrote   The formation of a concept does not consist in separating the attributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes of the same object and enabling us to conceive those attributes  disjoined from any others  We neither conceive them  nor think them  nor cognize them in any way  as a thing apart  but solely as forming  in combination with numerous other attributes  the idea of an individual object    However  he then proceeds to state that Berkeley s position is factually wrong by stating the following   In other words  we may be  temporarily unconscious  of whether an image is white  black or yellow and concentrate our attention on the fact that it is a man and on just those attributes necessary to identify it as a man  but not as any particular one   It may then have the significance of a universal of manhood   4 4  Peirce  The 19th century American logician Charles Sanders Peirce  known as the father of pragmatism  developed his own views on the problem of universals in the course of a review of an edition of the writings of George Berkeley  Peirce begins with the observation that  Berkeley s metaphysical theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop   He includes among these paradoxical doctrines Berkeley s denial of  the possibility of forming the simplest general conception   He wrote that if there is some mental fact that works in practice the way that a universal would  that fact is a universal   If I have learned a formula in gibberish which in any way jogs my memory so as to enable me in each single case to act as though I had a general idea  what possible utility is there in distinguishing between such a gibberish    and an idea   Peirce also held as a matter of ontology that what he called  thirdness   the more general facts about the world  are extra mental realities   4 5  James  William James learned pragmatism  this way of understanding an idea by its practical effects  from his friend Peirce  but he gave it new significance   Which was not to Peirce s taste   he came to complain that James had  kidnapped  the term and eventually to call himself a  pragmaticist  instead   Although James certainly agreed with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact  he was a nominalist in his ontology   There are at least three ways in which a realist might try to answer James  challenge of explaining the reason why universal conceptions are more lofty than those of particulars   there is the moral political answer  the mathematical scientific answer and the anti paradoxical answer  Each has contemporary or near contemporary advocates   The moral or political response is given by the conservative philosopher Richard M  Weaver in Ideas Have Consequences  where he describes how the acceptance of  the fateful doctrine of nominalism  was  the crucial event in the history of Western culture  from this flowed those acts which issue now in modern decadence    Roger Penrose contends that the foundations of mathematics can t be understood absent the Platonic view that  mathematical truth is absolute  external and eternal  and not based on man made criteria     mathematical objects have a timeless existence of their own      Nino Cocchiarella  1975   professor emeritus of philosophy at Indiana University  has maintained that conceptual realism is the best response to certain logical paradoxes to which nominalism leads  It is noted that in a sense Cocchiarella has adopted Platonism for anti Platonic reasons  Plato  as seen in the dialogue Parmenides  was willing to accept a certain amount of paradox with his forms  Cocchiarella adopts the forms to avoid paradox   4 6  Armstrong  The Australian philosopher David Malet Armstrong has been one of the leading realists in the twentieth century  and has used a concept of universals to build a naturalistic and scientifically realist ontology upon  In both Universals and Scientific Realism and Universals  An Opinionated Introduction  Armstrong describes the relative merits of a number of nominalist theories which appeal either to  natural classes   a view he ascribes to Anthony Quinton   concepts  resemblance relations or predicates  and also discusses non realist  trope  accounts  which he describes in the Universals and Scientific Realism volumes as  particularism    He gives a number of reasons to reject all of these  but also dismisses a number of realist accounts   5  See also  Abstract object  Bundle theory  Conceptualism  Nominalism  Object  philosophy   Philosophy of mathematics  Platonic form  Qualia  Realism  philosophy   Universal
