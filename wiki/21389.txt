Telecommunications in Nigeria include radio  television  fixed and mobile telephones  and the Internet   1  Radio and television  Radio stations   network of federal government controlled national  regional  and state radio stations  roughly 40 state government owned radio stations typically carry their own programs except for news broadcasts  about 20 private radio stations  transmissions of

and regional TV stations  all 36 states operate TV stations  several private TV stations operational  cable and satellite TV subscription services are available  2007    Television sets  56 9 million  2007    Nigeria s media scene is one of the most vibrant in Africa  Because newspapers and television are relatively expensive and literacy levels low  radio remains the most important medium of mass communication and information  International broadcasters  including the BBC  are popular  TV viewing is concentrated in urban areas   The largest broadcasting companies are the government owned Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria  FRCN  and the Nigerian Television Authority  NTA   The NTA has two television services  One is NTA 1  which is distributed among NTA s six television zones  The other is NTA 2  which is distributed nationwide and is funded mostly by advertising  NITEL owns a majority of the transmitters that broadcast FRCN and NTA programming   Each state also has a broadcasting company that broadcasts one or two locally operated terrestrial stations  This means that there are about 50 government owned  but partly independent television stations  Private players in the Nigerian television scene include  Silverbird Television  STV   Africa Independent Television  AIT   Channels Television  Superscreen Television  and several others  Most of their programming is aimed for the African and global markets and is broadcast globally from Lagos  Abuja  Obosi and Port Harcourt centers with affiliated TV stations in several African countries  African Independent Television  AIT  is a high profile satellite television station broadcasting globally from its Lagos and Abuja centers  Other direct satellite television stations with international reach operating in Nigeria are Murhi International Television  ON Television  Galaxy TV  TV Continental  etc  all in Lagos   There is general access to cable television like DSTV  a South African cable television station  broadcast over satellite  HiTV  DaarSat  StarTimes and Infinity TV are other examples of cable TV in Nigeria  M Net ceased operations in December 2011  but had offices in most Nigerian cities  and was watched by a large number of people   1 1  Media control and press freedom  The government controls much of the electronic media through the National Broadcasting Commission  NBC   which is responsible for monitoring and regulating broadcast media  Radio stations remain susceptible to political censorship and attacks by political groups  For example  in January 2012 some media figures alleged the NBC warned radio stations not to broadcast stories about fuel subsidy protests   Libel is a civil offense and requires defendants to prove the truth of opinion or value judgment contained in news reports or commentaries  or pay penalties  This limits the circumstances in which media defendants can rely on the defense of  fair comment on matters of public interest  and restricts their right to freedom of expression  Penalties for defamation of character include two years  imprisonment and possible fines   The law requires local television stations to limit programming from other countries to 40 percent and restricts foreign content of satellite broadcasting to 20 percent  The NBC s 2004 prohibition of live broadcasts of foreign news and programs remains in force  but does not apply to international cable or satellite services  The Voice of America is not allowed to broadcast programs through local affiliate stations   Security forces beat  detain  and harass journalists  On numerous occasions security forces and police have arrested and detained journalists who criticized the government  Reporting on matters such as political corruption and security issues are particularly sensitive  Politicians and political parties harass and attack journalists perceived as reporting on them or their interests in a negative manner  During local and state elections  journalists have been intimidated or attacked for covering certain election related events  Journalists have been killed while reporting stories  The militant group Boko Haram threatens media outlets and has killed members of the press  On 20 January 2012  unknown gunmen killed Channels TV reporter Enenche Akogwu while he was reporting on the Boko Haram attacks and bombings in Kano that day  Journalists practice self censorship   2  Telephones  Calling code  +234  International call prefix  009  Connected lines       2 452 697 fixed wired wireless lines  June 2013    164 642 742 mobile

remains a problem  the addition of a second fixed line provider in 2002 resulted in faster growth but subscribership remains only about 1 per 100 persons  mobile cellular services growing rapidly  in part responding to the shortcomings of the fixed line network  multiple cellular providers operate nationally with a subscribership approaching 60 per 100 persons  2010    Satellite earth stations  3

west coast of Africa to each other and on to Portugal  and  WASACE  planned  will link Nigeria to Angola  and South Africa and on to Brazil  the United States  and France  Deregulation of the mobile phone market has led to the introduction of Global System for Mobile Communication  GSM  network providers operating on the 900 1800 MHz spectrum  MTN Nigeria  Airtel  Globacom  and Etisalat  Use of cell phones has soared  and has mostly replaced the unreliable fixed line services of Nigerian Telecommunications Limited  NITEL   An October 2011 estimate placed the number of mobile phones at about 88 million  with most people having more than one cellphone   With the expiration of the exclusivity period of the main GSM network providers  Nigeria s telecom regulator  the Nigerian Communications Commission  NCC   introduced the Unified Licencing Regime  It is hoped that telcos with unified licences will be able to provide fixed and mobile telephony and Internet access as well as any other communications service they choose to offer  In March 2011 the NCC started registering SIM cards  The exercise is expected to last until 28 September 2011   After a decade of failed privatization attempts  the incumbent national telco NITEL and its mobile arm M Tel are currently in liquidation   3  Internet  Top level domain   ng  Internet users   55 9 million users  8th in the world  32 9% of

and operated Internet cafes   A new dimension to Internet connectivity has been introduced with millions of people accessing the Internet on their WAP enabled mobile phones  smartphones and on their PCs using their phones as a modem  This is largely due to the introduction of GPRS  General Packet Radio Service  and EDGE  Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution  connectivity by the GSM operators  All existing GSM networks presently offer GPRS services and have introduced 3G UMTS   3 1  Internet censorship and surveillance  Listed by the OpenNet Initiative as no evidence of Internet filtering in all four areas for which they test  political  social  conflict security  and Internet tools  in October 2009   There are few government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports the government monitors e mail or Internet chat rooms  Although the constitution and law provide for freedom of speech  including for members of the press  the government sometimes restricts these rights in practice  Libel is a civil offense and requires defendants to prove the truth of opinion or value judgment contained in news reports or commentaries  Penalties include two years  imprisonment and possible fines  Militant groups such as Boko Haram threaten  attack  and kill journalists in connection with their reporting of the sect’s activities  Journalists practice self censorship   Reporting on political corruption and security issues has proved to be particularly sensitive  On 24 October 2012 police in Bauchi State arraigned civil servant Abbas Ahmed Faggo before a court for allegedly defaming the character of Governor Isa Yuguda after he posted messages on his Facebook account accusing the governor of spending public funds on his son s wedding  On 4 November  the court discharged Faggo  but media reported the state government fired him later that month   During 2012 several Internet news sites critical of the government experienced server problems  which site owners attributed to government interference  Such disruptions usually lasted a few hours   In 2008 two journalists were arrested for publishing online articles and photos critical of the government   4  See also  Nigerian weather and communications satellites  Media in Nigeria  List of terrestrial fibre optic cable projects in Africa  5  References  6  External links    Landline
