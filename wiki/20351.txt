The Maginot Line       named after the French Minister of War André Maginot  was a line of concrete fortifications  obstacles  and weapons installations that France constructed just before the border with Switzerland and the borders with Germany and Luxembourg during the 1930s  The Line did not extend through to the English Channel because the French military did not want to compromise Belgium s neutrality  The line was a response to France s experience in World War I and was constructed during the run up to World War II  shortly after the Locarno Conference that gave rise to a fanciful and optimistic  Locarno spirit    The French established the fortification to provide time for their army to mobilize in the event of attack  allowing French forces to move into Belgium for a decisive confrontation with Germany  The success of static  defensive combat in World War I was a key influence on French thinking  French military experts extolled the Maginot Line as a work of genius  believing it would prevent any further invasions from the east  However  American commanders viewed the fortification as a throwback to previous wars and thought that France should employ the new defensive tactics that the modern world had already adopted   While the fortification system did prevent a direct attack  it was strategically ineffective  as the Germans invaded through Belgium  going around the Maginot Line  The German army came through the Ardennes forest and the Low Countries  completely sweeping by the line  causing the French army to surrender and conquering France in about six weeks  As such  reference to the Maginot Line is used to recall a strategy or object that people hope will prove effective but instead fails miserably  giving way to the  Maginot Line mentality    The Maginot Line was impervious to most forms of attack  including aerial bombings and tank fire   and had state of the art living conditions for garrisoned troops  air conditioning  comfortable eating areas and underground railways  However  it proved costly to maintain and subsequently led to parts of the French Armed Forces being underfunded and not provided with the troops  equipment and communications needed for the war   1  Planning and construction  The defences were first proposed by Marshal Joffre  He was opposed by modernists such as Paul Reynaud and Charles de Gaulle who favoured investment in armour and aircraft  Joffre had support from Henri Philippe Pétain  and there were a number of reports and commissions organised by the government  It was André Maginot who finally convinced the government to invest in the scheme  Maginot was another veteran of World War I  he became the French Minister of Veteran Affairs and then Minister of War  1928–1932    Part of the rationale for the Maginot Line stemmed from the severe French losses during the First World War  and their effects on French demographics  The drop in the national birth rate during and after the war  resulting from a national shortage of young men created an  echo  effect in the generation that provided the French conscript army in the mid 1930s  Faced with inadequate personnel resources  French planners had to rely more on older and less fit reservists  who would take longer to mobilize  and would diminish French industry because they would leave their jobs  Static defensive positions were therefore intended not only to buy time  but also to defend an area with fewer and less mobile forces  In practice  France deployed about twice as many men  36 divisions  roughly one third of its force   for defence of the Maginot Line in Alsace and Lorraine  whereas the opposing German Army Group C only contained 19 divisions  or less than one seventh of the total force committed in Fall Gelb   The line was built in several phases from 1930 by the STG  Service Technique du Génie  overseen by CORF  Commission d Organisation des Régions Fortifiées   The main construction was largely completed by 1939  at a cost of around 3 billion French francs   The line stretched from Switzerland to Luxembourg  and a much lighter extension was extended to the Strait of Dover after 1934  The original line construction did not cover the area chosen by the Germans for their first challenge  which was through the Ardennes in 1940  a plan known as Fall Gelb  due to the neutrality of Belgium  The location of this attack  because of the Maginot Line  was through the Belgian Ardennes forest  sector 4   which is off the map to the left of Maginot Line sector 6  as marked    2  Purposes  The Maginot Line was built to fulfill several purposes   To avoid a surprise attack and to give the alarm  To cover the mobilisation of the French Army  which took between two and three weeks   To save manpower  France counted inhabitants  Germany    To protect Alsace and Lorraine  returned to France in 1918  and their industrial basin  To be used as a basis for a counter offensive  To push the enemy to circumvent it while passing by Switzerland or Belgium  To hold the enemy while the main army could be brought up to reinforce the line  To show non aggressive posture  and compel the British to help France if Germany invaded Belgium  To push Belgium into the war  by leaving it open to an attack from Germany  3  Organization  Although the name  Maginot Line  suggests a rather thin linear fortification  it was quite deep  varying  i e   from the border to the rear area  from between   It was composed of an intricate system of strong points  fortifications and military facilities such as border guard posts  communications centres  infantry shelters  barricades  artillery  machine gun and anti tank gun emplacements  supply depots  infrastructure facilities and observation posts  These various structures reinforced a principal line of resistance  made up of the most heavily armed ouvrages  which can be roughly translated as fortresses or major defensive works   From front to rear   east to west  the line was composed of   Border Post line  1   This consisted of blockhouses and strong houses  which were often camouflaged as inoffensive residential homes  built within a few metres of the border  and manned by troops so as to give the alarm in the event of a sneak or surprise attack as well as to delay enemy tanks with prepared explosives and barricades   Outpost and Support Point line  2   Approximately behind the border  a line of anti tank blockhouses that were intended to provide resistance to armoured assault sufficient to delay the enemy so as to allow the crews of the  C O R F  ouvrages  to be ready at their battle stations  These outposts covered major passages within the principal line   Principal line of resistance  3   This line began behind the border  It was preceded by anti tank obstacles made of metal rails planted vertically in six rows  with heights varying from and buried to a depth of   These anti tank obstacles extended from end to end in front of the major works across hundreds of kilometres  interrupted only by extremely dense forests  rivers  or other nearly impassable terrain   Infantry Casemates  4   These bunkers were armed with twin machine guns  abbreviated as JM in French  and anti tank guns of   They could be single  with only one firing room in only one direction  or double  two firing rooms  in two opposite directions   These generally had two floors  with a firing level and a support infrastructure level that provided the troops with rest and services  power generating units  reserves of water  fuel  food  ventilation equipment  etc    The infantry casemates often had one or two  cloches  or turrets located on top of them  These GFM cloches were sometimes used to emplace machine guns or observation periscopes  They were manned by 20 to 30 men   Petits ouvrages  5   These small fortresses reinforced the line of infantry bunkers  The petits ouvrages were generally made up of several infantry bunkers connected by an underground tunnel network to which were attached various buried facilities  such as barracks  electric generators  ventilation systems  mess halls  infirmaries and supply caches  Their crew consisted of between 100 and 200 men   Ouvrages  6   These fortresses were the most important fortifications on the Maginot Line  having the sturdiest construction and the heaviest artillery  These were composed of at least six  forward bunker systems  or  combat blocks   as well as two entrances  and were interconnected via a network of underground tunnels that often featured narrow gauge electric railways for transport between bunker systems  The various blocks contained necessary infrastructure such as power stations with generating units  independent ventilating systems  barracks and mess halls  kitchens  water storage and distribution systems  hoists  ammunition stores  workshops  and stores of spare parts and food  Their crews ranged from 500 to more than 1 000 men   Observation Posts  7  were located on hills that provided a good view of the surrounding area  Their purpose was to locate the enemy and direct and correct the indirect fire of artillery from the artillery fortifications as well as to report on the progress and position of key enemy units  These are large reinforced buried concrete bunkers  equipped with armoured turrets containing high precision optics that were connected with the other fortifications by field telephone and wireless transmitters  known in French by the acronym T S F     Telephone Network  8   This system connected every fortification in the Maginot Line  including bunkers  infantry and artillery fortresses  observation posts and shelters  Two telephone wires were placed parallel to the line of fortifications  providing redundancy in the event of a wire getting cut  There were places along the cable where dismounted soldiers could connect to the network   Infantry Reserve Shelters  9   These were found between behind the principal line of resistance  These were buried concrete bunkers designed to house and shelter up to a company of infantry  200 to 250 men   and had such features as electric generators  ventilation systems  water supplies  kitchens and heating  which allowed their occupants to hold out in the event of an attack  They could also be used as a local headquarters and as a base for counter attacks   Flood Zones  10  were natural basins or rivers that could be flooded on demand and thus constitute an additional obstacle in the event of an enemy offensive   Safety Quarters  11  were built near the major fortifications so fortress   ouvrage   crews could reach their battle stations in the shortest possible time in the event of a surprise or sneak attack during peacetime   Supply depots  12    Ammunition dumps  13    Narrow Gauge Railway System  14   A network of narrow gauge railways was built so as to rearm and resupply the major fortresses   ouvrages   from supply depots up to away  Petrol engined armoured locomotives pulled supply trains along these narrow gauge lines   A similar system was developed with armoured steam engines back in 1914–1918    High voltage Transmission Lines  15   initially above ground but then buried  and connected to the civil power grid  provided electric power to the many fortifications and fortresses   Heavy rail artillery  16  was hauled in by locomotives to predesignated locations so as to support the pre emplaced artillery located in the fortresses  which was intentionally limited in range to    4  Inventory  4 1  Ouvrages  There are 142 ouvrages  352 casemates  78 shelters  17 observatories and around blockhouses in the Maginot Line   4 2  Armoured cloches  There are several kinds of armoured cloches  The word cloche is a French term meaning bell due to its shape  All cloches were made in an alloy steel  Cloches are non retractable turrets   The most widespread are the GFM cloches  where GFM means Guetteur fusil mitrailleur  machine gun sentry   They are composed of three to four openings  called crenels or embrasures  These crenels may be equipped as follows  Rifle machine gun  direct vision block  binoculars block or mortar  Sometimes  the cloche is topped by a periscope  There are GFM cloches on the line  Almost every block  casemate and shelter is topped by one or two GFM cloches   The JM cloches are the same as the GFM cloches except that they have one opening equipped with a pair of machine guns  There are 174 JM cloches on the line   There are 72 AM cloches  armes mixtes or  mixed weapons   on the line  equipped with a pair of machine guns and a anti tank gun  Some GFM cloches were transformed into AM cloches in 1934   The aforementioned total does not include these modified cloches    There are 75 LG cloches  lance grenade – grenade launcher  on the line  Those cloches are almost completely covered by concrete  with only a small hole to launch grenades through for local defence   There are 20 VP cloches  periscopic vision  on the line  These cloches could be equipped with several different periscopes  Like the LG cloches  they were almost completely covered by concrete   The VDP cloches  direct and periscopic vision  are similar to the VP cloches  but have two or three openings to provide a direct view  Consequently  they were not covered by concrete  Image cloche gfm jpg GFM cloche Image cloche jm jpg JM cloche Image cloche am jpg AM cloche Image cloche lg jpg LG cloche Image cloche vp jpg VP cloche Image cloche vdp jpg

specification of the defences was very high  with extensive and interconnected bunker complexes for thousands of men  there were 45 main forts  grands ouvrages  at intervals of   97 smaller forts  petits ouvrages  and 352 casemates between  with over of tunnels  Artillery was coordinated with protective measures to ensure that one fort could support the next in line by bombarding it directly without harm  The largest guns were therefore fortress guns  larger weapons were to be part of the mobile forces and were to be deployed behind the lines   The fortifications did not extend through the Ardennes Forest  which was believed to be impenetrable by Commander in Chief Maurice Gamelin  or along France s border with Belgium  because the two countries had signed an alliance in 1920  by which the French army would operate in Belgium if the German forces invaded  However  after France had failed to counter Germany s remilitarisation of the Rhineland  Belgium—thinking that France was not a reliable ally—abrogated the treaty in 1936 and declared neutrality  France quickly extended the Maginot Line along the Franco Belgian border  but not to the standard of the rest of the line  As the water table in this region is high  there was the danger of underground passages getting flooded  which the designers of the line knew would be difficult and expensive to overcome   When the British Expeditionary Force landed in France in September 1939  they and the French reinforced and extended the Maginot line to the sea in a flurry of construction in 1939–1940 accompanied by general improvements all along the line  The final line was strongest around the industrial regions of Metz  Lauter and Alsace  while other areas were in comparison only weakly guarded  In contrast  the propaganda about the line made it appear far greater a construction than it was  illustrations showed multiple stories of interwoven passages  and even underground railyards and cinemas  This reassured Allied civilians   5 1  Czech connection  Czechoslovakia was also in fear of Hitler and began building its own defences  As an ally of France  they were able to get advice on the Maginot design and apply it to Czechoslovak border fortifications  The design of the casemates is similar to the ones found in the southern part of the Maginot Line  and photos of such are often confused with those of the Maginot  Following the Munich Agreement and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia  the Germans were able to use the Czech fortifications to study and plan attacks that proved very successful against the western fortifications   the Belgian Fort Eben Emael is the best known example    6  German invasion in World War II  The World War II German invasion plan of 1940  Sichelschnitt  was designed to deal with the line  A decoy force sat opposite the line while a second Army Group cut through the Low Countries of Belgium and the Netherlands  as well as through the Ardennes Forest  which lay north of the main French defences  Thus the Germans were able to avoid a direct assault on the Maginot Line by violating the neutrality of Belgium  Luxembourg and the Netherlands  Attacking on 10 May  German forces were well into France within five days and they continued to advance until 24 May  when they stopped near Dunkirk   During the advance to the English Channel  the Germans overran France s border defence with Belgium and several Maginot Forts in the Maubeuge area  whilst the Luftwaffe simply flew over it  On 19 May  the German 16th Army successfully captured the isolated petit ouvrage La Ferte  southeast of Sedan  after conducting a deliberate assault by combat engineers backed up by heavy artillery  The entire French crew of 107 soldiers was killed during the action  On 14 June 1940  the day Paris fell  the German 1st Army went over to the offensive in  Operation Tiger  and attacked the Maginot Line between St  Avold and Saarbrücken  The Germans then broke through the fortification line as defending French forces retreated southward  In the following days  infantry divisions of the 1st Army attacked fortifications on each side of the penetration  successfully capturing four petits ouvrages  The 1st Army also conducted two attacks against the Maginot Line further to the east in northern Alsace  One attack successfully broke through a weak section of the line in the Vosges Mountains  but a second attack was stopped by the French defenders near Wissembourg  On 15 June  infantry divisions of the German 7th Army attacked across the Rhine River in Operation  Small Bear   penetrating the defences and capturing the cities of Colmar and Strasbourg   By early June the German forces had cut off the line from the rest of France and the French government was making overtures for an armistice  which was signed on 22 June in Compiègne  As the line was surrounded  the German Army attacked a few ouvrages from the rear  but were unsuccessful in capturing any significant fortifications  The main fortifications of the line were still mostly intact  a number of commanders were prepared to hold out  and the Italian advance had been successfully contained  Nevertheless  Maxime Weygand signed the surrender instrument and the army was ordered out of their fortifications  to be taken to POW camps   When the Allied forces invaded in June 1944  the line  now held by German defenders  was again largely bypassed  fighting touched only portions of the fortifications near Metz and in northern Alsace towards the end of 1944  During the German offensive  Operation Nordwind  in January 1945  Maginot Line casemates and fortifications were utilized by Allied forces  especially in the region of Hatten Rittershoffen  and some German units had been supplemented with flamethrower tanks in anticipation of this possibility  At one point during the fighting  General Martin  commander of the IX Corps  was ordered to advance from the Maginot Line against a German division  and consequently locked the concrete bunkers and left the keys with a colleague  When his fellow commander s unit was ordered south to reinforce French cities  Martin was forced to retreat from his attack and found himself pursued by a German tank division  and locked out of his own fortifications  He had to employ French engineers and sappers to break into the bunkers  which were subsequently overrun by the Germans   7  After World War II  After the war the line was re manned by the French and underwent some modifications  With the rise of the French independent nuclear weapons by 1960 the line became an expensive anachronism  Some of the larger ouvrages were converted to command centres  When France withdrew from NATO s military component  in 1966  much of the line was abandoned  with the NATO facilities turned back over to French forces and the rest of it auctioned off to the public or left to decay  A number of old fortifications have now been turned into wine cellars  a mushroom farm and even a disco  Besides that  a few private houses are built atop some of the blockhouses   Ouvrage Rochonvillers was retained by the French Army as a command centre into the 1990s  but has recently been closed  Ouvrage Hochwald is the only facility in the main line that remains in active service  as a hardened command facility for the French Air Force known as Drachenbronn Air Base   In 1968 when scouting locations for On Her Majesty s Secret Service  producer Harry Saltzman used his French contacts to gain permission to use portions of the Maginot Line as SPECTRE headquarters in the film  Saltzman provided art director Syd Cain with a tour of the complex  but Cain said that not only would the location be difficult to light and film inside  but that artificial sets could be constructed at the studios for a fraction of the cost  The idea was shelved   8  See also  Atlantic Wall  Czechoslovak border
