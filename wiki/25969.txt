The Roland TB 303 Bass Line is a bass synthesizer with built in sequencer manufactured by the Roland Corporation from 1982 to 1984 that had a defining role in the development of contemporary electronic dance music   1  History  The TB 303  short for  Transistor Bass   was originally marketed to guitarists for bass accompaniment while practicing alone  Production lasted approximately 18 months  resulting in only 10 000 units  It was not until the mid  to late 1980s that DJs and electronic musicians in Chicago found a use for the machine in the context of the newly developing house music genre   2  Features  The TB 303 has a single audio oscillator  which may be configured to produce either a sawtooth wave or a square wave  The square wave is derived from the sawtooth waveform using a simple  single transistor waveshaping circuit  This produces a sound that is subtly different from the square waveform created by the dedicated hardware found in most analog synthesizers  It also includes a simple envelope generator  with a decay control only  A lowpass filter is also included  with  24dB per octave attenuation  and controls for cutoff frequency  resonance  and envelope modulation parameters  It is a common misconception that the filter is a 3 pole 18dB per octave design when in fact it is 4 pole 24dB per octave   The TB 303 sequencer has some unique features that contribute to its characteristic sound  During the programming of a sequence  the user can determine whether a note should be accented  and whether it should employ portamento  a smooth transition to the following note  The portamento circuitry employs a fixed slide time  meaning that whatever the interval between notes  the time taken to reach the correct pitch is always the same  The accent circuitry  as well as increasing the amplitude of a note  also emphasizes the EG filter s cutoff and resonance  resulting in a distinctive  hollow  wow  sound at higher resonance settings  Roland referred to this as  gimmick  circuitry   The instrument also features a  simple  step time method for entering note data into the 16 step programmable sequencer  This was notoriously difficult to use  and would often result in entering a different sequence than the one that had been intended  Some users also take advantage of a low voltage failure mode  wherein patterns that are programmed in memory get completely scrambled if the batteries are removed for a time   3  Usage   Rip It Up  by Scottish post punk band Orange Juice  which reached #8 in the UK singles chart in February 1983  was the first UK hit to feature the synthesiser  This was pre dated by Charanjit Singh s Synthesizing  Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat  an album of original electronic disco compositions recorded using the TB 303 and TR 808 in 1982   In the late 1980s and early 1990s  as new Acid styles emerged  the TB 303 was often overdriven  producing a harsher liquid acid like sound  Examples of this technique include Phuture s 1987  Acid Tracks   sometimes known as  Acid Trax  which started Acid House   Hardfloor s 1992 EP  Acperience  and Interlect 3000 s 1993 EP  Volcano   Jesse Saunders also utilized the TB 303 with a Roland TR 808 drum machine and Korg Poly 61 synthesizer for the seminal Chicago house record  On and On   1984    In other instances the TB 303 was extremely distorted and processed  such as Josh Wink s 1995 hit  Higher State of Consciousness    The well known  acid  sound is typically produced by playing a repeating note pattern on the TB 303  while altering the filter s cutoff frequency  resonance  and envelope modulation  The TB 303 s accent control modifies a note s volume  filter resonance  and envelope modulation  allowing further variations in timbre  A distortion effect  either by using a guitar effects pedal or overdriving the input of an audio mixer  is commonly used to give the TB 303 a denser  noisier timbreâ€”as the resulting sound is much richer in harmonics  Popular pedals include pedals by Boss and DOD Electronics pedals like the Grunge or Death Metal   The head designer of the TB 303  Tadao Kikumoto  was also responsible for leading design of the TR 909 drum machine  In 2011  The Guardian listed the 1981 release of the TB 303 as one of the 50 key events in the history of dance music   4  Software  By 1997  software synthesizers were beginning to take hold among electronic musicians  One notable package was made by Propellerhead Software s emulator package entitled ReBirth  The software became very popular  providing a cheap and easy way for musicians to reproduce the classic TB 303  808  and later 909 sounds  without the need for any synthesis hardware  Roland contacted Propellerhead to give the company an unofficial  thumbs up  which Propellerhead considered as the Roland  Seal of Approval   As of September 2005  support for ReBirth has been discontinued by Propellerhead software  and the software is now available online as a free download  In 2010 a new paid version was released for the Apple iPhone and iPad  making use of those devices  multi touch capabilities  Other notable softsynth versions include the TS 404 synthesizer found bundled with FL Studio  and The  Bass Line  plugin from AudioRealism  It supports both the VST and AU standards  Native Instrument s flagship softsynth Massive  as well as many other softsynths  contain filters modelled after that of the TB 303  allowing users to create their own realistic sounding acid patches   5  Clones  The original TB 303 became a staple for world traveling DJs  Its compact size and tone suited both air travel and the DJ booth  The wear and tear of 200 gigs a year and travel caused some to commission custom CNC cases cut from aluminum  Electronic modifications included expanded memory  the use of lithium batteries to reduce weight and increase reliability  tonal modifications to increase envelope length  add distortion  and increase the lower bass range of filters  Heavy use in dusty and liquid hazard environments led to replacement of worn thirty year old switches with new sealed switches for higher reliability  The electronic music equivalent of a skilled luthier supplied these expensive modifications to a willing clientele in units called the  Devilfish   The Borg  and  Acidlab   These customized TB 303s changed hands in some cases at over $3 000  The price of increasingly worn out TB 303 rose steadily with demand  High prices were paid for ones with cracked cases  or circuit boards damaged by the acid corrosion eating traces and wires  caused by old batteries left in stored units   By the middle of the 1990s  demand for the TB 303 surged within the electronic dance music scene  As there were never many TB 303s to begin with  many small synthesizer companies cropped up and started to develop their own TB 303 hardware clones  Many were rack designs  aimed at studios  not travelling DJs  This new wave of TB 303 clones began with a company called Novation Electronic Music Systems  who released their portable Bass Station keyboard in 1994  Many other TB 303  clones  followed  including Future Retro s 777  Syntecno s TeeBee  Doepfer s MS 404  MAM MB33  Freebass FB 383  Future Retro s Revolution  Acidlab Bassline  Acidcode ML 303  Oakley TM3030  Analogue Solutions Trans Bass Xpress and Will Systems MAB 303   As the popularity of these new TB 303 clones grew  Roland  the original TB 303 manufacturer  finally took notice and released their own TB 303  clone  in 1996  the MC 303 Groovebox  Despite Roland s efforts  their new  303 clone  was an entirely new product that had almost nothing to do with the original TB 303  with the exception of a few bass samples and the familiar interface design  The most obvious difference was the inclusion of an inexpensive digital synthesizer  rather than the analog circuitry of the TB 303   The Roland MC 202 MicroComposer is a monophonic analog synthesizer sequencer released by Roland in 1983  Whilst not strictly a clone of the TB 303  it is closely associated  It is also similar to the SH 101 synthesizer  featuring one voltage controlled oscillator with simultaneous saw and square pulse width waveforms and a resonant  24db filter   Influenced by pioneer TB 303 modifier Robin Whittle  Limor Fried  an MIT engineering graduate and a group of friends with a high level of skill in electronics and software began to study the TB 303  Taking Fatboy Slim s  Everybody Needs A 303  to heart by 2004 the group at ladyada net began to produce a DIY kit that was very very close to the original sound and drew upon modern parts and a handful of hard to find parts  It is a deliberately open source do it yourself hardware solution called the x0xb0x  using most of the original components in the synthesizer section for a very authentic sound  The sequencer section differs from the original TB 303  adding support for MIDI and USB interfaces as well as an alternate event entry interface with different operating systems  such as SOKKos  also open sourced and community written   Modifications of the original x0xb0x design inspired a number of designers who went on to careers making software and instruments and helped raise the profile of electrical engineering and home based circuit design and pcb production generally among young talented individuals who were attracted to the idea of performing with instruments they had personally built  Community forums provided a nurturing environment online for those who wanted to make their own TB 303  For under $500 an individual now had access to a superior machine at the quarter of the price of a used TB 303 and the knowledge they gained in building it   Emerging from the DIY kit movement was a masterpiece that far surpassed any previous TB 303 clone  The extensive input and output and internal distortion modifications by a California engineer named Brian Castro led him to design secondary and replacement pcb kits  His work which drew an unheard off award to an individual from an English electronic music magazine  certainly drew upon his time as a member in good standing in the xobox forums  His decisive timbral choices  smooth integration and engineering skill resulted in a spectacular instrument  The x0xi0 adds a second tuneable oscillator  a noise source  a second ADSR  an AR for accent  FM and cross modulation momentary switches  extended range audio and extreme envelope ranges sophisticated routing  distortion and overdrive  It locked together three types of synthesizers communication signals  modular cv & gate voltages  DIN sync timing clocks for TR 909 and TR 808 drum machines  and MIDI   In the fall of 2012 a Hong Kong based TB 303 clone appeared  Cyclone Analogic TT 303 Bass Bot uses surface mount technology to match the original circuitry s sound  with flash memory and MIDI  Flash memory requires no battery  the cause of much corrosion to older TB 303s  It would be difficult to tell this machine from an original in a blindfold test  Unlike previous clones it looks and feels remarkably like an original TB 303   Devilfish  designer Robin Whittle is exploring modifications for it  However the Bass Bot TT 303 uses a non standard midi port that requires a proprietary Y cord and uses just one jack for midi in and out  It does not support DIN sync  The TT 303 includes the  InstaDJ  firmware which allows for the creation of random pattern generated using seven different  personalities    In 2013  Korg released the  Volca  series of synthesizers  including the Volca Bass  which takes some style cues from the 303  and is touted as having a 303 sound   In 2014 Roland released the  Aira  seires including the TB 3 Touch Bassline synthesizer  The TB 3 is a digital re imagination of the 303 more so than a replication  Original Square and Saw tooth sounds are featured  plus additional presets and modern features   6  Popular media  The TB 303 is the subject of Fatboy Slim s first single   Everybody Needs a 303    The TB 303 is the subject of one of Showtek s songs  titled  My 303    The TB 303 and TR 909 were used in Public Energy s track  Three O  Three  on Holland s Stealth Records label in 1992  #STR 3492    The TB 303 is referenced by Dub FX and Sirius in their song   Slope of the famous TB 303  off the album  A Crossworlds    The TB 303  Along with many of the TB models such as the TB 909 and Etc   has been referenced in the highly renowned anime series  Eureka Seven Psalms of Planets  as the names of the  Mecha  for the main characters  These drum machines were used generously in the making of the Eureka Seven Psalms of Planets ODST in 2005 06   7  References  8  External links  TB 303 Resource Index
