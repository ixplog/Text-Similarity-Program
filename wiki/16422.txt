of Myrtle Marguerite  McKee  and William Andrew Anderson  Her mother s ancestors were Scottish and Irish  her father s was from a Norwegian family  with some Sami ancestors   Her mother was a teacher  Her father was a Royal Canadian Air Force flight lieutenant who instructed new pilots at Fort Macleod  where the Allied forces were gathering to learn to fly  During the war years  she moved with her parents to a number of bases in Western Canada  After the war  her father began working as a grocer  and his work took the family to Saskatchewan  to the towns of Maidstone and North Battleford  She later sang about her small town upbringing in  Song for Sharon    In Maidstone  a  two block  one church  one hotel town   Joni s family lived without indoor plumbing and running water  Many of the other residents were First Nations people  Canadians of European origin such as Joni s grandfather had only begun to settle there in recent decades  The town was along the old railway  and the line ran right behind her bedroom  She used to  sit up in bed each morning to watch the one train that always passed daily   Joni said   The weird thing is that years later my parents met the conductor of that train at a party  He said   All I remember of your town is a house with Christmas decorations and a kid that used to wave at me    Joni loved spending time outdoors  She also said   My mother raised me on words    Where other parents would quote from the Bible  she would quote from Shakespeare  She was a romantic woman  She encouraged me in all those old fashioned things  I kept pressed flower scrap books    Joni s father was an amateur musician who loved swing records and played trumpet in marching bands  and Joni would join in town parades with her father s band and other children  Many of her childhood friends were taking music lessons  and she would tag along to their performances  where she developed her first musical obsessions  Debussy  Ravel  Stravinsky  Chopin and Beethoven  Much later  the first LP she saved up to buy was Rachmaninov s Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini  Mitchell briefly studied classical piano between the ages of 6 and 7  She said   I wanted to play    I wanted to do what I do now  which is to lay my hand on it and to memorize what comes off of it and to create with it  But my music teacher told me I played by ear which was a sin  you know  and that I would never be able to read these pieces because I memorized things    I didn t fall into the norm for that system  so I dropped that    At the age of 8  Joni contracted polio during a 1951 epidemic in Canada  the same one in which singer Neil Young  then aged 5 and living in Ontario  also contracted the virus  It was the last major epidemic in North America before Jonas Salk s polio vaccine was successfully tested  Bedridden for weeks in hospital  Joni became aware that she would have to move across the hall and live in an iron lung for the remainder of her life if her condition worsened  As she later described  it was during her time in the hospital that winter that she first became interested in singing  She told the story later   They said I might not walk again  and that I would not be able to go home for Christmas  I wouldn t go for it  So I started to sing Christmas carols and I used to sing them real loud    The boy in the bed next to me  you know  used to complain  And I discovered I was a ham  Before contracting polio  Mitchell had been interested in the arts  but she had been more athletic than artistic  Once she recovered  she realized she would no longer be able to compete with the fastest swimmers or runners  and to compensate she became interested in dancing  At the age of 9 she began smoking  which has been a lifelong habit  Mitchell s smoking has been the subject of criticism from journalists  who have blamed it for changes in her voice as she has aged  but Mitchell has denied the connection  expressing no regret for what she calls  my terrible habits    When Mitchell was 11 years old  her family settled in the city of Saskatoon  Saskatchewan  which she considers her hometown  Mitchell had always been inspired by the beauty of the Canadian Prairies  but she had developed into  a bad student  frustrated by the educational outlook in the provincial towns where she grew up  and school in Saskatoon did not inspire her either  Mitchell s initially dedicated note taking in class would be replaced by a mess of drawings in her notebooks by year s end  and her report cards would say   Joan does not relate well   She said   The way I saw the educational system from an early age was that it taught you what to think  not how to think  There was no liberty  really  for free thinking  You were being trained to fit into a society where free thinking was a nuisance  I liked some of my teachers very much  but I had no interest in their subjects  So I would appease them—I think they perceived that I was not a dummy  although my report card didn t look like it  I would line the math room with ink drawings and portraits of the mathematicians  I did a tree of life for my biology teacher  I was always staying late at the school  down on my knees painting something    Mitchell was drawn to art  but  growing up just at the time before arts were included as a part of education    at that time I was kind of a freak   In grade 7  she had  one radical teacher    a reverer of spirit    He criticized my habit of copying pictures  No one else did  They praised me as a prodigy for my technique   You like to paint   he asked  I nodded   If you can paint with a brush you can paint with words   He drew out my poetry  He was a great disciplinarian in his own punk style  We loved him    I wrote an epic poem in class – I labored to impress him  I got it back circled in red with  cliché  cliché    White as newly fallen snow  –  cliché    high upon a silver shadowed hill  –  cliché   At the bottom he said   Write about what you know  it s more interesting    Mitchell talked about  going out after the rain and gathering tadpoles in an empty mayonnaise jar   and he suggested she put her experience in writing  Mitchell s debut album included a dedication to that teacher   Mr  Kratzman  who taught me to love words    Mitchell wrote poetry as well  She said   I was good in composition  but I wasn t good in the dissection of English    I wasn t scholastically good in it because I didn t like to break it down and analyze it in that manner  and I liked to speak in slang   Mitchell said   I finally flunked out in the twelfth grade  I went back later and picked up the subjects that I lost   She said   My identity  since it wasn t through the grade system  was that I was a good dancer and an artist    I made a lot of my own clothes  I worked in ladies  wear and I modeled  I had access to sample clothes that were too fashionable for our community    I would go hang out on the streets dressed to the T    I hung out downtown with the Ukrainians and the Indians    When I went back to my own neighborhood  I found that I had a provocative image  They thought I was loose because I always liked rowdies    But there also came a stage when my friends who were juvenile delinquents suddenly became criminals  They could go into very dull jobs or they could go into crime  Crime is very romantic in your youth  I suddenly thought   Here s where the romance ends  I don t see myself in jail       Mitchell loved rock and roll  She said   When I was in my teens  rock  n  roll was only on the radio from 4 o clock to 5 o clock  after school  and two hours on Saturdays  If you didn t have a record player and you just HAD to hear those sounds  you went where there was a jukebox    I hung around two cafés that had jukeboxes  The AM Café was close to my house  and the CM Café was on the other side of town and I was forbidden to go there  They were owned by two Chinese guys  Artie Mack and Charlie Mack  You could loiter in the booths  and you could smoke there   As a teenager in the late 1950s  she said   I loved to dance  That was my thing  I instigated a Wednesday night dance  cause I could hardly make it to the weekends  For dancing  I loved Chuck Berry  Ray Charles   What I d Say   I liked Elvis Presley  I liked the Everly Brothers  But then this thing happened  Rock & roll went through a really dumb vanilla period  And during that period  folk music came in to fill the hole  At that point I had friends who d have parties and sit around and sing Kingston Trio songs  That s when I started to sing again  That s why I bought an instrument  To sing at those parties    Mitchell bought herself a ukulele in 1957  She had wanted a guitar  but her mother  with rural roots herself  strongly opposed the idea because of the  hillbilly  image that she connected with the guitar  Before rock  n  roll  the guitar in rural Canada had been mainly used in country and western music and was still widely associated with that genre  Mitchell eventually obtained a guitar  but she continued to play baritone ukulele well into the early 1960s  She initially taught herself how to play guitar out of a Pete Seeger songbook  but she never finished the book  Joni s left hand had been weakened by polio  and some fingerings were difficult or impossible for her to execute  As she added new folk songs to her repertoire  she began to devise dozens of alternative tunings that allowed her to play each song  Later this improvised approach would be  a tool to break free of standard approaches to harmony and structure  in her own songwriting   Joni started singing with her friends at bonfires in the  northern lakes  up around Waskesiu Lake  in the early 1960s  Eventually she got a few gigs in coffeehouses in Saskatoon  Joni s first paid performance was on October 31  1962  at a local club that featured folk and jazz performers  She was 18  and her record collection at the time ran from American folk revivalists whose LPs were helping to expand her repertoire of traditional songs  to her more personal favorites like Edith Piaf and Miles Davis  Joni and her friends were interested in jazz  Though she never performed jazz herself in those days  she and her friends sought out gigs by jazz musicians  Mitchell said   My jazz background began with one of the early Lambert  Hendricks and Ross albums   That album  The Hottest New Group in Jazz  was hard to find in Canada  she says   So I saved up and bought it at a bootleg price  I considered that album to be my Beatles  I learned every song off of it  and I don t think there is another album anywhere – including my own – on which I know every note and word of every song    Joni finished up high school at Aden Bowman Collegiate in Saskatoon  and as a gifted art student took art classes at the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate with Henry Bonli  1927–2011   an abstract expressionist painter  She played music as a way to make some extra money  but she never intended to make a career of it  She wanted to paint  and she left home to attend the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary  At art school  Joni Anderson excelled academically for the first time in her life  However  she struggled with the sense that she was a poorer artist than her grades indicated  She said   I found that I was an honor student at art school for the same reason that I was a bad student – an equal and opposite reason – because I had developed a lot of technical ability    I found that I seemed to be marked for my technical ability so that in free classes where I was really uninspired  my marks remained the same standard  Whereas people who were great in free class  who were original and loose who didn t have the chops in a technical class  would receive a mark that was pretty similar to their technical ability  So I became pretty disillusioned    Mitchell was also coming to realize that her art was out of step with trends at the time  a movement to nearly total abstraction  Influenced by post impressionists Van Gogh and Gauguin and by Picasso s work  she was still interested in painting landscapes and people  representing real things she saw  Figurative artists like herself were being directed to advertising and commercial art  which didn t at all appeal to her  At art school  to support herself  Joni kept gigging as a folk musician on weekends  playing at her college and at a local hotel  After a year  at age 19  she dropped out of school and kept playing  Mitchell took a $15 a week job in a Calgary coffeehouse   singing long tragic songs in a minor key   She played at The Depression  for three months in the autumn of 1963  She also sang at hootenannies and even made appearances on some local TV and radio shows in Calgary   Mitchell s parents valued education very highly  having been raised during the Great Depression  and her decision to abandon her art studies was unpopular with her family  causing friction when she returned home to see them in Saskatchewan  In the summer of 1964 at the age of 20  she told her mother that she intended to be a folk singer in Toronto  and she left Western Canada for the first time in her life  heading east for Ontario  On the three day train ride there  Joni wrote her first song  called  Day After Day   She also stopped at the Mariposa Folk Festival to see Buffy Sainte Marie  a Saskatchewan born Cree folk singer who had inspired her  A year later  Joni too would play Mariposa  her first gig for a major audience  and years later  Sainte Marie herself would cover her   2  Career  2 1  1964–1969  Folk breakthrough  2 1 1  Ontario  Lacking the $200 needed for musicians  union fees  Joni managed a few gigs at The Half Beat and The Village Corner in Toronto s Yorkville neighbourhood  but mostly played non union gigs  in church basements and YMCA meeting halls   Rejected from major folk clubs  she resorted to busking  while she  worked in the women s wear section of a downtown department store to pay the rent   Without a lot of name recognition  Joni also began to realize each city s folk scene tended to accord veteran performers the exclusive right to play their signature songs—despite not having written the songs—which Mitchell found insular  contrary to the egalitarian ideal of folk music  She found her best traditional material was already other singers  property and would no longer pass muster  She said   You d come into a town and you d be told  you can t sing that  you can t sing that   She resolved to write her own originals   In the autumn of 1964  Joni discovered that she was pregnant by her Calgary ex boyfriend Brad MacMath  She later wrote    he  left me three months pregnant in an attic room with no money and winter coming on and only a fireplace for heat  The spindles of the banister were gap toothed fuel for last winter s occupants   At the time   the pill  was legally unavailable in Canada  as was abortion  yet there was a strong social stigma against women giving birth out of wedlock  In Toronto  she could at least do so quietly  without alarming her relatives back home  In February 1965 she gave birth to a baby girl  Unable to provide for the baby  she gave her daughter  Kelly Dale Anderson  up for adoption  The experience remained private for most of her career  but she made allusions to it in several songs  most notably in  Little Green   which she performed in the 1960s but eventually recorded for the 1971 album Blue  At the time  the veiled lyrics were not widely understood – a review described them as impenetrable   In  Chinese Cafe   from the 1982 album Wild Things Run Fast  Mitchell sang   Your kids are coming up straight   My child s a stranger   I bore her   But I could not raise her   These lyrics did not receive wide attention at the time  The existence of Mitchell s daughter was not publicly known until 1993  when a room mate from Mitchell s art school days in the 1960s sold the story of the adoption to a tabloid magazine  By that time  Mitchell s daughter  renamed Kilauren Gibb  had already begun a search for her biological parents  Mitchell and her daughter met in 1997  After the reunion  Mitchell said that she lost interest in songwriting  and she would later identify her daughter s birth and her inability to take care of her as the moment when her songwriting inspiration had really begun  When she could not express herself to the person she wanted to talk to  she became attuned to the whole world and she began to write personally   A few weeks after the birth of her daughter in 1965  Joni Anderson was gigging again around Yorkville  beginning to sing more of her original material for the first time  written with her unique open tunings  In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing  a folk club in Toronto  There she met Chuck Mitchell  an American folk singer from Michigan  Chuck was immediately attracted to Joni and impressed by her performance  and he told her that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States  In one interview  Joni married Chuck only 36 hours after they met  but it is unclear if they were ever married in Toronto  Sometime in late April  Joni left Canada for the first time in her life  going with Chuck to the US  where the two began playing music together  Joni  21 years old  married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname  Joni Mitchell said   We had no money  I made my wedding dress    I walked down the aisle brandishing my daisies    2 1 2  Michigan  While living at the Verona apartments in Detroit s Cass Corridor  Chuck and Joni were regular performers at area coffee houses including The Alcove bar near Wayne State University  the  Rathskeller  a restaurant on the campus of the University of Detroit and the Raven Gallery in Southfield  She began playing and composing songs in alternative guitar tunings taught to her by a fellow musician  Eric Andersen  in Detroit  Oscar Brand featured her several times on his CBC television program Let s Sing Out in 1965 and 1966  broadening her exposure  The marriage and partnership of Joni and Chuck Mitchell dissolved in early 1967  and Joni moved to New York City to pursue her musical dreams as a solo artist  She played venues up and down the East Coast  including Philadelphia  Boston  and Fort Bragg  North Carolina  She performed frequently in coffeehouses and folk clubs and  by this time creating her own material  became well known for her unique songwriting and her innovative guitar style   2 1 3  New York  Folk singer Tom Rush had met Mitchell in Toronto and was impressed with her songwriting ability  He took  Urge For Going  to popular folk act Judy Collins but she was not interested in the song at the time  so Rush recorded it himself  Country singer George Hamilton IV heard Rush performing it and recorded a hit country version  Other artists who recorded Mitchell songs in the early years were Buffy Sainte Marie   The Circle Game    Dave Van Ronk   Both Sides Now    and eventually Judy Collins   Both Sides Now   a top ten hit  and  Michael From Mountains   both included on her 1967 album Wildflowers   Collins also covered  Chelsea Morning   a recording which again eclipsed Mitchell s own commercial success early on   2 1 4  California  While she was playing one night in  The Gaslight South   a club in Coconut Grove  Florida  David Crosby walked in and was immediately struck by her ability and her appeal as an artist  He took her back to Los Angeles  where he set about introducing her and her music to his friends  Soon she was being managed by Elliot Roberts who had a close business association with David Geffen  Roberts and Geffen were to have important influences on her career  Meanwhile  Crosby convinced a record company to let Mitchell record a solo acoustic album without all the folk rock overdubs in vogue at the time  and his clout earned him a producer s credit in March 1968  when Reprise Records released her debut album  alternatively known as Joni Mitchell or Song to a Seagull   Mitchell continued touring steadily to promote the LP  The tour helped create eager anticipation for Mitchell s second LP  Clouds  which was released in April 1969  This album contained Mitchell s own versions of some of her songs already recorded and performed by other artists   Chelsea Morning    Both Sides  Now   and  Tin Angel   The covers of both LPs  including a self portrait on Clouds  were designed and painted by Mitchell  a marriage of her art and music which she would continue throughout her career   2 2  1970–1974  Mainstream success  In March 1970 Clouds won Joni Mitchell her first Grammy Award for Best Folk Performance  The following month  Reprise released her third album  Ladies of the Canyon  Mitchell s sound was already beginning to expand beyond the confines of acoustic folk music and toward pop and rock  with more overdubs  percussion  and backing vocals  and for the first time  many songs composed on piano  which would become a hallmark of Mitchell s style in her most popular era  Her own version of  Woodstock   slower than the Crosby  Stills  Nash & Young cover  was performed solo on a Wurlitzer electric piano  The album also included the already familiar song  The Circle Game  and the environmental anthem  Big Yellow Taxi   with its now famous line   they paved paradise and put up a parking lot    Ladies of the Canyon was an instant smash on FM radio and sold briskly through the summer and fall  eventually becoming Mitchell s first gold album  selling over a half million copies   Mitchell made a decision to stop touring for a year and just write and paint  yet she was still voted  Top Female Performer  for 1970 by Melody Maker  the UK s leading pop music magazine  On the April 1971 release of James Taylor s Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon album  Joni Mitchell is credited with backup vocals – along with Carole King – on the track  You ve Got A Friend   The songs she wrote during the months she took off for travel and life experience would appear on her next album  Blue  released in June 1971  Of Blue and in comparing Joni Mitchell s talent to his own  David Crosby said   By the time she did Blue she was past me and rushing toward the horizon   A 65th Birthday Tribute to Joni Mitchell  2008    Blue was an almost instant critical and commercial success  peaking in the top 20 in the Billboard Album Charts in September and also hitting the British Top 3  Lushly produced  Carey  was the single at the time  but musically  other parts of Blue departed further from the sounds of Ladies of the Canyon in favor of simpler  rhythmic acoustic parts allowing a focus on Mitchell s voice and emotions   All I Want    A Case of You    while others such as  Blue    River  and  The Last Time I Saw Richard  were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment  In its lyrics  the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work  with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love  for example  in  California    Mitchell later remarked   At that period of my life  I had no personal defenses  I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes  I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn t pretend in my life to be strong    Mitchell made the decision to return to the live stage after the great success of Blue  and she presented many new songs on tour which would appear on her next album  Her fifth album  For the Roses  was released in October 1972 and immediately zoomed up the charts  She followed with the single   You Turn Me On  I m a Radio   which peaked at No  25 in the Billboard Charts in February 1973  becoming her first bonafide hit single  The album was critically acclaimed and earned her success on her own terms  though it was somewhat overshadowed by the success of Blue and by Mitchell s next album   Court and Spark  released in January 1974  would see Mitchell begin the flirtation with jazz and jazz fusion that marked her experimental period ahead  but it was also her most commercially successful recording  and among her most critically acclaimed  Court and Spark went to No  1 on the Cashbox Album Charts  The LP made Joni Mitchell a widely popular act for perhaps the only time in her career  on the strength of popular tracks such as the rocker  Raised on Robbery   which was released right before Christmas 1973  and  Help Me   which was released in March of the following year  and became Mitchell s only Top 10 single when it peaked at No  7 in the first week of June   Free Man in Paris  was another hit single and staple in her catalog   While recording Court and Spark  Mitchell had tried to make a clean break with her earlier folk sound  producing the album herself and employing jazz pop fusion band the L A  Express as what she called her first real backing group  In February 1974  her tour with the L A  Express began  and they received rave notices as they traveled across the United States and Canada during the next two months  A series of shows at L A  s Universal Amphitheater from August 14–17 were recorded for a live album release  In November  Mitchell released a live album called Miles of Aisles  a two record set including all but two songs from the L A  concerts  one selection each from the Berkeley Community Center  on March 2  and the LA Music Center  on March 4  were also included in the set   The live album slowly moved up to No  2  matching Court and Sparks s chart peak on Billboard   Big Yellow Taxi   the live version  was also released as a single and did reasonably well  Mitchell would ultimately release yet another recording of  Big Yellow Taxi  in 2007    In January 1975  Court and Spark received four nominations for Grammy Awards  including Grammy Award for Album of the Year  for which Mitchell was the only woman nominated  She won only the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist s   2 3  1975–1980  Jazz explorations  Mitchell went into the studio in the spring of 1975 to record acoustic demos of some songs that she had written since the Court and Spark tour ended  A few months later she recorded versions of the tunes with her band  Mitchell s musical interests were now diverging from both the folk and the pop scene of the era  toward less structured  more jazz inspired pieces  with a wider range of instruments  On  The Jungle Line   she also made an early effort at sampling a recording of African musicians  something that would become more commonplace among Western rock acts in the 1980s  Meanwhile   In France They Kiss on Main Street  continued the lush pop sounds of Court and Spark  and efforts such as the title song and  Edith and the Kingpin  chronicled the underbelly of suburban lives in Southern California   The new song cycle was released in November 1975 as The Hissing of Summer Lawns  The album was initially a big seller  peaking at No  4 on the Billboard Album Charts  but it received mixed reviews at the time of its release  A common legend holds that Rolling Stone magazine declared it the  Worst Album of the Year   in truth  it was called only the year s worst album title  However  Mitchell and Rolling Stone have had a contentious relationship  beginning years earlier when the magazine featured a  tree  illustrating all of Mitchell s alleged romantic partners  primarily other musicians  which the singer said  hurt my feelings terribly at the time   During 1975  Mitchell also participated in several concerts in the Rolling Thunder Revue tours featuring Bob Dylan and Joan Baez  and in 1976 she performed as part of The Last Waltz by The Band  In January 1976  Mitchell received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the album The Hissing of Summer Lawns  though the Grammy went to Linda Ronstadt   In early 1976  Mitchell traveled with friends who were driving cross country to Maine  Afterwards  Mitchell drove back to California alone and composed several songs during her journey which would feature on her next album  1976 s Hejira  She stated that  This album was written mostly while I was traveling in the car  That s why there were no piano songs     Hejira was arguably Mitchell s most experimental album so far  due to her ongoing collaborations with jazz virtuoso bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius on several songs  namely the first single   Coyote   the atmospheric  Hejira   the disorienting  guitar heavy  Black Crow   and the album s last song  Refuge of the Roads   The album climbed to No  13 on the Billboard Charts  reaching gold status three weeks after release  and received airplay from album oriented FM rock stations  Yet  Coyote   backed with  Blue Motel Room   failed to chart on the Hot 100  While the album was greeted by many fans and critics as a  return to form   by the time she recorded it her days as a huge pop star were over  However  if Hejira  did not sell as briskly as Mitchell s earlier  more  radio friendly  albums  its stature in her catalogue has grown over the years   Mitchell herself believes the album to be unique  In 2006 she said   I suppose a lot of people could have written a lot of my other songs  but I feel the songs on Hejira could only have come from me    In the summer of 1977  Mitchell began work on new recordings  that would become her first double studio album  Close to completing her contract with Asylum Records  Mitchell felt that this album could be looser in feel than any album she d done in the past  She invited Pastorius back  and he brought with him fellow members of jazz fusion pioneers Weather Report  including drummer Don Alias and saxophonist Wayne Shorter  Layered  atmospheric compositions such as  Overture   Cotton Avenue  featured more improvisatory collaboration  while  Paprika Plains  was a 16 minute epic that stretched the boundaries of pop  owing more to Mitchell s memories of childhood in Canada and her study of classical music   Dreamland  and  The Tenth World   featuring Chaka Khan on backing vocals  were percussion dominated tracks  Other songs continued the jazz rock folk collisions of Hejira  Mitchell also revived  Jericho   written but never recorded years earlier  a version is found on her 1974 live album   Don Juan s Reckless Daughter was released in December 1977  The album received mixed reviews but still sold relatively well  peaking at No  25 in the US and going gold within three months  The cover of the album created its own controversy  Mitchell was featured in several photographs on the cover  including one where she was disguised as a black man wearing a French beret  this is a reference to a character in one song on the album    A few months after the release of Don Juan s Reckless Daughter  Mitchell was contacted by jazz great Charles Mingus  who had heard the orchestrated song   Paprika Plains   and wanted her to work with him  Mitchell began a collaboration with Mingus  who died before the project was completed in 1979  She finished the tracks  and the resulting album  Mingus  was released in June 1979  though it was poorly received in the press  Fans were confused over such a major change in Mitchell s overall sound  and though the album topped out at No  17 on the Billboard album charts—a higher placement than Don Juan s Reckless Daughter—Mingus still fell short of gold status  making it her first album since the 1960s to not sell at least a half million copies   Mitchell s summer tour to promote Mingus began in August 1979 in Oklahoma City and concluded six weeks later with five shows at Los Angeles  Greek Theater  where she recorded and filmed the concerts  It was her first tour in several years  and with Pastorius  jazz guitar great Pat Metheny  and other members of her band  Mitchell also performed songs from her other jazz inspired albums  When the tour ended she began a year of work  turning the tapes from the Los Angeles shows into a two album set and a concert film  both to be called Shadows and Light  Her final release on Asylum Records and her second live double album  it was released in September 1980  and made it up to No  38 on the Billboard Charts  A single from the LP   Why Do Fools Fall in Love    Mitchell s duet with The Persuasions  her opening act for the tour   bubbled under on Billboard  just missing the Hot 100   2 4  1981–1993  Pop  electronics and protest  For a year and a half  Mitchell worked on the tracks for her next album  During this period Mitchell recorded with bassist Larry Klein  whom she married in 1982  While the album was being readied for release  her friend David Geffen  founder of Asylum Records  decided to start a new label  Geffen Records  Still distributed by Warner Bros    who controlled Asylum Records   Geffen negated the remaining contractual obligations Mitchell had with Asylum and signed her to his new label  Wild Things Run Fast  1982  marked a return to pop songwriting  including  Chinese Cafe Unchained Melody   which incorporated the chorus and parts of the melody of the famous Righteous Brothers hit  and   You re So Square  Baby I Don t Care   a remake of the Elvis chestnut which charted higher than any Mitchell single since her 1970s sales peak when it climbed to No  47 on the charts  The album peaked on the Billboard Charts in its fifth week at No  25   In early 1983  Mitchell began a world tour  visiting Japan  Australia  Ireland  the United Kingdom  Belgium  France  Germany  Italy  Scandinavia and then going back to the United States  A performance from the tour was videotaped and later released on home video  and later DVD  as Refuge of the Roads  As 1984 ended  Mitchell was writing new songs  when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition  British synth pop performer and producer Thomas Dolby was brought on board  Of Dolby s role  Mitchell later commented   I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record  by Geffen   and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player  So on that level we did have some problems    He may be able to do it faster  He may be able to do it better  but the fact is that it then wouldn t really be my music    The album that resulted  Dog Eat Dog  released in October 1985  turned out to be only a moderate seller  peaking at No  63 on Billboard s Top Albums Chart  Mitchell s lowest chart position since her first album peaked at No  189 almost eighteen years before  One of the songs on the album   Tax Free   created controversy by lambasting  televangelists  and what she saw as a drift to the religious right in American politics   The churches came after me   she wrote   they attacked me  though the Episcopalian Church  which I ve seen described as the only church in America which actually uses its head  wrote me a letter of congratulation    Mitchell continued experimenting with synthesizers  drum machines and sequencers for the recordings of her next album  1988 s Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm  She also collaborated with artists including Willie Nelson  Billy Idol  Wendy & Lisa  Tom Petty  Don Henley  Peter Gabriel  and Benjamin Orr of The Cars  The album s first official single   My Secret Place   was in fact a duet with Gabriel  and just missed the Billboard Hot 100 charts  The song  Lakota  was one of many songs on the album to take on larger political themes  in this case the Wounded Knee incident  the deadly battle between Native American activists and the FBI on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the previous decade  Musically  several songs fit into the trend of world music popularized by Gabriel during the era  Reviews were mostly favorable towards the album  and the cameos by well known musicians brought it considerable attention  Chalk Mark ultimately improved on the chart performance of Dog Eat Dog  peaking at No  45   In 1989  Mitchell provided background vocals for the hit single  Big Hard Sun  on Big Harvest  an album by fellow Canadian musician Gordon Peterson  released under the pseudonym INDIO  This song was later covered by Eddie Vedder and became the lead single on the Into the Wild soundtrack   In 1990  Mitchell  who by then rarely performed live anymore  participated in Roger Waters  The Wall Concert in Berlin  She performed the song  Goodbye Blue Sky  and was also one of the performers on the concert s final song  The Tide Is Turning  along with Waters  Cyndi Lauper  Bryan Adams  Van Morrison and Paul Carrack   Throughout the first half of 1990  Mitchell recorded songs that would appear on her next album  She delivered the final mixes for the new album to Geffen just before Christmas  after trying nearly a hundred different sequences for the songs  The album Night Ride Home was released in March 1991  In the United States  it premiered on Billboard s Top Album charts at No  68  moving up to No  48 in its second week  and peaking at No  41 in its sixth week  In the United Kingdom  the album premiered at No  25 on the album charts  Critically  it was better received than her 1980s work and seemed to signal a move closer to her acoustic beginnings  along with some references to the style of Hejira  This album was also Mitchell s first since Geffen Records was sold to MCA Inc   meaning that Night Ride Home was her first album not to be initially distributed by WEA  now Warner Music Group    2 5  1994–2001  Resurgence and vocal development  To wider audiences  the real  return to form  for Mitchell came with the 1994 s Grammy winning Turbulent Indigo  While the recording period also saw the divorce of Mitchell and bassist Larry Klein  their marriage having lasted almost 12 years  Indigo was seen as Mitchell s most accessible set of songs in years  Songs such as  Sex Kills    Sunny Sunday    Borderline  and  The Magdalene Laundries  mixed social commentary and guitar focused melodies for  a startling comeback   The album won two Grammy awards  including Best Pop Album  and it coincided with a much publicized resurgence in interest in Mitchell s work by a younger generation of singer songwriters   In 1996  Mitchell agreed to release a greatest Hits collection when label Reprise also allowed her a second Misses album to include some of the lesser known songs from her career  Hits charted at No  161 in the US  but made No  6 in the UK  Mitchell also included on Hits  for the first time on an album  her first recording  a version of  Urge for Going  which preceded Song to a Seagull but was previously released only as a B side   Two years later  Mitchell released her final set of  original  new work before nearly a decade of other pursuits  1998 s Taming the Tiger  She promoted Tiger with a return to regular concert appearances  most notably a co headlining tour with Bob Dylan and Van Morrison  On the album  Mitchell had played a  guitar synthesizer  on most songs  and for the tour she adapted many of her old songs to this instrument  and reportedly had to re learn all her complex tunings once again   It was around this time that critics also began to notice a real change in Mitchell s voice  particularly on her older songs  the singer later admitted to feeling the same way  explaining that  I d go to hit a note and there was nothing there   While her more limited range and huskier vocals have sometimes been attributed to her smoking  she has been described as  one of the world s last great smokers    Mitchell believes that the changes in her voice that became noticeable in the 1990s were due to other problems  including vocal nodules  a compressed larynx  and the lingering effects of having had polio  In an interview in 2004  she denied that  my terrible habits  had anything to do with her more limited range and pointed out that singers often lose the upper register when they pass fifty  In addition  she contended that in her opinion her voice became a more interesting and expressive alto range when she could no longer hit the high notes  let alone hold them like she did in her youth   The singer s next two albums featured no new songs and  Mitchell has said  were recorded to  fulfill contractual obligations   but on both she attempted to make use of her new vocal range in interpreting familiar material  Both Sides  Now  2000  was an album composed mostly of covers of jazz standards  performed with an orchestra  featuring orchestral arrangements by Vince Mendoza  The album also contained remakes of  A Case of You  and the title track  Both Sides Now   two early hits transposed down to Mitchell s now dusky  soulful alto range  It received mostly strong reviews and spawned a short national tour  with Mitchell accompanied by a core band featuring Larry Klein on bass plus a local orchestra on each tour stop  Its success led to 2002 s Travelogue  a collection of re workings of her previous songs with lush orchestral accompaniments   2 6  2002–2005  Retirement and retrospectives  Mitchell stated at the time that this would be her final album  In a 2002 interview with Rolling Stone  she voiced discontent with the current state of the music industry  describing it as a  cesspool   Mitchell expressed her dislike of the record industry s dominance and her desire to control her own destiny  possibly by releasing her own music over the Internet   During the next few years  the only albums Mitchell released were compilations of her earlier work  In 2003  Mitchell s Geffen recordings were collected in a remastered  four disc box set  The Complete Geffen Recordings  including notes by Mitchell and three previously unreleased tracks  A series of themed compilations of songs from earlier albums were also released  The Beginning of Survival  2004   Dreamland  2004   and Songs of a Prairie Girl  2005   the last of which collected the threads of her Canadian upbringing and which she released after accepting an invitation to the Saskatchewan Centennial concert in Saskatoon  The concert  which featured a tribute to Mitchell  was also attended by Elizabeth II  In Prairie Girl liner notes  she writes that the collection is  my contribution to Saskatchewan s Centennial celebrations    In the early 1990s  Mitchell signed a deal with Random House to publish an autobiography  In 1998 she told The New York Times that her memoirs were  in the works   that they would be published in as many as four volumes  and that the first line would be  I was the only black man at the party   In 2005  Mitchell said that she was using a tape recorder to get her memories  down in the oral tradition    Also in the early 2000s  Mitchell worked with artist Gilles Hebert  She visited the Mendel Art Gallery in Saskatoon  where they produced a book called Voices  The book received international attention and extended her fame  and the fame of Gilles Hebert   Although Mitchell stated that she would no longer tour or give concerts  she has made occasional public appearances to speak on environmental issues  Mitchell divides her time between her longtime home in Los Angeles  and the property in Sechelt  British Columbia that she has owned since the early 1970s   L A  is my workplace   she said in 2006   B C  is my heartbeat   According to interviews  today she focuses mainly on her visual art  which she does not sell and which she displays only on rare occasions   2 7  2006–2009  Late recordings and Morgellons advocacy  In an interview with The Ottawa Citizen in October 2006  Mitchell  revealed that she was recording her first collection of new songs in nearly a decade   but gave few other details  Four months later  in an interview with The New York Times  Mitchell said that the forthcoming album  titled Shine  was inspired by the war in Iraq and  something her grandson had said while listening to family fighting   Bad dreams are good—in the great plan    Early media reports characterized the album as having  a minimal feel    that harks back to  Mitchell s  early work   and a focus on political and environmental issues   In February 2007  Mitchell also returned to Calgary and served as an advisor for the Alberta Ballet Company premiere of  The Fiddle and the Drum   a dance choreographed to both new and old songs  Mitchell also filmed portions of the rehearsals for a documentary that she is working on  Of the flurry of recent activity she quipped   I ve never worked so hard in my life    In summer 2007  Mitchell s official fan run site confirmed speculation that she had signed a two record deal with Starbucks  Hear Music label  Shine was released by the label on September 25  2007  debuting at number 14 on the Billboard 200 album chart  her highest chart position in the United States since the release of Hejira in 1976  over thirty years previously  and at number 36 on the United Kingdom albums chart   On the same day  Herbie Hancock  a longtime associate and friend of Mitchell s  released River  The Joni Letters  an album paying tribute to Mitchell s work  Among the album s contributors were Norah Jones  Tina Turner  Leonard Cohen  and Mitchell herself  who contributed a vocal to the re recording of  The Tea Leaf Prophecy  Lay Down Your Arms    originally on her album Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm   On February 10  2008  Hancock s recording won Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards  It was the first time in 43 years that a jazz artist took the top prize at the annual award ceremony  In accepting the award  Hancock paid tribute to Mitchell as well as to Miles Davis and John Coltrane  At the same ceremony Mitchell won a Grammy for Best Instrumental Pop Performance for the opening track  One Week Last Summer  from her album Shine   Mitchell believes she suffers from a condition called  Morgellons syndrome   However it is not a medically recognized disease  it is self diagnosed and understood by the medical community to be the product of delusion  Mitchell spoke to the Los Angeles Times on April 22  2010 about Morgellons  saying   I have this weird  incurable disease that seems like it s from outer space  but my health s the best it s been in a while   Mitchell said at that time that she planned to leave the music industry to work toward giving people diagnosed with Morgellons more credibility   In the same interview  Mitchell made the statement that singer songwriter Bob Dylan  with whom she had worked closely in the past  was a fake and plagiarist  The controversial remark was widely reported by other media  Mitchell did not explain the contention further  but several media outlets speculated that it may have related to the allegations of plagiarism surrounding some lyrics on Dylan s 2006 album Modern Times  In a 2013 interview with Jian Ghomeshi  she was asked about the comments and responded by denying that she had made the statement while mentioning the allegations of plagiarism that arose over the lyrics to Dylan s 2001 album Love and Theft in the general context of the flow and ebb of the creative process of artists   3  Legacy  3 1  Guitar style  While some of Mitchell s most popular songs were written on piano  almost every song she composed on the guitar uses an open  or non standard  tuning  she has written songs in some 50 tunings  playing what she has called  Joni s weird chords   The use of alternative tunings allows guitarists to produce accompaniment with more varied and wide ranging textures  Her right hand picking strumming technique has evolved over the years from an initially intricate picking style  typified by the guitar songs on her first album  to a looser and more rhythmic style  sometimes incorporating percussive  slaps    In 1995  Mitchell s friend Fred Walecki  proprietor of Westwood Music in Los Angeles  developed a solution to alleviate her continuing frustration with using multiple alternative tunings in live settings  Walecki designed a Stratocaster style guitar to function with the Roland VG 8  Virtual Guitar   a system capable of configuring her numerous tunings electronically  While the guitar itself remained in standard tuning  the VG 8 encoded the pickup signals into digital signals which were then translated into the altered tunings  This allowed Mitchell to use one guitar on stage  while an off stage tech entered the preprogrammed tuning for each song in her set   Mitchell s longtime archivist  the San Francisco based Joel Bernstein  maintains a detailed list of all her tunings  and has assisted her to relearn the tunings for several older songs   Mitchell was also highly innovative harmonically in her early work  1966–72  using techniques including modality  chromaticism  and pedal points  On her 1968 debut album Song to a Seagull  Joni Mitchell used both quartal and quintal harmony in  Dawntreader   and she used quintal harmony in Seagull   In 2003 Rolling Stone named her the 72nd greatest guitarist of all time  she was the highest ranked woman on the list   3 2  Influence on other artists  Mitchell s work has had an influence on many other artists  including Mikael Åkerfeldt from Opeth  Marillion members Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery  their former vocalist and lyricist Fish  Paul Carrack  and Taylor Swift  Madonna has also cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke to her as a teenager   I was really  really into Joni Mitchell  I knew every word to Court and Spark  I worshipped her when I was in high school  Blue is amazing  I would have to say of all the women I ve heard  she had the most profound effect on me from a lyrical point of view    A number of artists have had success covering Mitchell s songs  Judy Collins s 1967 recording of  Both Sides Now  reached No  8 on Billboard charts and was a breakthrough in the career of both artists  Mitchell s own recording did not see release until two years later  on her second album Clouds   This is Mitchell s most covered song by far  with over 1 000 versions recorded at latest count  Hole also covered  Both Sides Now  in 1991 on their debut album  Pretty on the Inside  retitling it  Clouds   with the lyrics altered by frontwoman Courtney Love  Pop group Neighborhood in 1970 and Amy Grant in 1995 scored hits with covers of  Big Yellow Taxi   the third most covered song in Mitchell s repertoire  with over 300 covers   Recent releases of this song have been by Counting Crows in 2002 and Nena in 2007  Janet Jackson used a sample of the chorus of  Big Yellow Taxi  as the centerpiece of her 1997 hit single  Got  Til It s Gone   which also features rapper Q Tip saying  Joni Mitchell never lies    River   from Joni s album Blue became the second most covered song of Mitchell s in 2013 as a great number of artists chose it for their holiday albums  Rap artists Kanye West and Mac Dre have also sampled Mitchell s vocals in their music  In addition  Annie Lennox has covered  Ladies of the Canyon  for the B side of her 1995 hit  No More I Love You s   Mandy Moore covered  Help Me  in 2003  In 2004 singer George Michael covered her song  Edith and the Kingpin  for a radio show   River  has been one of the most popular songs covered in recent years  with versions by Dianne Reeves  1999   James Taylor  recorded for television in 2000  and for CD release in 2004   Allison Crowe  2004   Rachael Yamagata  2004   Aimee Mann  2005   and Sarah McLachlan  2006   McLachlan also did a version of  Blue  in 1996  and Cat Power recorded a cover of  Blue  in 2008  Other Mitchell covers include the famous  Woodstock  by both Crosby  Stills  Nash and Young and Matthews Southern Comfort   This Flight Tonight  by Nazareth  and well known versions of  Woodstock  by Eva Cassidy and  A Case of You  by Tori Amos  Michelle Branch  Jane Monheit  Prince  Diana Krall  James Blake  and Ana Moura  A 40th anniversary version of  Woodstock  was released in 2009 by Nick Vernier Band featuring Ian Matthews  formerly of Matthews Southern Comfort    Prince s version of  A Case of U  appeared on A Tribute to Joni Mitchell  a 2007 compilation released by Nonesuch Records  which also featured Björk   The Boho Dance    Caetano Veloso   Dreamland    Emmylou Harris   The Magdalene Laundries    Sufjan Stevens   Free Man in Paris   and Cassandra Wilson   For the Roses    among others  Some of the recordings were made in the late 1990s when a project entitled A Case of Joni was developed but left incomplete  Among those who recorded tracks for the first tribute album  which remain unreleased  were Janet Jackson  Steely Dan  and Sheryl Crow  Chaka Khan recorded  Ladies Man  from Mitchell s LP Wild Things Run Fast on her 2007 CD titled Funk This   Several other songs reference Joni Mitchell  The song  Our House  by Graham Nash refers to Nash s two year affair with Mitchell at the time that Crosby  Stills  Nash and Young recorded the Déjà Vu album  Led Zeppelin s  Going to California  was said to be written about Robert Plant and Jimmy Page s infatuation with Mitchell  a claim that seems to be borne out by the fact that  in live performances  Plant often says  Joni  after the line  To find a queen without a king  they say she plays guitar and cries and sings   Jimmy Page uses a double dropped D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings Mitchell uses  The Sonic Youth song  Hey Joni  is named for Mitchell  Alanis Morissette also mentions Mitchell in one of her songs   Your House   British folk singer Frank Turner mentions Mitchell in his song  Sunshine State   The Prince song  The Ballad of Dorothy Parker  contains the lyric –    Oh  my favorite song  she said – and it was Joni singing  Help me I think I m falling     Prince s band members Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman claim to have introduced him to Joni s music during the recording of Purple Rain   Lavender  by Marillion was partly influenced by  going through parks listening to Joni Mitchell   according to vocalist and lyricist Fish  John Mayer makes reference to Mitchell and her Blue album in his song  Queen of California   from his 2012 album Born and Raised  The song contains the lyric  Joni wrote Blue in a house by the sea    In 2003  playwright Bryden MacDonald launched When All the Slaves Are Free  a musical revue based on Mitchell s music   Mitchell s music and poems have deeply influenced the French painter Jacques Benoit s work  Between 1979 and 1989 Benoit produced sixty paintings  corresponding to a selection of fifty of Mitchell s songs   To celebrate Mitchell s 70th birthday  the 2013 Luminato Festival in
