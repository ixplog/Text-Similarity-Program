The Declaration of Independence is the usual name of a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4  1776  which announced that the thirteen American colonies  then at war with Great Britain  regarded themselves as thirteen newly independent sovereign states  and no longer a part of the British Empire  Instead they formed a new nation—the United States of America  John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence  which was unanimously approved on July 2  A committee of five had already drafted the formal declaration  to be ready when Congress voted on independence  The term  Declaration of Independence  is not used in the document itself   Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document  which Congress would edit to produce the final version  The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain  more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War  The national birthday  Independence Day  is celebrated on July 4  although Adams wanted July 2   After ratifying the text on July 4  Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms  It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public  The source copy used for this printing has been lost  and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson s hand  Jefferson s original draft  complete with changes made by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin  and Jefferson s notes of changes made by Congress  are preserved at the Library of Congress  The most famous version of the Declaration  a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the official document  is displayed at the National Archives in Washington  D C  This engrossed copy was ordered by Congress on July 19  and signed primarily on August 2   The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry  The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against King George III  and by asserting certain natural and legal rights  including a right of revolution  Having served its original purpose in announcing independence  references to the text of the Declaration were few for the next four score years  Abraham Lincoln made it the centerpiece of his rhetoric  as in the Gettysburg Address of 1863   and his policies  Since then  it has become a well known statement on human rights  particularly its second sentence   We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights  that among these are Life  Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness  This has been called  one of the best known sentences in the English language   containing  the most potent and consequential words in American history   The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive  This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln  who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy  and argued that the Declaration is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted   It provided inspiration to numerous national declarations of independence throughout the world  Historian David Armitage  after examining the influence of the American  Declaration  on over 100 other declarations of independence  says   1  Background  By the time the Declaration of Independence was adopted in July 1776  the Thirteen Colonies and Great Britain had been at war for more than a year  Relations between the colonies and the mother country had been deteriorating since the end of the Seven Years  War in 1763  The war had plunged the British government deep into debt  and so Parliament enacted a series of measures to increase tax revenue from the colonies  Parliament believed that these acts  such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767  were a legitimate means of having the colonies pay their fair share of the costs to keep the colonies in the British Empire   Many colonists  however  had developed a different conception of the empire  Because the colonies were not directly represented in Parliament  colonists argued that Parliament had no right to levy taxes upon them  This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament s authority in the colonies  The orthodox British view  dating from the Glorious Revolution of 1688  was that Parliament was the supreme authority throughout the empire  and so by definition anything Parliament did was constitutional  In the colonies  however  the idea had developed that the British Constitution recognized certain fundamental rights that no government—not even Parliament—could violate  After the Townshend Acts  some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in the colonies at all  Anticipating the arrangement of the British Commonwealth  by 1774 American writers such as Samuel Adams  James Wilson  and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only  and that the colonies  which had their own legislatures  were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown   1 1  Congress convenes  The issue of Parliament s authority in the colonies became a crisis after Parliament passed the Coercive Acts in 1774 to punish the Province of Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party of 1773  Many colonists saw the Coercive Acts as a violation of the British Constitution and thus a threat to the liberties of all of British America  In September 1774  the First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia to coordinate a response  Congress organized a boycott of British goods and petitioned the king for repeal of the acts  These measures were unsuccessful because King George III and the ministry of Prime Minister Lord North were determined not to retreat on the question of parliamentary supremacy  As the king wrote to North in November 1774   blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent    Even after fighting in the American Revolutionary War began at Lexington and Concord in April 1775  most colonists still hoped for reconciliation with Great Britain  When the Second Continental Congress convened at the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia in May 1775  some delegates hoped for eventual independence  but no one yet advocated declaring it  Although many colonists no longer believed that Parliament had any sovereignty over them  they still professed loyalty to King George  whom they hoped would intercede on their behalf  They were to be disappointed  in late 1775  the king rejected Congress s second petition  issued a Proclamation of Rebellion  and announced before Parliament on October 26 that he was considering  friendly offers of foreign assistance  to suppress the rebellion  A pro American minority in Parliament warned that the government was driving the colonists toward independence   2  Toward independence  In January 1776  just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined to act as a conciliator  Thomas Paine s pamphlet Common Sense was published  Paine  who had only recently arrived in the colonies from England  argued in favor of colonial independence  advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule  Common Sense introduced no new ideas  and probably had little direct effect on Congress s thinking about independence  its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss  Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine s enormously popular pamphlet  Although some colonists still held out hope for reconciliation  developments in early 1776 further strengthened public support for independence  In February 1776  colonists learned of Parliament s passage of the Prohibitory Act  which established a blockade of American ports and declared American ships to be enemy vessels  John Adams  a strong supporter of independence  believed that Parliament had effectively declared American independence before Congress had been able to  Adams labeled the Prohibitory Act the  Act of Independency   calling it  a compleat Dismemberment of the British Empire   Support for declaring independence grew even more when it was confirmed that King George had hired German mercenaries to use against his American subjects   Despite this growing popular support for independence  Congress lacked the clear authority to declare it  Delegates had been elected to Congress by thirteen different governments—which included extralegal conventions  ad hoc committees  and elected assemblies—and were bound by the instructions given to them  Regardless of their personal opinions  delegates could not vote to declare independence unless their instructions permitted such an action  Several colonies  in fact  expressly prohibited their delegates from taking any steps towards separation from Great Britain  while other delegations had instructions that were ambiguous on the issue  As public sentiment for separation from Great Britain grew  advocates of independence sought to have the Congressional instructions revised  For Congress to declare independence  a majority of delegations would need authorization to vote for independence  and at least one colonial government would need to specifically instruct  or grant permission for  its delegation to propose a declaration of independence in Congress  Between April and July 1776  a  complex political war  was waged to bring this about   2 1  Revising instructions  In the campaign to revise Congressional instructions  many Americans formally expressed their support for separation from Great Britain in what were effectively state and local declarations of independence  Historian Pauline Maier identified more than ninety such declarations that were issued throughout the Thirteen Colonies from April to July 1776  These  declarations  took a variety of forms  Some were formal  written instructions for Congressional delegations  such as the Halifax Resolves of April 12  with which North Carolina became the first colony to explicitly authorize its delegates to vote for independence  Others were legislative acts that officially ended British rule in individual colonies  such as on May 4  when the Rhode Island legislature became the first to declare its independence from Great Britain  Many  declarations  were resolutions adopted at town or county meetings that offered support for independence  A few came in the form of jury instructions  such as the statement issued on April 23  1776  by Chief Justice William Henry Drayton of South Carolina   the law of the land authorizes me to declare   that George the Third  King of Great Britain   has no authority over us  and we owe no obedience to him   Most of these declarations are now obscure  having been overshadowed by the declaration approved by Congress on July 4   Some colonies held back from endorsing independence  Resistance was centered in the middle colonies of New York  New Jersey  Maryland  Pennsylvania  and Delaware  Advocates of independence saw Pennsylvania as the key  if that colony could be converted to the pro independence cause  it was believed that the others would follow  On May 1  however  opponents of independence retained control of the Pennsylvania Assembly in a special election that had focused on the question of independence  In response  on May 10 Congress passed a resolution  which had been promoted by John Adams and Richard Henry Lee  calling on colonies without a  government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs  to adopt new governments  The resolution passed unanimously  and was even supported by Pennsylvania s John Dickinson  the leader of the anti independence faction in Congress  who believed that it did not apply to his colony   2 2  May 15 preamble  As was the custom  Congress appointed a committee to draft a preamble to explain the purpose of the resolution  John Adams wrote the preamble  which stated that because King George had rejected reconciliation and was hiring foreign mercenaries to use against the colonies   it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed   Adams s preamble was meant to encourage the overthrow of the governments of Pennsylvania and Maryland  which were still under proprietary governance  Congress passed the preamble on May 15 after several days of debate  but four of the middle colonies voted against it  and the Maryland delegation walked out in protest  Adams regarded his May 15 preamble effectively as an American declaration of independence  although a formal declaration would still have to be made   2 3  Lee s resolution and the final push  On the same day that Congress passed Adams s radical preamble  the Virginia Convention set the stage for a formal Congressional declaration of independence  On May 15  the Convention instructed Virginia s congressional delegation  to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent States  absolved from all allegiance to  or dependence upon  the Crown or Parliament of Great Britain   In accordance with those instructions  Richard Henry Lee of Virginia presented a three part resolution to Congress on June 7  The motion  which was seconded by John Adams  called on Congress to declare independence  form foreign alliances  and prepare a plan of colonial confederation  The part of the resolution relating to declaring independence read   Resolved  that these United Colonies are  and of right ought to be  free and independent States  that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown  and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is  and ought to be  totally dissolved  Lee s resolution met with resistance in the ensuing debate  Opponents of the resolution  while conceding that reconciliation with Great Britain was unlikely  argued that declaring independence was premature  and that securing foreign aid should take priority  Advocates of the resolution countered that foreign governments would not intervene in an internal British struggle  and so a formal declaration of independence was needed before foreign aid was possible  All Congress needed to do  they insisted  was to  declare a fact which already exists   Delegates from Pennsylvania  Delaware  New Jersey  Maryland  and New York were still not yet authorized to vote for independence  however  and some of them threatened to leave Congress if the resolution were adopted  Congress therefore voted on June 10 to postpone further discussion of Lee s resolution for three weeks  Until then  Congress decided that a committee should prepare a document announcing and explaining independence in the event that Lee s resolution was approved when it was brought up again in July   Support for a Congressional declaration of independence was consolidated in the final weeks of June 1776  On June 14  the Connecticut Assembly instructed its delegates to propose independence  and the following day the legislatures of New Hampshire and Delaware authorized their delegates to declare independence  In Pennsylvania  political struggles ended with the dissolution of the colonial assembly  and on June 18 a new Conference of Committees under Thomas McKean authorized Pennsylvania s delegates to declare independence  On June 15  the Provincial Congress of New Jersey  which had been governing the province since January 1776  resolved that Royal Governor William Franklin was  an enemy to the liberties of this country  and had him arrested  On June 21  they chose new delegates to Congress and empowered them to join in a declaration of independence   Only Maryland and New York had yet to authorize independence  When the Continental Congress had adopted Adams s radical May 15 preamble  Maryland s delegates walked out and sent to the Maryland Convention for instructions  On May 20  the Maryland Convention rejected Adams s preamble  instructing its delegates to remain against independence  but Samuel Chase went to Maryland and  thanks to local resolutions in favor of independence  was able to get the Maryland Convention to change its mind on June 28  Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions  When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8  the New York Provincial Congress told the delegates to wait  But on June 30  the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached  and would not convene again until July 10  This meant that New York s delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision   3  Draft and adoption  While political maneuvering was setting the stage for an official declaration of independence  a document explaining the decision was being written  On June 11  1776  Congress appointed a  Committee of Five   consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts  Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania  Thomas Jefferson of Virginia  Robert R  Livingston of New York  and Roger Sherman of Connecticut  to draft a declaration  Because the committee left no minutes  there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded—accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams  although frequently cited  are contradictory and not entirely reliable  What is certain is that the committee  after discussing the general outline that the document should follow  decided that Jefferson would write the first draft  The committee in general  and Jefferson in particular  thought Adams should write the document  but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with Jefferson personally  Considering Congress s busy schedule  Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days  and likely wrote the draft quickly  He then consulted the others  made some changes  and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations  The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28  1776  The title of the document was  A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America  in General Congress assembled    Congress ordered that the draft  lie on the table   For two days Congress methodically edited Jefferson s primary document  shortening it by a fourth  removing unnecessary wording  and improving sentence structure  Congress removed Jefferson s assertion that Britain had forced slavery on the colonies  in order to moderate the document and appease persons in Britain who supported the Revolution  Although Jefferson wrote that Congress had  mangled  his draft version  the Declaration that was finally produced  according to his biographer John Ferling  was  the majestic document that inspired both contemporaries and posterity    On Monday  July 1  having tabled the draft of the declaration  Congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole  with Benjamin Harrison of Virginia presiding  and resumed debate on Lee s resolution of independence  John Dickinson made one last effort to delay the decision  arguing that Congress should not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the Articles of Confederation  John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson  restating the case for an immediate declaration   After a long day of speeches  a vote was taken  As always  each colony cast a single vote  the delegation for each colony—numbering two to seven members—voted amongst themselves to determine the colony s vote  Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence  The New York delegation  lacking permission to vote for independence  abstained  Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean  who voted yes  and George Read  who voted no   The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence  which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole  The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by the Congress itself  Edward Rutledge of South Carolina  who was opposed to Lee s resolution but desirous of unanimity  moved that the vote be postponed until the following day   On July 2  South Carolina reversed its position and voted for independence  In the Pennsylvania delegation  Dickinson and Robert Morris abstained  allowing the delegation to vote three to two in favor of independence  The tie in the Delaware delegation was broken by the timely arrival of Caesar Rodney  who voted for independence  The New York delegation abstained once again  since they were still not authorized to vote for independence  although they would be allowed to do so by the New York Provincial Congress a week later  The resolution of independence had been adopted with twelve affirmative votes and one abstention  With this  the colonies had officially severed political ties with Great Britain  In a now famous letter written to his wife on the following day  John Adams predicted that July 2 would become a great American holiday  Adams thought that the vote for independence would be commemorated  he did not foresee that Americans—including himself—would instead celebrate Independence Day on the date that the announcement of that act was finalized   After voting in favor of the resolution of independence  Congress turned its attention to the committee s draft of the declaration  Over several days of debate  Congress made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text  most notably a passage critical of the slave trade  changes that Jefferson resented  On July 4  1776  the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication   4  Annotated text of the engrossed Declaration  The Declaration is not divided into formal sections  but it is often discussed as consisting of five parts  Introduction  the Preamble  the Indictment of George III  the Denunciation of the British people  and the Conclusion   5  Influences  Historians have often sought to identify the sources that most influenced the words and political philosophy of the Declaration of Independence  By Jefferson s own admission  the Declaration contained no original ideas  but was instead a statement of sentiments widely shared by supporters of the American Revolution  As he explained in 1825   Neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment  nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing  it was intended to be an expression of the American mind  and to give to that expression the proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion  Jefferson s most immediate sources were two documents written in June 1776  his own draft of the preamble of the Constitution of Virginia  and George Mason s draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights  Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence  They were  in turn  directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights  which formally ended the reign of King James II  During the American Revolution  Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights as a model of how to end the reign of an unjust king  The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath  1320  and the Dutch Act of Abjuration  1581  have also been offered as models for Jefferson s Declaration  but these models are now accepted by few scholars   Jefferson wrote that a number of authors exerted a general influence on the words of the Declaration  The English political theorist John Locke  whom Jefferson called one of  the three greatest men that have ever lived   is usually cited as one of the primary influences  In 1922  historian Carl L  Becker wrote that  Most Americans had absorbed Locke s works as a kind of political gospel  and the Declaration  in its form  in its phraseology  follows closely certain sentences in Locke s second treatise on government   The extent of Locke s influence on the American Revolution has been questioned by some subsequent scholars  however  Historian Ray Forrest Harvey declared in 1937  as he argued for the dominant influence of the Swiss jurist Jean Jacques Burlamaqui  that Jefferson and Locke were at  two opposite poles  in their political philosophy  as evidenced by Jefferson s use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase  pursuit of happiness  instead of  property   Other scholars emphasized the influence of republicanism rather than Locke s classical liberalism  Historian Garry Wills argued that Jefferson was influenced by the Scottish Enlightenment  particularly Francis Hutcheson  rather than Locke  an interpretation that has been strongly criticized   Legal historian John Phillip Reid has written that the emphasis on the political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced  The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights  argues Reid  but is instead a legal document—an indictment against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists  In contrast  historian Dennis J  Mahoney argues that the Declaration is not a legal document at all  but a philosophical document influenced by Emerich de Vattel  Jean Jacques Burlamaqui  and Samuel Pufendorf  Historian David Armitage has argued that the Declaration is a document of international law  According to Armitage  the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel s The Law of Nations  a book that Benjamin Franklin said was  continually in the hands of the members of our Congress   Armitage writes that because  Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood   the primary purpose of the Declaration was  to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States   If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers  the American revolutionaries had first to make it clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain   6  Signing  The Declaration became official when Congress voted for it on July 4  signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official  The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4  1776  The signatures of fifty six delegates are affixed  however  the exact date each person signed it has long been the subject of debate  Jefferson  Franklin  and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4  But in 1796  signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4  pointing out that some signers were not then present  including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date   According to the 1911 record of events by the U S  State Department  under Secretary Philander C  Knox  the Declaration was transposed on paper  adopted by the Continental Congress  and signed by John Hancock  President of the Congress  on July 4  1776  On August 2  1776  a parchment paper copy of the Declaration was signed by 56 persons  Many of these signers were not present when the original Declaration was adopted on July 4  One signer  Matthew Thornton from New Hampshire  who was seated in the Continental Congress in November  asked for and received the privilege of adding his signature at that time  and signed on November 4  1776   Historians have generally accepted McKean s version of events  arguing that the famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19  and was not signed by Congress until August 2  1776  In 1986  legal historian Wilfred Ritz argued that historians had misunderstood the primary documents and given too much credence to McKean  who had not been present in Congress on July 4  According to Ritz  about thirty four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4  and the others signed on or after August 2  Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates signed on August 2  and that those eventual signers who were not present added their names later  Two future U S  presidents  Thomas Jefferson and John Adams  were among the signatories   The most famous signature on the engrossed copy is that of John Hancock  who  as President of Congress  presumably signed first  Hancock s large  flamboyant signature became iconic  and John Hancock emerged in the United States as an informal synonym for  signature   A commonly circulated but apocryphal account claims that after Hancock signed  the delegate from Massachusetts commented   The British ministry can read that name without spectacles   Another apocryphal report indicates that Hancock proudly declared   There  I guess King George will be able to read that    Various legends about the signing of the Declaration emerged years later  when the document had become an important national symbol  In one famous story  John Hancock supposedly said that Congress  having signed the Declaration  must now  all hang together   and Benjamin Franklin replied   Yes  we must indeed all hang together  or most assuredly we shall all hang separately   The quotation did not appear in print until more than fifty years after Franklin s death   The Syng inkstand  used at the signing  was also used at the signing of the United States Constitution in 1787   7  Publication and reaction  After Congress approved the final wording of the Declaration on July 4  a handwritten copy was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap  Through the night Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution  Before long  the Declaration was read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers across the thirteen states  The first official public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8  public readings also took place on that day in Trenton  New Jersey  and Easton  Pennsylvania  A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9   President of Congress John Hancock sent a broadside to General George Washington  instructing him to have it proclaimed  at the Head of the Army in the way you shall think it most proper   Washington had the Declaration read to his troops in New York City on July 9  with thousands of British troops on ships in the harbor  Washington and Congress hoped the Declaration would inspire the soldiers  and encourage others to join the army  After hearing the Declaration  crowds in many cities tore down and destroyed signs or statues representing royal authority  An equestrian statue of King George in New York City was pulled down and the lead used to make musket balls   British officials in North America sent copies of the Declaration to Great Britain  It was published in British newspapers beginning in mid August  it had reached Florence and Warsaw by mid September  and a German translation appeared in Switzerland by October  The first copy of the Declaration sent to France got lost  and the second copy arrived only in November 1776  It reached Portuguese America by Brazilian medical student ‘Vendek’ José Joaquim Maia e Barbalho  who had met with Thomas Jefferson in Nîmes in 1786  Though the Spanish American authorities banned the circulation of the Declaration  it was widely transmitted and translated  by the Venezuelan Manuel García de Sena  by the Colombian Miguel de Pombo  by the Ecuadorian Vicente Rocafuerte and by the New Englanders Richard Cleveland and William Shaler  who distributed the Declaration and the United States Constitution among creoles in Chile and Indians in Mexico in 1821  The North Ministry did not give an official answer to the Declaration  but instead secretly commissioned pamphleteer John Lind to publish a response  which was entitled Answer to the Declaration of the American Congress  British Tories denounced the signers of the Declaration for not applying the same principles of  life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness  to African Americans  Thomas Hutchinson  the former royal governor of Massachusetts  also published a rebuttal  These pamphlets challenged various aspects of the Declaration  Hutchinson argued that the American Revolution was the work of a few conspirators who wanted independence from the outset  and who had finally achieved it by inducing otherwise loyal colonists to rebel  Lind s pamphlet had an anonymous attack on the concept of natural rights  written by Jeremy Bentham  an argument which he would repeat during the French Revolution  Both pamphlets asked how the American slaveholders in Congress could proclaim that  all men are created equal  without freeing their own slaves   William Whipple  a signer of the Declaration of Independence who had fought in the war  freed his slave  Prince Whipple  because of revolutionary ideals  In the postwar decades  other slaveholders also freed their slaves  from 1790 to 1810  the percentage of free blacks in the Upper South increased to 8 3 percent from less than one percent of the black population  All Northern states abolished slavery by 1804   8  History of the documents  The official copy was the one printed on July 4  1776 under Jefferson s supervision  It was sent to the states and the Army  and was widely reprinted in newspapers  The slightly different  engrossed copy   shown at the top of this article  was made later for members to sign  The engrossed version is the one widely distributed in the 21st century  Note the opening lines of the two version differ   The copy of the Declaration that was signed by Congress is known as the engrossed or parchment copy  It was probably engrossed  that is  carefully handwritten  by clerk Timothy Matlack  Because of poor conservation of the engrossed copy through the 19th century  a facsimile made in 1823  rather than the original  has become the basis of most modern reproductions  In 1921  custody of the engrossed copy of the Declaration  along with the United States Constitution  was transferred from the State Department to the Library of Congress  After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941  the documents were moved for safekeeping to the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox in Kentucky  where they were kept until 1944  In 1952  the engrossed Declaration was transferred to the National Archives  and is now on permanent display at the National Archives in the  Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom    Although the document signed by Congress and enshrined in the National Archives is usually regarded as the Declaration of Independence  historian Julian P  Boyd argued that the Declaration  like Magna Carta  is not a single document  Boyd considered the printed broadsides ordered by Congress to be official texts as well  The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by John Dunlap of Philadelphia  Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides  of which 26 are known to survive  The 26th copy was discovered in The National Archives in England in 2009  In 1777  Congress commissioned Mary Katherine Goddard to print a new broadside that  unlike the Dunlap broadside  listed the signers of the Declaration  Nine copies of the Goddard broadside are known to still exist  A variety of broadsides printed by the states are also extant   Several early handwritten copies and drafts of the Declaration have also been preserved  Jefferson kept a four page draft that late in life he called the  original Rough draught   How many drafts Jefferson wrote prior to this one  and how much of the text was contributed by other committee members  is unknown  In 1947  Boyd discovered a fragment of an earlier draft in Jefferson s handwriting  Jefferson and Adams sent copies of the rough draft  with slight variations  to friends   During the writing process  Jefferson showed the rough draft to Adams and Franklin  and perhaps other members of the drafting committee  who made a few more changes  Franklin  for example  may have been responsible for changing Jefferson s original phrase  We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable  to  We hold these truths to be self evident   Jefferson incorporated these changes into a copy that was submitted to Congress in the name of the committee  The copy that was submitted to Congress on June 28 has been lost  and was perhaps destroyed in the printing process  or destroyed during the debates in accordance with Congress s secrecy rule   9  Legacy  Having served its original purpose in announcing the independence of the United States  the Declaration was initially neglected in the years immediately following the American Revolution  Early celebrations of Independence Day  like early histories of the Revolution  largely ignored the Declaration  Although the act of declaring independence was considered important  the text announcing that act attracted little attention  The Declaration was rarely mentioned during the debates about the United States Constitution  and its language was not incorporated into that document  George Mason s draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights was more influential  and its language was echoed in state constitutions and state bills of rights more often than Jefferson s words   In none of these documents   wrote Pauline Maier   is there any evidence whatsoever that the Declaration of Independence lived in men s minds as a classic statement of American political principles    9 1  Influence in other countries  Many leaders of the French Revolution admired the Declaration of Independence but were also interested in the new American state constitutions  The inspiration and content of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen  1789  emerged largely from the ideals of the American Revolution  Its key drafts were prepared by Lafayette  working closely in Paris with his friend  Thomas Jefferson  It also borrowed language from George Mason s Virginia Declaration of Rights   According to historian David Armitage  the Declaration of Independence did prove to be internationally influential  but not as a statement of human rights  Armitage argued that the Declaration was the first in a new genre of declarations of independence that announced the creation of new states   Other French leaders were directly influenced by the text of the Declaration of Independence itself  The Manifesto of the Province of Flanders  1790  was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration  others include the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence  1811   the Liberian Declaration of Independence  1847   the declarations of secession by the Confederate States of America  1860–61   and the Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence  1945   These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state  without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original   Some other countries that used the Declaration as inspiration or directly copied sections from it is the Haitian declaration of 1 January 1804 from the Haitian Revolution  the United Provinces of New Granada in 1811  the Argentine Declaration of Independence in 1816  the Chilean Declaration of Independence in 1818  Costa Rica in 1821  El Salvador in 1821  Guatemala in 1821  Honduras in  1821   Mexico in 1821  Nicaragua in 1821  Peru in 1821  Bolivian War of

along with  the consent of the governed    9 2  Revival of interest  In the United States  interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s with the emergence of America s first political parties  Throughout the 1780s  few Americans knew  or cared  who wrote the Declaration  But in the next decade  Jeffersonian Republicans sought political advantage over their rival Federalists by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author  Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson s authorship or originality  and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress  with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee  Federalists insisted that Congress s act of declaring independence  in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role  was more important than the document announcing that act  But this view  like the Federalist Party  would fade away  and before long the act of declaring independence would become synonymous with the document   A less partisan appreciation for the Declaration emerged in the years following the War of 1812  thanks to a growing American nationalism and a renewed interest in the history of the Revolution  In 1817  Congress commissioned John Trumbull s famous painting of the signers  which was exhibited to large crowds before being installed in the Capitol  The earliest commemorative printings of the Declaration also appeared at this time  offering many Americans their first view of the signed document  Collective biographies of the signers were first published in the 1820s  giving birth to what Garry Wills called the  cult of the signers   In the years that followed  many stories about the writing and signing of the document would be published for the first time   When interest in the Declaration was revived  the sections that were most important in 1776—the announcement of the independence of the United States and the grievances against King George—were no longer relevant  But the second paragraph  with its talk of self evident truths and unalienable rights  were applicable long after the war had ended  Because the Constitution and the Bill of Rights lacked sweeping statements about rights and equality  advocates of marginalized groups turned to the Declaration for support  Starting in the 1820s  variations of the Declaration were issued to proclaim the rights of workers  farmers  women  and others  In 1848  for example  the Seneca Falls Convention  a meeting of women s rights advocates  declared that  all men and women are created equal    9 3  Slavery and the Declaration  The contradiction between the claim that  all men are created equal  and the existence of American slavery attracted comment when the Declaration was first published  As mentioned above  although Jefferson had included a paragraph in his initial draft that strongly indicted Britain s role in the slave trade  this was deleted from the final version  Jefferson himself was a prominent Virginia slave holder having owned hundreds of slaves  Referring to this seeming contradiction  English abolitionist Thomas Day wrote in a 1776 letter   If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature  it is an American patriot  signing resolutions of independency with the one hand  and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves   In the 19th century  the Declaration took on a special significance for the abolitionist movement  Historian Bertram Wyatt Brown wrote that  abolitionists tended to interpret the Declaration of Independence as a theological as well as a political document   Abolitionist leaders Benjamin Lundy and William Lloyd Garrison adopted the  twin rocks  of  the Bible and the Declaration of Independence  as the basis for their philosophies   As long as there remains a single copy of the Declaration of Independence  or of the Bible  in our land   wrote Garrison   we will not despair   For radical abolitionists like Garrison  the most important part of the Declaration was its assertion of the right of revolution  Garrison called for the destruction of the government under the Constitution  and the creation of a new state dedicated to the principles of the Declaration   The controversial question of whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration  The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration took place during the Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821  Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the Founding Fathers of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle  and so new slave states should not be added to the country  Proslavery Congressmen  led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina  argued that since the Declaration was not a part of the Constitution  it had no relevance to the question   With the antislavery movement gaining momentum  defenders of slavery such as John Randolph and John C  Calhoun found it necessary to argue that the Declaration s assertion that  all men are created equal  was false  or at least that it did not apply to black people  During the debate over the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1853  for example  Senator John Pettit of Indiana argued that  all men are created equal   rather than a  self evident truth   was a  self evident lie   Opponents of the Kansas–Nebraska Act  including Salmon P  Chase and Benjamin Wade  defended the Declaration and what they saw as its antislavery principles   9 4  Lincoln and the Declaration  The Declaration s relationship to slavery was taken up in 1854 by Abraham Lincoln  a little known former Congressman who idolized the Founding Fathers  Lincoln thought that the Declaration of Independence expressed the highest principles of the American Revolution  and that the Founding Fathers had tolerated slavery with the expectation that it would ultimately wither away  For the United States to legitimize the expansion of slavery in the Kansas Nebraska Act  thought Lincoln  was to repudiate the principles of the Revolution  In his October 1854 Peoria speech  Lincoln said   The meaning of the Declaration was a recurring topic in the famed debates between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas in 1858  Douglas argued that  all men are created equal  in the Declaration referred to white men only  The purpose of the Declaration  he said  had simply been to justify the independence of the United States  and not to proclaim the equality of any  inferior or degraded race   Lincoln  however  thought that the language of the Declaration was deliberately universal  setting a high moral standard for which the American republic should aspire   I had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere   he said  During the seventh and last joint debate with Steven Douglas at Alton  Illinois on 15 October 1858 Lincoln said about the declaration   According to Pauline Maier  Douglas s interpretation was more historically accurate  but Lincoln s view ultimately prevailed   In Lincoln s hands   wrote Maier   the Declaration of Independence became first and foremost a living document  with  a set of goals to be realized over time    Like Daniel Webster  James Wilson  and Joseph Story before him  Lincoln argued that the Declaration of Independence was a founding document of the United States  and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution  which had been ratified more than a decade after the Declaration  Although the Constitution did not use the word  equality   Lincoln believed that  all men are created equal  remained a part of the nation s founding principles  He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 Gettysburg Address   Four score and seven years ago  i e  in 1776  our fathers brought forth on this continent  a new nation  conceived in Liberty  and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal    Lincoln s view of the Declaration as a moral guide to interpreting the Constitution became influential   For most people now   wrote Garry Wills in 1992   the Declaration means what Lincoln told us it means  as a way of correcting the Constitution itself without overthrowing it   Admirers of Lincoln  such as Harry V  Jaffa  praised this development  Critics of Lincoln  notably Willmoore Kendall and Mel Bradford  argued that Lincoln dangerously expanded the scope of the national government  and violated states  rights  by reading the Declaration into the Constitution   9 5  Women s suffrage and the Declaration  In July 1848  the first Woman s Rights Convention  the Seneca Falls Convention  was held in Seneca Falls  New York  The convention was organized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton  Lucretia Mott  Mary Ann McClintock  and Jane Hunt  In their  Declaration of Sentiments   patterned on the Declaration of Independence  the convention members demanded social and political equality for women  Their motto was that  All men and women are created equal  and the convention demanded suffrage for women  The suffrage movement was supported by William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass   9 6  Legacy  The adoption of the Declaration of Independence was dramatized in the 1969 Tony Award winning musical play 1776  and the 1972 movie of the same name  as well as in the 2008 television miniseries John Adams   The engrossed copy of the Declaration is central to the 2004 Hollywood film National Treasure  in which the main character steals the document because he believes it has secret clues to a treasure hidden by some of the Founding Fathers   The Declaration is featured in The Probability Broach  1980   an alternative history novel  when one word is added to the document  to read that governments  derive their just power from the unanimous consent of the governed    In 1984 the Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence was dedicated in Constitution Gardens on the National Mall in Washington  D C   where the signatures of all the original signers are carved in stone with their names  places of residences and occupations   The Declaration document is at risk in Honour Among Thieves  1993   a novel by Jeffrey Archer in which Saddam Hussein tries to steal the Declaration to burn it publicly on July 4   10  References  11  Bibliography  Armitage  David    Cambridge  Massachusetts  Harvard University Press  2007  ISBN 978 0 674 02282 9   Bailyn
