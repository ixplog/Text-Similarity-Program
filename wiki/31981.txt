The USS Cole bombing was a suicide attack against the United States Navy guided missile destroyer on 12 October 2000  while it was harbored and being refueled in the Yemeni port of Aden  17 American sailors were killed  and 39 were injured  This event was the deadliest attack against a United States Naval vessel since 1987   The terrorist organization al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack  A U S  judge has held Sudan liable for the attack  while another has released over $13 million in Sudanese frozen assets to the relatives of those killed  The American Navy has reconsidered their rules of engagement in response to this attack   1  Attack  On the morning of Thursday  12 October 2000  USS Cole  under the command of Commander Kirk Lippold  docked in Aden harbor for a routine fuel stop  Cole completed mooring at 09 30  refueling started at 10 30  Around 11 18 local time  08 18 UTC   a small craft approached the port side of the destroyer  and an explosion occurred afterward  creating a 40 by 60 foot gash in the ship s port side  according to the memorial plate to those who lost their lives  Former CIA intelligence officer Robert Finke said the blast appeared to be caused by explosives molded into a shaped charge against the hull of the boat  Around 400 to 700 pounds  200â€“300 kg  of explosive were used  The blast hit the ship s galley  where crew were lining up for lunch  The crew fought flooding in the engineering spaces and had the damage under control after three days  Divers inspected the hull and determined that the keel was not damaged   17 sailors were killed and 39 were injured in the blast  The injured were taken to the United States Army s Landstuhl Regional Medical Center near Ramstein  Germany  before being sent to the United States  The attack was the deadliest against a U S  naval vessel since the Iraqi attack on the USS Stark on 17 May 1987  The asymmetric warfare attack was organized and directed by the terrorist organization al Qaeda  In June 2001  an al Qaeda recruitment video featuring Osama bin Laden boasted about the attack and encouraged similar attacks   Al Qaeda had previously attempted a similar but less publicized attack on the U S  Navy destroyer while in port at Aden on 3 January 2000  as a part of the 2000 millennium attack plots  The plan was to load a boat full of explosives and explode it near The Sullivans  However the boat was so overladen that it sank  forcing the attack to be abandoned   Planning for the attack was discussed at the Kuala Lumpur al Qaeda Summit shortly after the attempt  which was held from 5 to 8 January 2000  Along with other plotters  it was attended by future 11 September hijacker Khalid al Mihdhar  who then traveled to San Diego  California  where he established a close relationship with  9 11 imam  Anwar al Awlaki  who was later linked to numerous plots and attacks  including the Fort Hood shootings and the  underwear bomber  of 2009 and put on a targeted killing list by President Obama as a terrorist threat  On 10 June 2000  Mihdhar left San Diego to visit his wife in Yemen at a house also used as a communications hub for al Qaeda  After the bombing  Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul Karim al Iryani reported that Mihdhar had been one of the key planners of the attack and had been in the country at the time of the attacks  He would later return to the United States to participate in 9 11 on American Airlines Flight 77  which flew into the Pentagon  killing 184 people   1 1  Rescue  The first naval ship on the scene to assist the stricken Cole was the Royal Navy Type 23 frigate    under the command of Capt Anthony Rix  RN  She was on passage to the UK after a six month deployment in the Gulf  Marlborough had full medical and damage control teams on board and when her offer of assistance was accepted she immediately diverted to Aden  Eleven of the most badly injured sailors were sent via MEDEVAC to a French military hospital in Djibouti and underwent surgery before being sent to Germany   The first U S  military support to arrive was a Quick Response Force from the United States Air Force Security Forces  transported by C 130  They were followed by another small group of United States Marines from the Interim Marine Corps Security Force Company  Bahrain flown in by P 3  Both forces landed within a few hours after the ship was struck and were reinforced by a U S Marine platoon with the 2nd FAST Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team Company  FAST   based out of Yorktown  Virginia  The Marines from 4th Platoon  2nd FAST arrived on the 13th from a security mission in Qatar  The FAST platoon secured the USS Cole and a nearby hotel that was housing the U S  Ambassador to Yemen   and made best speed to arrive in the vicinity of Aden that afternoon providing repair and logistical support        and arrived in Aden some days later  providing watch relief crews  harbor security  damage control equipment  billeting  and food service for the crew of the Cole  LCU 1666 provided daily runs from the Tarawa with hot food and supplies and ferrying personnel to and from all other Naval vessels supporting USS Cole  In the remaining days LCU 1632 and various personnel from LCU 1666 teamed up to patrol around the Cole while the was preparing to take up station to receive the Cole   2  Investigation  In a form of transport pioneered in 1988 by the aboard the Mighty Servant 2  Cole was hauled from Aden aboard the Norwegian semi submersible heavy lift salvage ship   She arrived in Pascagoula  Mississippi  on 24 December 2000  where she was rebuilt   U S  FBI and NCIS agents sent to Yemen to investigate the bombing worked in an extremely hostile environment  They were met at the airport by Yemen special forces with  each soldier pointing an AK 47   Speakers in the Yemeni parliament  calling for jihad against America   were broadcast on local television each night  After some delay  Yemenis produced a CCTV video from a harborside security camera  but the crucial moment of the explosion was deleted   There were so many perceived threats that the agents often slept in their clothes and with their weapons at their sides   At one point  the hotel where the agents stayed  was surrounded with men in traditional dress  some in jeeps  all carrying guns   Finally the agents abandoned their hotel to stay at a Navy vessel in the Bay of Aden  but even that was not safe  After being granted  permission from the Yemeni government to fly back to shore   their helicopter  was painted by an SA 7 missile  and  had to take evasive maneuvers    3  Responsibility  On 14 March 2007  a federal judge in the United States  Robert G  Doumar  ruled that the Sudanese government was liable for the bombing   The ruling was issued in response to a lawsuit filed against the Sudanese government by relatives of the victims  who claim that al Qaeda could not have carried out the attacks without the support of Sudanese officials  The judge stated   There is substantial evidence in this case presented by the expert testimony that the government of Sudan induced the particular bombing of the Cole by virtue of prior actions of the government of Sudan   On 25 July 2007  Doumar ordered the Sudanese government to pay $8 million to the families of the 17 sailors who died  He calculated the amount they should receive by multiplying the salary of the sailors by the number of years they would have continued to work  Sudan s Justice Minister Mohammed al Mard has stated that Sudan intends to appeal the ruling   By May 2008  all defendants convicted in the attack had escaped from prison or been freed by Yemeni officials  However  on 30 June 2008  Brig  Gen  Thomas W  Hartmann  legal advisor to the U S  Military tribunal system  announced charges are being sworn against Abd al Rahim al Nashiri  a Saudi Arabian citizen of Yemeni descent  who has been held at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  since 2006  According to the Pentagon  the charges have been defined as  organizing and directing  the bombing of the USS Cole  The charges still must be approved by a Department of Defense official who oversees military commissions set up for terrorism suspects  The Pentagon will seek the death penalty   3 1  Alleged mastermind  Several individuals have been described as the USS Cole bombing mastermind   Among the allegations leveled by a Guantanamo Military Commission against Abd al Rahim al Nashiri  captured in late 2002  was that he was the mastermind of the USS Cole bombing  Al Nashiri was one of the three  high value detainees  the George W  Bush Presidency was to acknowledge had been subjected to waterboarding and other  extended interrogation techniques    Abu Ali al Harithi was one of the first suspected terrorists to be targeted by a missile armed predator drone  He too was described as the mastermind of the USS Cole bombing  In 2003  the U S  Justice Department indicted two people who were believed to been the last main co conspirators who were still at large  Jamal Ahmad Mohammad Al Badawi and Fahd al Quso   Jamal Ahmad Mohammad Al Badawi was convicted in Yemen  and sentenced to death  Fox News called Al Badawi a  mastermind  of the Cole bombing  Al Badawi was one of seventeen captives who escaped through a tunnel from a Yemeni jail in 2006   According to CNN  Tawfiq bin Attash  who was captured in Pakistan 2003 and is currently being held in U S  custody at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp  was  considered the mastermind  of the bombing  An Al Qaeda commander in Yemen also confirmed that another co conspirator in the bombing  Abdul Mun im Salim al Fatahani  was killed in a U S  drone strike on 31 January 2012  On 6 May 2012  officials from the Yemen government reported that al Quso was killed in an airstrike earlier in the day in southern Yemen  The report was later confirmed by U S  officials and Al Qaeda s media network As Sahab   4  Aftermath  4 1  Rules of engagement  The destroyer s rules of engagement  as approved by the Pentagon  kept its guards from firing upon the small boat  which was not known to be loaded with explosives  as it neared them without first obtaining permission from the Coles captain or another officer   Petty Officer John Washak said that right after the blast  a senior chief petty officer ordered him to turn an M 60 machine gun on the Coles fantail away from a second small boat approaching   With blood still on my face   he said  he was told   That s the rules of engagement  no shooting unless we re shot at   He added   In the military  it s like we re trained to hesitate now  If somebody had seen something wrong and shot  he probably would have been court martialed   Petty Officer Jennifer Kudrick said that if the sentries had fired on the suicide craft  we would have gotten in more trouble for shooting two foreigners than losing seventeen American sailors    4 2  Consequences  President Bill Clinton declared   If  as it now appears  this was an act of terrorism  it was a despicable and cowardly act  We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable    On 19 January 2001  the U S  Navy completed and released its Judge Advocate General Manual  JAGMAN  investigation of the incident  concluding that Coles commanding officer Commander Kirk Lippold  acted reasonably in adjusting his force protection posture based on his assessment of the situation that presented itself  when Cole arrived in Aden to refuel  The JAGMAN also concluded that  the commanding officer of Cole did not have the specific intelligence  focused training  appropriate equipment or on scene security support to effectively prevent or deter such a determined  preplanned assault on his ship  and recommended significant changes in Navy procedures  In spite of this finding  Lippold was subsequently denied promotion and retired at the same rank of commander in 2007   In Afghanistan the bombing was a  great victory for bin Laden  Al Qaeda camps   filled with new recruits  and contributors from the Gulf States arrived     with petrodollars    Both the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration have been criticized for failing to respond militarily to the attack on the USS Cole before 11 September 2001  The 9 11 Commission Report cites one source who said in February 2001    bin Laden  complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked  in response to the Cole     Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack  and if it did not he would launch something bigger    Evidence of al Qaeda s involvement was inconclusive for months after the attack  The staff of the 9 11 Commission found that al Qaeda s direction of the bombing was under investigation but  increasingly clear  on 11 November 2000  It was an  unproven assumption  in late November  By 21 December the CIA had made a  preliminary judgment  that  al Qaeda appeared to have supported the attack  without a  definitive conclusion    Accounts thereafter are varied and somewhat contradictory  Then National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice told the Commission that when the administration took office on 20 January 2001   We knew that there was speculation that the 2000 Cole attack was al Qaeda   We received  I think  on January 25 the same assessment  of al Qaeda responsibility   It was preliminary  It was not clear    The Washington Post reported that  on 9 February  Vice President Dick Cheney was briefed on bin Laden s responsibility  without hedge    Newsweek reported that on the following day   six days after Bush took office   the FBI  believed they had clear evidence tying the bombers to Al Qaeda    These conclusions are contrasted by testimony of key figures before the 9 11 Commission  summarized in the 9 11 Commission Report  Former CIA Director George Tenet testified  page 196  that he  believed he laid out what was knowable early in the investigation  and that this evidence never really changed until after 9 11   The report suggests  pages 201â€“202  that the official assessment was similarly vague until at least March 2001   On January 25  Tenet briefed the President on the Cole investigation  The written briefing repeated for top officials of the new administration what the CIA had told the Clinton White House in November  This included the  preliminary judgment  that al Qaeda was responsible  with the caveat that no evidence had yet been found that Bin Ladin himself ordered the attack    in March 2001  the CIA s briefing slides for Rice were still describing the CIA s  preliminary judgment  that a  strong circumstantial case  could be made against al Qaeda but noting that the CIA continued to lack  conclusive information on external command and control  of the attack  According to Rice  the decision not to respond militarily to the Cole bombing was President Bush s  She said he  made clear to us that he did not want to respond to al Qaeda one attack at a time  He told me he was  tired of swatting flies    The administration instead began work on a new strategy to eliminate al Qaeda  As a result of the USS Cole bombing  the U S  Navy began to reassess its anti terrorism and force protection methods  both at home and abroad  The Navy stepped up Random Anti Terrorism Measures  RAM   which are meant to complicate the planning of a terrorist contemplating an attack by making it difficult to discern a predictable pattern to security posture   In November 2001  the Navy opened an Anti Terrorism and Force Protection Warfare Center at Naval Amphibious Base  NAB  Little Creek  in Virginia Beach  Virginia  with the objective of developing tactics  equipment and training to combat terrorists   On 3 November 2002  the CIA fired an AGM 114 Hellfire missile from a Predator UAV at a vehicle in Yemen carrying Abu Ali al Harithi  a suspected planner of the bombing plot  Also in the vehicle was Ahmed Hijazi  a U S  citizen  Both were killed   On 29 September 2004  a Yemeni judge sentenced Abd al Rahim al Nashiri and Jamal al Badawi to death for their roles in the bombing  Al Nashiri  believed to be the operation s mastermind  was detained by the United States at Guantanamo Bay detention camp  Al Badawi  in Yemeni custody  denounced the verdict as  an American one   Four others were sentenced to prison terms of five to 10 years for their involvement  including one Yemeni who had videotaped the attack   In October 2004 the Navy consolidated the forces it deploys for anti terrorism and force protection under a single command at NAB Little Creek  The new Maritime Force Protection Command  MARFPCOM  was activated to oversee the administration and training of the expeditionary units the Navy deploys overseas to protect ships  aircraft and bases from terrorist attack  MARFPCOM aligned four existing components  the Mobile Security Forces  Naval Coastal Warfare  Explosive Ordnance Disposal  EOD   and Expeditionary Mobile Diving and Salvage Forces   On 3 February 2006  23 suspected or convicted Al Qaeda members escaped from jail in Yemen  This number included 13 who were convicted of the bombings of USS Cole and the French tanker Limburg in 2002  Among those who reportedly escaped was Al Badawi  Al Qaeda s Yemeni number two Abu Assem al Ahdal may also have escaped  On 17 October 2007  al Badawi surrendered to Yemeni authorities as part of an agreement with al Qaeda militants  Following his surrender  Yemeni authorities released him in return for a pledge not to engage in any violent or al Qaeda related activity  despite a US$5 million reward for his capture  Two other escapees remained at large   In June 2008 the United States charged Abd al Rahim al Nashiri with planning and conducting the attack  The US planned to seek the death penalty in his case  On 5 February 2009  the United States dropped all charges against al Nashiri  without prejudice  to comply with President Obama s order to shut down the military prison at Guantanamo Bay  but reserved the right to file charges at a later date  Charges were reinstated in 2011   In 2009  U S  federal judge Kimba Wood released $13 4 million in frozen assets belonging to Sudan to be awarded to 33 spouses  parents  and children of the sailors killed in the attack  The money was awarded based on the 2002 Terrorism Risk Insurance Act and spearheaded by Miami Attorney Andrew C  Hall  Previously  the court had found Sudan culpable in facilitating the attack on the destroyer  Said John Clodfelter  father of Kenneth Clodfelter who was killed in the bombing   It s about time something was done  It s taken so much more time than we thought it should take    The USS Cole bombing plays a highly visible role in Navy damage control training  which begins in boot camp with a pre graduation Battle Stations event   The Cole Scenario  launched in 2007 takes place aboard a realistic destroyer mock up housed at Naval Station Great Lakes  Illinois  The training focuses on preparing recruits for damage control challenges they may face in the fleet   5  Memorial  A memorial to the victims of the attack was dedicated at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia on 12 October 2001  It was erected along the shore of Willoughby Bay  and overlooks the channel used by Navy ships transiting to sea  Seventeen low level markers stand for the youthfulness of the sailors  whose lives were cut short  Three tall granite monoliths  each bearing brass plaques  stand for the three colors of the American flag  A set of brown markers encircling the memorial symbolize the darkness and despair that overcame the ship  In addition  28 black pine trees were planted to represent the 17 sailors and the 11 children they left behind   The memorial was funded by contributions from thousands of private individuals and businesses to the Navy Marine Corps Relief Society  which gave the memorial to the Navy  Its design originated as a vision of USS Cole crew members  who then teamed with Navy architects and the Society to finalize the project  The Cole memorial is located about 500 feet west of the Naval Station memorial for the USS Iowa turret explosion  There is also another memorial marker placed at Wisconsin Square in the city of Norfolk  near the    6  See also  Nasir Ahmad Nasir al Bahri
