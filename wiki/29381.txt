A semi trailer truck is a large vehicle that consists of a towing engine  known as a tractor in the United States and truck in many other places  attached to one or more semi trailers to carry freight  It is also known as a transport  truck  in Canada  semi or single in Australia  semi  tractor trailer  big rig  or eighteen wheeler in the United States  articulated lorry  abbreviated artic  in Britain and Ireland  and  lorry  in Malawi   A semi trailer does not trail completely behind the towing vehicle  but is attached at a point that is just forward of the rear most axle of the towing unit  This is done so that a large portion of the weight of the trailer is carried by the prime mover  This arrangement means that both tractor and semi trailer will have a distinctly different design than a rigid truck and trailer   1  Regional configurations  1 1  North America  In North America  the combination vehicles made up of a powered truck and one or more detachable trailers  are known as semi tractor trailers  tractor trailers  semis  big rigs  semi trucks or eighteen wheelers   1 1 1  Trucks  The tractors  or powered trucks  typically have two or three axles  those built for hauling heavy duty commercial construction machinery may have as many as four or five axles  some often being lift axles   The most common tractor cab layout has a forward engine  one steering axle  and two drive axles  The fifth wheel trailer coupling on most tractor trucks is movable fore and aft  to allow adjustment in the weight distribution over its rear axle s    Ubiquitous in Europe  but less common in North America since the 1990s  is the cabover configuration  where the driver sits next to  or over the engine  With changes in the US to the maximum length of the combined vehicle  the cabover was mostly phased out of North American over the road or long haul service by 2007  Cabovers were notorious for being difficult to service  as the cab could not be lifted on its hinges to a full 90 degree forward tilt  and this severely limited access to the front part of the engine   Trucks average between   with fuel economy standards requiring more than efficiency by 2014   1 1 2  Trailers  The cargo trailer usually has a tandem axle pair at the rear  each of which has dual wheels  or eight wheels on the trailer  four per axle  The combination of eight tires on the trailer and ten tires on the tractor is what led to the moniker eighteen wheeler  although this term is considered by some truckers to be a misnomer  Many trailers are equipped with movable tandem axles to allow adjusting the weight distribution   The United States also allows two axle tractors to pull two single axle semi trailers  known officially as STAA doubles  and colloquially as doubles  a set  or a set of joints  on all highways that are part of the national network   To connect the second of a set of doubles to the first trailer  and to support the front half of the second trailer  a converter gear  also known as a con gear or dolly is used  This apparatus has one or two axles  a fifth wheel coupling for the rear trailer  and a tongue with a ring hitch coupling for the forward trailer  Individual states may further allow longer vehicles  known as  longer combination vehicles   or LCVs   and may allow them to operate on roads other than those that are part of the national network   LCV types include   Triples  Three trailers  maximum weight up to    Turnpike Doubles  Two trailers  maximum weight up to  Rocky Mountain Doubles  One trailer  though usually no more than   and one trailer  known as a  pup    maximum weight up to  In Canada  a Turnpike Double is two trailers  and a Rocky Mountain Double is a trailer with a  pup   Future LCV s under consideration and study for the U S  MAP 21 transportation bill are container doubles  These combinations are under study for potential recommendation in November 2014   trailer Turnpike Doubles  GVWR  40 and 20 ft  12 and 6 1 m  trailer Rocky Mountain Doubles  GVWR  Double trailer Doubles  GVWR Regulations on LCVs vary widely from one state or province to another  None allows more than three trailers without a special permit  Reasons for limiting the legal trailer configurations include both safety concerns and the impracticality of designing and constructing roads that can accommodate the larger wheelbase of these vehicles and the larger minimum turning radii associated with them   Most states restrict operation of larger tandem trailer setups such as triple units  turnpike doubles and Rocky Mountain doubles  In general  these configurations are restricted to turnpikes  Except for these units  tandem setups are not restricted to certain roads any more than a single setup  They are also not restricted by weather conditions or  difficulty of operation   The Canadian province of Ontario  however  does have    In the United States  is the maximum allowable legal gross vehicle weight without a permit   The axle weight breakdown is   maximum on a single axle  maximum on the tandem axles Over length and overweight permits are issued by each individual state whose roads will be traveled  The permits are usually issued in advance  for a specific period of time  over a specific route  with a specific load  Most over length loads require one or more escort vehicles  An escort is an accompanying automobile and its driver  who communicates with the driver of the payload vehicle regarding the position of the load in relation to the road and shoulder  and about other situational considerations   A trailer s dimensions can vary greatly  depending on the amount and type of cargo it is designed to haul  In the United States  they are normally limited to in width   See types of trailers under Construction  below    1 2  Europe  The noticeable difference between tractor units in the North American and Europe is that almost all European models are cab over engine  COE or forward control   while the majority of North American trucks are conventional  or normal control   For repairs  the entire cab hinges forward to allow maintenance access  European trucks  whether rigid or fully articulated  have a sheer face on the front  This allows for shorter trucks with longer trailers  with larger freight capacity  within the legal maximum total length  Furthermore  it offers greater manoeuvrability and better overview for the driver  Conversely  conventional cab tractors offer the driver a more comfortable driving environment and better protection in a collision as well as eliminating the need to empty the driver s personal effects from the tractor whenever the engine requires service   In Europe usually only the rear tractor axle has twin wheels  while larger size single wheels are used for the cargo trailer  The most common combination used in Europe is a semi tractor with two axles and a cargo trailer with three axles  giving five axles and 12 wheels in total  Lesser used  common in Scandinavia  are tractors with three axles  which feature twin wheels either on one or both rear axles  In addition to the most common three axles variant  cargo trailers with only two or only one axle are in use  again usually with larger single wheels   In Sweden  lumber and long distance freight is run on seven or eight axle combinations up to in weight and long  Semi trailers are used for short distance freight  In Finland  since 1 October 2013  law allows 76 tonnes maximum if the truck has nine axles  and 68 tonnes maximum if the truck has eight axles  The truck can be 25 25 m long and high in both cases  The forest sector plans to submit to the Finnish Transport Safety Agency an application for testing lorries weighing 90 tonnes and long on Finnish roads   1 2 1  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom  the maximum permitted gross weight of a semi trailer truck  without the use of a Special Type General Order  STGO   is   which is the second heaviest permitted legal weight for a single semi trailer truck in the world   is allowed in the Netherlands   In order for a 44 tonne semi trailer truck to be permitted on UK roads the tractor and semi trailer must have three or more axles each  Lower weight semi trailer trucks can mean some tractors and trailer having fewer axles  In practice  like double decker buses and coaches in the UK  there is no legal height limit for semi trailer trucks  however  bridges over do not have the height marked on them  Semi trailer trucks on Continental Europe have a height limit of    Vehicles heavier than 44 000 kg are permitted on UK roads but are indivisible loads  which would be classed as abnormal  or oversize   Such vehicles are required to display an STGO  Special Types General Order  plate on the front of the tractor unit and  under certain circumstances  are required to travel by an authorised route and have an escort   Most UK trailers are long and  dependent on the position of the fifth wheel and kingpin  a coupled tractor unit and trailer will have a combined length of between   Although the Construction and Use Regulations allow a maximum rigid length of   this  combined with a shallow kingpin and fifth wheel set close to the rear of the tractor unit  can give an overall length of around   although combinations of this length are usually used only to carry steel or concrete beams  Providing certain requirements are fulfilled  a Special Types General Order  STGO  allows for vehicles of any size or weight to travel on UK roads  However  in practice any such vehicle has to travel by a route authorised by the Department of Transport and move under escort  The escort of abnormal loads in the UK is now predominantly carried out by private companies  but extremely large or heavy loads that require road closures must still be escorted by the police   In the UK  some articulated trucks have eight tyres on three axles on the tractor  these are known as six wheelers or  six leggers   with either the centre or rear axle having single wheels which normally steer as well as the front axle and can be raised when not needed  i e  when unloaded or only a light load is being carried  an arrangement known as a TAG axle when it is the rear axle  or mid lift when it is the centre axle   Some trailers have two axles which have twin wheels on each axle  other trailers have three axles  of which one axle can be a lift axle which has super single wheels  In the UK  two wheels bolted to the same hub are classed as a single wheel  therefore a standard six axle articulated truck is considered to have twelve wheels  even though it has twenty tyres  The UK also allows articulated truck tractors which have six tyres on two axles  these are known as four wheelers   1 2 1 1  Denby Eco Link B Train  In 2009  the operator Denby Transport designed and built a 25 25 metre long B Train  or B Double  semi trailer truck called the Denby Eco Link to show the benefits of such a vehicle  which were a reduction in road accidents and result in less road deaths  a reduction in emissions due to the one tractor unit still being used and no further highway investment being required  Furthermore  Denby Transport asserted that two Eco Links would replace three standard articulated lorries while  if limited to the current UK weight limit of 44 tonnes  it was claimed the Eco Link would reduce carbon emissions by 16% and could still halve the number of trips needed for the same amount of cargo carried in conventional lorries  This is based on the fact that for light but bulky goods such as toilet paper  plastic bottles  cereals and aluminium cans  conventional lorries run out of cargo space before they reach the weight limit  At 44 tonnes  as opposed to 60 tonnes usually associated with B Trains  the Eco Link also exerts less weight per axle on the road compared to the standard six axle 44 tonne articulated combination   The vehicle was built after Denby Transport believed they had found a legal loophole in the present UK law to allow the Eco Link to be used on the public roads  The relevant legislation concerned the 1986 Road Vehicles Construction and Use Regulations  The 1986 regulations state that  certain vehicles  may be permitted to draw more than one trailer and can be up to   The point of law reportedly hinged on the definition of a  towing implement   with Denby prepared to argue that the second trailer on the Eco Link was one  The Department for Transport were of the opinion that this refers to recovering a vehicle after an accident or breakdown  but the regulation does not explicitly state this   During BTAC performance testing the Eco Link was given an  excellent  rating for its performance in manoeuvrability  productivity  safety and emissions tests  superseding ordinary lorries in many respects  Private trials had also reportedly shown the Denby vehicle had a 20% shorter stopping distance than conventional lorries of the same weight  due to having extra axles  The active steer system meant that the Eco Link had a turning circle of   the same as a conventional articulated lorry   Although the DfT advised that the Eco Link was not permissible on public roads  Denby Transport gave the Police prior warning of the timing and route of the test drive on the public highway  as well as outlining their position in writing to the Eastern Traffic Area Office  On 1 December 2009 Denby Transport were preparing to drive the Eco Link on public roads  but this was cut short because the Police pulled the lorry over as it left the gates in order to test it for its legality  to investigate any    offences which may be found   The Police said the vehicle was unlawful due to its length and Denby Transport was served with a notice by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency  VOSA  inspector to remove the vehicle from the road for inspection  Having returned to the yard  Denby Transport was formally notified by Police and VOSA that the lorry could not be used  Neither the Eco Link  nor any other B Train  have since been permitted on UK roads  However  this prompted the Department for Transport to undertake a desk study in to semi trailer trucks  which has resulted in the longer semi trailer trial which commenced in 2012   1 2 1 2  Longer semi trailers  Starting in January 2012 the Department for Transport is conducting a trial of longer semi trailers  The trial involves 900 semi trailers of in length  i e  longer than the current maximum   and a further 900 semi trailers of in length  i e  longer   This will result in the total maximum length of the semi trailer truck being for trailers 14 6 m in length  and for trailers 15 65 m in length  The increase in length will not result in the 44 000 kg weight limit being exceeded and will allow some operators to approach the weight limit which may not have been previously possible due to the previous length of trailers  The trial will run for a maximum of 10 years   1 2 2  Continental Europe  The maximum overall length applying in the EU and EEA member states is with a maximum weight of 40 tonnes  or 44 tonnes if carrying an ISO container  However  rules limiting the semi trailers to and 18 75 m are met with trucks carrying a standardized body with one additional 7 82 m body on tow as a trailer  Since 1996  when Sweden and Finland formally won a final exemption from the European Economic Area rules with 60 tonne and combinations  all other member states gained the ability to adopt the same rules  In Italy the maximum permitted weight  unless exceptional transport is authorized  is 44 tonnes for any kind of combination with five axles or more   1 2 2 1  Effort to increase the maximum overall length  The 25 25 metre truck combinations were developed under the branding of EcoCombi which influenced the name of EuroCombi for an ongoing standardization effort where such truck combinations shall be legal to operate in all jurisdictions of the European Economic Area  With the 50% increase in cargo weight  the fuel efficiency increases with an average of 20% with a corresponding relative decrease in carbon emissions and with the added benefit of one third fewer trucks on the road  The 1996 EU regulation defines a Europe Module System  EMS  as it was implemented in Sweden  The wording of EMS combinations and EuroCombi are now used interchangeably to point to truck combinations as specified in the EU document  however apart from Sweden and Finland the EuroCombi is only allowed to operate on specific tracks in other EU member states   From 2006  25 25 m truck trailer combinations are to be allowed on restricted routes within Germany  following a similar  on going  trial in The Netherlands  Similarly  Denmark have allowed 25 25 m combinations on select routes  Like in Sweden and Finland  these vehicles in continental Europe will run a 60 tonne weight limit  Two types are to be used  1  a 26 tonne truck pulling a dolly and semi trailer  or 2  an articulated tractor unit pulling a B double  The UK government has so far decided not to have its own trial of these 60 tonne vehicles  but to keep an eye on the other countries  trials   When using a dolly  which generally has to be equipped with lights and a license plate  rigid trucks can be used to pull semi trailers  The dolly is equipped with a fifth wheel to which the trailer is coupled  Because the dolly attaches to a pintle hitch on the truck  manoeuvring a trailer hooked to a dolly is different from manoeuvring a fifth wheel trailer  Backing the vehicle requires same technique as backing an ordinary truck full trailer combination  though the dolly semi setup is probably longer  thus requiring more space for manoeuvring  The tractor semi trailer configuration is rarely used on timber trucks  since these will use the two big advantages of having the weight of the load on the drive wheels  and the loader crane used to lift the logs from the ground can be mounted on the rear of the truck behind the load  allowing a short  lightweight  crane to reach both ends of the vehicle without uncoupling  Also construction trucks are more often seen in a rigid + midaxle trailer configuration instead of the tractor semi trailer setup   1 2 3  Denmark  the Netherlands  Norway  Sweden and Finland  Denmark  the Netherlands and Norway all allow trucks  the Netherlands from 2000  Denmark from 2008  and Norway from 2008 on selected routes    In Sweden  the allowed length has been since 1967  Before that  the maximum length was unlimited  the only limitations were on axle load  What stopped Sweden from adopting the same rules as the rest of Europe  when securing road safety  was the national importance of a competitive forestry industry  Finland  with the same road safety issues and equally important forestry industry  followed suit  The change made trucks able to carry three stacks of cut to length logs instead of two  as it would be in a short combination  They have one on stack together with a crane on the 6×4 truck  and two additional stacks on a four axle trailer  The allowed gross weight in both countries is up to 60 tonnes depending on the distance between the first and last axle   In the negotiations starting in the late 1980s preceding the two countries  entries to the European Economic Area and later the European Union  they insisted on exemptions from the EU rules citing environmental concerns and the transportation needs of the logging industry  In 1995  after Sweden and Finland s entry to the union  the rules changed again  this time to allow trucks carrying a standard CEN unit of to draw a standard semi trailer on a dolly  a total overall length of 25 25 m  Later  B double combinations came into use  often with one container on the B link and a container  or two containers  on a semi trailer bed  In allowing the longer truck combinations  what would take two semi trailer trucks and one truck and trailer to haul on the continent now could be handled by just two 25 25 m trucks   greatly reducing overall costs and emissions  Prepared since late 2012 and effective on January 2013  Finland has changed its regulations to allow total maximum legal weight of a combination to be 76 tonnes  At the same time the maximum allowed height would be increased by   from current maximum of to   The effect this major maximum weight increase would cause to the roads and bridges in Finland over time is strongly debated   However  longer and heavier combinations are regularly seen on public roads  special permits are issued for special cargo  The mining company Boliden AB have a standing special permit for 80 tonne combinations on select routes between mines in the inland and the processing plant in Boliden  taking a 50 tonne load of ore  Volvo has a special permit for a   steering B trailer trailer combination carrying two containers to and from Gothenburg harbour and the Volvo Trucks factory  all on the island of Hisingen  Another example is the ongoing project En Trave Till  lit  One more pile stack  started in December 2008  It will allow even longer vehicles to further rationalize the logging transports  As the name of the project points out  it will be able to carry four stacks of timber  instead of the usual three  The test is limited to Norrbotten county and the European route E4 between the timber terminal in Överkalix and the sawmill in Munksund  outside Piteå   The vehicle is a long truck trailer combination with a gross weight exceeding 90 tonnes  It is estimated that this will give a 20% lower cost and 20 25% CO2 emissions reduction compared to the regular 60 tonne truck combinations  As the combinations spreads its weight over more axles  braking distance  road wear and traffic safety is believed to be either the same or improved with the 90 tonne truck trailer  In the same program two types of 74 tonne combinations will be tested in Dalsland and Bohuslän counties in western Sweden  an enhanced truck and trailer combination for use in the forest and a b double for plain highway transportation to the mill in Skoghall  In 2012  the Northland Mining company received permission for 90 tonne combinations with normal axle load  an extra dolly  for use on the Kaunisvaara Svappavaara route  carrying iron ore   1 3  Australia  Australian road transport has a reputation for using very large trucks and road trains  This is reflected in the most popular configurations of trucks generally having dual drive axles and three axles on the trailers  with four tires on each axle  This means that Australian single semi trailer trucks will usually have 22 wheels  which is generally more than their counterparts in other countries  Long haul transport usually operates as B doubles with two trailers  each with three axles   for a total of nine axles  including steering   In some lighter duty applications only one of the rear axles of the truck is driven  and the trailer may have only two axles   From July 2007  the Australian Federal and State Governments allowed the introduction of B triple trucks on a specified network of roads  B Triples are set up differently from conventional road trains  The front of their first trailer is supported by the turntable on the prime mover  The second and third trailers are supported by turntables on the trailers in front of them  As a result  B Triples are much more stable than road trains and handle exceptionally well  True road trains only operate in remote areas  regulated by each state or territory government   In total  the maximum length that any articulated vehicle may be  without a special permit and escort  is   its maximum load may be up to 164 tonnes gross  and may have up to four trailers  However  heavy restrictions apply to the areas where such a vehicle may travel in most states  In remote areas such as the Northern Territory great care must be taken when sharing the road with longer articulated vehicles that often travel during the day time  especially four trailer road trains   Articulated trucks towing a single trailer or two trailers  commonly known as  short doubles   with maximum overall length of are referred to as  General access heavy vehicles  and are permitted in all areas  including metropolitan  B doubles are limited to a maximum total weight of 62 5 tonnes and overall length of   or if they are fitted with approved FUPS  Front Underrun Protection System  devices  B doubles may only operate on designated roads  which includes most highways and some major metropolitan roads  B doubles are very common in all parts of Australia including state capitals and on major routes they outnumber single trailer configurations   Maximum width of any vehicle is and a height of   In the past few years  allowance has been made by several states to allow certain designs of heavy vehicles up to high but they are also restricted to designated routes  In effect  a 4 6 metre high B double will have to follow two sets of rules  they may access only those roads that are permitted for B doubles and for 4 6 metre high vehicles   In Australia  both conventional tractor units and cabovers are common  however cabovers are most often seen on B doubles on the eastern seaboard where the reduction in total length allows the vehicle to pull longer trailers and thus more cargo than it would otherwise   Super single tires are sometimes used on tri axle trailers  The suspension is designed with travel limiting  which will hold the rim off the road for one blown or deflated tire for each side of the trailer  so a trailer can be driven at reduced speed to a safe place for repair  Super singles are also often used on the steer axle in Australia to allow greater loading over the steer axle  The increase in loading of steer tires requires a permit   File B double logging truck in Australia jpg An Australian prime mover Kenworth and B

uncoupling  The cargo trailer is  by means of a king pin  hooked to a horseshoe shaped quick release coupling device called a fifth wheel or a turntable hitch at the rear of the towing engine that allows easy hook up and release  The truck trailer cannot move by itself because it only has wheels at the rear end  it requires a forward axle  provided by the towing engine  to carry half the load weight  When braking hard at high speeds  the vehicle has a tendency to fold at the pivot point between the towing vehicle and the trailer  Such a truck accident is called a  trailer swing   although it is also commonly described as a  jackknife   Jackknifing is a condition where the tractive unit swings round against the trailer  and not vice versa   2 3  Braking  Semi trucks use air pressure  rather than hydraulic fluid  to actuate the brakes mainly due to the much larger braking forces required  The use of air hoses allows for ease of coupling and uncoupling of trailers from the tractor unit  as well as reducing the potential for problems common to hydraulic systems  such as leakage or brake failure caused when overheated brake fluid vaporizes in the hydraulic lines  The most common failure is brake fade  usually caused when the drums or discs and the linings of the brakes overheat from excessive use   The parking brake of the tractor unit and the emergency brake of the trailer are spring brakes that require air pressure in order to be released  They are applied when air pressure is released from the system  and disengaged when air pressure is supplied  This is a fail safe design feature which ensures that if air pressure to either unit is lost  the vehicle will stop to a grinding halt  instead of continuing without brakes and becoming uncontrollable  The trailer controls are coupled to the tractor through two gladhand connectors  which provide air pressure  and an electrical cable  which provides power to the lights and any specialized features of the trailer   Glad hand connectors  also known as palm couplings  are air hose connectors  each of which has a flat engaging face and retaining tabs  The faces are placed together  and the units are rotated so that the tabs engage each other to hold the connectors together  This arrangement provides a secure connection  but allows the couplers to break away without damaging the equipment if they are pulled  as may happen when the tractor and trailer are separated without first uncoupling the air lines  These connectors are similar in design to the ones used for a similar purpose between railroad cars  Two air lines typically connect to the trailer unit  An emergency or main air supply line pressurizes the trailer s air tank and disengages the emergency brake  and a second service line controls the brake application during normal operation   In the UK  male female quick release connectors  red line or emergency   have a female on the truck and male on the trailer  but a yellow line or service has a male on the truck and female on the trailer  This avoids coupling errors  causing no brakes  plus the connections will not come apart if pulled by accident  The three electrical lines will fit one way around a primary black  a secondary green  and an ABS lead  all of which are collectively known as suzies or suzie coils   Another braking feature of semi trucks is engine braking  which could be either a compression brake  usually shortened to Jake brake  or exhaust brake or combination of both  However  the use of compression brake alone produces a loud and distinctive noise  and to control noise pollution  some local municipalities have prohibited or restricted the use of engine brake systems inside their jurisdictions  particularly in residential areas  The advantage to using engine braking instead of conventional brakes is that a truck can descend a long grade without overheating its wheel brakes  Some vehicles can also be equipped with hydraulic or electric retarders which have an advantage of near silent operation   2 4  Transmission  Because of the wide variety of loads the semi may carry  they usually have a manual transmission to allow the driver to have as much control as possible  However  all truck manufacturers now offer semi automatic transmissions  manual gearboxes with automated gear change   as well as automatic transmissions   Semi truck transmissions can have as few as three forward speeds or as many as 18 forward speeds  plus 2 reverse speeds   A large number of transmission ratios means the driver can operate the engine more efficiently  Modern on highway diesel engines are designed to provide maximum torque in a narrow RPM range  usually 1200 1500 RPM   having more gear ratios means the driver can hold the engine in its optimum range regardless of road speed  drive axle ratio must also be considered    A ten speed manual transmission  for example is controlled via a six slot H box pattern  similar to that in five speed cars — five forward and one reverse gear  Gears six to ten  and high speed reverse  are accessed by a Lo High range splitter  gears one to five are Lo range  gears six to ten are High range using the same shift pattern  A Super 10 transmission  by contrast  has no range splitter  it uses alternating  stick and button  shifting  stick shifts 1 3 5 7 9  button shifts 2 4 6 8 10   The 13   15   and 18 speed transmissions have the same basic shift pattern  but include a splitter button to enable additional ratios found in each range  Some transmissions may have 12 speeds   Another difference between semi trucks and cars is the way the clutch is set up  On an automobile  the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift  to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine  On a semi truck with constant mesh transmission  non synchronized   such as by the Eaton Roadranger series  not only is double clutching required  but a clutch brake is required as well  The clutch brake stops the rotation of the gears  and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary  The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop  when the truck is moving  the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes   2 5  Lights  An electrical connection is made between the tractor and the trailer through a cable often referred to as a pigtail  This cable is a bundle of wires in a single casing  Each wire controls one of the electrical circuits on the trailer  such as running lights  brake lights  turn signals  etc  A straight cable would break when the rig went around corners  so a coiled cable is used which retracts these coils when not under tension  It is these coils that cause the cable to look like a pigtail   In most countries a trailer or semi trailer must have minimum  2 rear lights  red   2 stop lights  red   2 turning lights  one for right and one for left  flashing  amber  red optional in North America   2 marking lights behind if wider than certain specifications  red  plus a group of 3 red lights in the middle in North America   2 marking lights front if wider than the truck or wider than certain specifications  white  amber in North America   2 6  Wheels and tires  Although dual wheels are the most common  use of two single  wider tires  known as super singles  on each axle is becoming popular among bulk cargo carriers and other weight sensitive operators  With increased efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  the use of the super single tire is gaining popularity  There are several advantages to this configuration  The first of these is that super singles reduce fuel consumption  In 1999  tests on an oval track showed a 10% fuel savings when super singles were used  These savings are realized because less energy is wasted flexing fewer tire sidewalls  Second  the lighter overall tire weight allows a truck to be loaded with more freight  The third advantage is that the single wheel encloses less of the brake unit  which allows faster cooling and reduces brake fade   One of the major disadvantages of the super singles is that they are currently not as widely available as a standard tire  In addition  if a tire should become deflated or be destroyed  there is not another tire attached to the same hub to maintain the dynamic stability of the vehicle  as would be the case with dual wheels  With dual wheels  the remaining tire may be overloaded  but it will typically allow the vehicle to be safely stopped or driven to a repair facility   2 7  Skirted trailers  An innovation rapidly growing in popularity is the skirted trailer  The space between the road and the bottom of the trailer frame was traditionally left open  until it was realized that the turbulent air swirling under the trailer is a major source of aerodynamic drag  Three split skirt concepts were verified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to provide fuel savings greater than 5%  and four split skirt concepts had EPA verified fuel savings between 4% and 5%   Skirted trailers are often combined with Underrun Protection Systems  underride guards   greatly improving safety for passenger vehicles sharing the road   2 8  Underride guard  Technically called a Rear Underrun Protection System  RUPS   this is a rigid assembly hanging down from the bottom rear of the trailer  which is intended to provide some protection for passenger cars which collide with the rear of the trailer  Public awareness of this safeguard was increased in the aftermath of the accident that killed actress Jayne Mansfield on 29 June 1967  when the car she was in hit the rear of a tractor trailer  causing fatal head trauma  After her grisly death  the NHTSA recommended requiring a rear underride guard  also known as a Mansfield bar  or an ICC bar  but the trucking industry has been slow to upgrade this safety feature   The bottom rear of the trailer is near head level for an adult seated in a car  and without the underride guard  the only protection for such an adult s head in a rear end collision would be the car s windshield  Because of the height mismatch between a passenger car bumper and the much higher height of the platform of a trailer  the car s protective crush zone becomes irrelevant and air bags are ineffective in protecting the car passengers  if the underride guard is missing or inadequate   In addition to rear underride guards  truck tractor cabs may be equipped with a Front Underrun Protection System  FUPS  at the front bumper of the truck  The safest tractor trailers are also equipped with side underride guards  also called Side Underrun Protection System  SUPS   These additional barriers prevent passenger cars from skidding underneath the trailer from the side  such as in an oblique or side collision  or if the trailer jackknifes across the road  In addition to safety benefits  these underride guards may improve fuel mileage by reducing air turbulence under the trailer at highway speeds   Another benefit of having a sturdy underride guard is that it may be secured to a loading dock with a hook to prevent trailer creep  a movement of the trailer away from the dock  which opens up a dangerous gap during loading or unloading operations   3  Driver s license  A special driver s license is required to operate various commercial vehicles   3 1  Canada  Regulations vary by province  A license to operate a vehicle with air

domestic or international transport infrastructure to support containerized cargo shipment   Various types of rail flat bed train cars are modified to hold the cargo trailer or container with wheels or without  This is called Intermodal or piggyback  The system allows the cargo to switch from highway to railway or vice versa with relative ease by using gantry cranes   The large trailers pulled by a tractor unit come in many styles  lengths  and shapes  Some common types are  vans  reefers  flatbeds  sidelifts and tankers  These trailers may be refrigerated  heated  ventilated  or pressurized  depending on climate and cargo  Some trailers have movable wheel axles that can be adjusted by moving them on a track underneath the trailer body and securing them in place with large pins  The purpose of this is to help adjust weight distribution over the various axles  to comply with local laws   5  Media  5 1  Television  NBC ran two popular TV series about truck drivers in the 1970s
