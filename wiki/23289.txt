Persistence of vision is the theory where an afterimage is thought to persist for approximately one twenty fifth of a second on the retina  and believed to be the explanation for motion perception  however it only explains why the black spaces that come between each  real  movie frame are not perceived  The true reason for motion perception is the phi phenomenon while the true reason for perception of continuous light is Flicker fusion   The theory of persistence of vision is the belief that human perception of motion  brain centered  is the result of persistence of vision  eye centered   The theory was disproved in 1912 by Wertheimer but persists in many citations in many classic and modern film theory texts  A more plausible theory to explain motion perception  at least on a descriptive level  are two distinct perceptual illusions  phi phenomenon and beta movement   A visual form of memory known as iconic memory has been described as the cause of this phenomenon  Although psychologists and physiologists have rejected the relevance of this theory to film viewership  film academics and theorists generally have not  Some scientists nowadays consider the entire theory a myth   In contrasting persistence of vision theory with phi phenomena  a critical part of understanding that emerges with these visual perception phenomena is that the eye is not a camera and does not see in frames per second  In other words vision is not as simple as light registering on a medium  since the brain has to make sense of the visual data the eye provides and construct a coherent picture of reality  Joseph Anderson and Barbara Fisher argue that the phi phenomena privileges a more constructionist approach to the cinema  David Bordwell  Noël Carroll  Kirsten Thompson   whereas the persistence of vision privileges a realist approach  André Bazin  Christian Metz  Jean Louis Baudry    The discovery of persistence of vision is attributed to the Roman poet Lucretius  although he only mentions it in connection with images seen in a dream  In the modern era  some stroboscopic experiments performed by Peter Mark Roget in 1824 were also cited as the basis for the theory   1  Film systems  Persistence of vision is still the accepted term for this phenomenon in the realm of cinema history and theory  In the early days of film innovation  it was scientifically determined that a frame rate of less than 16 frames per second  frame s  caused the mind to see flashing images  Audiences still interpret motion at rates as low as ten frames per second or slower  as in a flipbook   but the flicker caused by the shutter of a film projector is distracting below the 16 frame threshold   Modern theatrical film runs at 24 frames a second  This is the case for both physical film and digital cinema systems   It is important to distinguish between the frame rate and the flicker rate  which are not necessarily the same  In physical film systems  it is necessary to pull down the film frame  and this pulling down needs to be obscured by a shutter to avoid the appearance of blurring  therefore  there needs to be at least one flicker per frame in film  To reduce the appearance of flicker  virtually all modern projector shutters are designed to add additional flicker periods  typically doubling the flicker rate to 48 Hz  single bladed shutters make two rotations per frame 舑 double bladed shutters make one rotation per frame   which is less visible   Some three bladed projector shutters even triple it to 72 Hz    In digital film systems  the scan rate may be decoupled from the image update rate  In some systems  such as the Digital Light Processing  DLP  system  there is no flying spot or raster scan at all  so there is no flicker other than that generated by the temporal aliasing of the film image capture   The new film system MaxiVision 48 films at 48 frames per second  which  according to film critic Roger Ebert  offers even a strobeless tracking shot past picket fences  The lack of strobe  as opposed to flicker  is due to the higher sampling rate of the camera relative to the speed of movement of the image across the film plane  This ultra smooth imaging is called High motion   2  Computer monitors  Aside from some configurations used until the early 1990s  computer monitors do not use interlacing  They may sometimes be seen to flicker  often in a brightly lit room  and at close viewing distances  The greater flickering in close up viewing is due to more of the screen being in the viewer s peripheral vision  which has more sensitivity to flickering  Generally  a refresh rate of 85 Hz or above  as found in most modern CRT monitors  is sufficient to minimize flicker in close viewing  and all recent computer monitors are capable of at least that rate   Flat panel liquid crystal display  LCD  monitors do not suffer from flicker even if their refresh rate is 60 Hz or lower  This is because an LCD pixel generates a continuous stream of light as long as that part of the image is supposed to be lit  see also ghosting   With each scan  the monitor determines whether a pixel should be light or dark and changes the state of the pixel accordingly  In a CRT  by comparison  each pixel generates a temporary burst of light  then darkening  in each periodic scan  The monitor activates a phosphor on the screen during each scan if the pixel is supposed to be light  but the phosphor fades before the next scan   3  Cartoon animation  In drawn animation  moving characters are often shot  on twos   that is to say  one drawing is shown for every two frames of film  which usually runs at 24 frames per second   meaning there are only 12 drawings per second  Even though the image update rate is low  the fluidity is satisfactory for most subjects  However  when a character is required to perform a quick movement  it is usually necessary to revert to animating  on ones   as  twos  are too slow to convey the motion adequately  A blend of the two techniques keeps the eye fooled without unnecessary production cost   Animation for most  Saturday morning cartoons  is produced as cheaply as possible  and is most often shot on  threes   or even  fours   i e  three or four frames per drawing  This translates to only 8 or 6 drawings per second  respectively   4  Printed media  Flip books use this principle  If the book is flipped at a fast enough speed  the illusion of smooth motion is created   5  Sparkler s trail effect  The sparkler s trail effect occurs when one waves around a lit sparkler  creating a trail of light  Although it appears that this trail is created by the light left from the sparkler as it is waved through the air  there is  in fact  no light along this trail  The lighted trail is a creation of the mind  which retains a perception of the sparkler s light for a fraction of a second in sensory memory   6  Persistence of vision displays  A class of display device described as  POV  is one that composes an image by displaying one spatial portion at a time in rapid succession  for example  one column of pixels every few milliseconds   A two dimensional POV display is often accomplished by means of rapidly moving a single row of LEDs along a linear or circular path  The effect is that the image is perceived as a whole by the viewer as long as the entire path is completed during the visual persistence time of the human eye  A further effect is often to give the illusion of the image floating in mid air  A three dimensional POV display is often constructed using a 2D grid of LEDs which is swept or rotated through a volume  POV display devices can be used in combination with long camera exposures to produce light writing   7  See also
