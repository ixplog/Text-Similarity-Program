The 5th century is the time period from 401 to 500 in accordance with the Julian calendar in Anno Domini   Common Era   1  Overview  The 5th century is noted for being a time of repeated disaster and instability both internally and externally for the Western Roman Empire  which finally collapsed  and came to an end in AD 476  The west was ruled by a succession of weak emperors  and true power began to fall increasingly into the hands of powerful generals  Internal instability and the pressing military problem of foreign invaders resulted in the ransacking of Rome by a Visigoth army in 410  Some recovery took place during the following decades  but the Western Empire received another serious blow when a second barbarian group  the Vandals  occupied Carthage  capital of the extremely important province of Africa  Attempts to retake the province were interrupted by the invasion of the Huns under Attila  After Attila s defeat  both Eastern and Western empires joined forces for a final assault on Vandal North Africa  but this campaign was a spectacular failure   2  Events  399 – 412  The Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian sails through the Indian Ocean and travels throughout Sri
