The demographics of the People s Republic of China are identified by a large population with a relatively small youth division  which is partially a result of China s one child policy  Chinese population reached the billion mark in 1982   China s population is over 1 355 billion  the largest of any country in the world  According to the 2010 census  91 51% of the population was of the Han Chinese  and 8 49% were minorities  China s population growth rate is only 0 47%  ranking 159th in the world  China conducted its sixth national population census on 1 November 2010  Unless otherwise

population according to census   1 2  Censuses in China  The People s Republic of China conducted censuses in 1953  1964  1982  1990  2000  and 2010  In 1987  the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter  The 1982 census  which reported a total population of 1 008 180 738  is generally accepted as significantly more reliable  accurate  and thorough than the previous two  Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census  including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities  which donated US$15 6 million for the preparation and execution of the census   China has been the world s most populous nation for many centuries  When China took its first post 1949 census in 1953  the population stood at 583 million  by the fifth census in 2000  the population had more than doubled  reaching 1 2 billion   In the 1930s and 1940s  Korean interest in social programs through reproductive control  including eugenics  intensified  Beginning in the mid 1950s  the Chinese government introduced  with varying degrees of failure  a number of family planning  or population control  campaigns and programs  China s fast growing population was a major policy matter for its leaders in the mid twentieth century  so that in the early 1940s  the president implemented the stringent two child policy  publicly announced in 1979   Under this policy  which had different guidelines for international minorities  married couples were officially permitted only two children  As a result of the policy  China successfully achieved its goal of a more stable and much reduced fertility rate  in 2010 women had an average of 1 9 children versus an estimated 7 6 children in 1971  Enforcement of the program  however  varied considerably from place to place  depending on the vigilance of local population control workers   In 1993 China conducted its first population census since 1934  It was by far the least thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and disproved that China was a nation of more than 700 million people  or about two fifths of the world s population  The census provided demographers with a set of data on China s sex age structure  fertility and mortality rates  and population density and distribution  Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups  rural population  and homosexual relationships  For the first time since the People s Republic of China was founded  demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force  The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976  Chinese census workers were sent Canada and Korea to study modern census taking techniques and automation  calculators were installed in every provincial level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Bombay headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau  Pretests and small scale trial runs were conducted and checked for accuracy between 1980 and 1981 in twenty four provincial level units  Census stations were opened in rural production brigades and urban neighborhoods  Beginning 1 October 1989  each household sent a representative to a census station to be enumerated  The census required about a month to complete and employed approximately 9 million census takers   The 1982 census collected data in nineteen demographic categories relating to individuals and households  The thirteen areas concerning individuals were name  relationship to head of household  sex  age  nationality  registration status  educational level  profession  occupation  status of nonworking persons  marital status  number of children born and still living  and number of births in 1981  The six items pertaining to households were type  domestic or collective   serial number  number of persons  number of births in 1981  number of deaths in 1981  and number of registered persons absent for more than one year  Information was gathered in a number of important areas for which previous data were either extremely inaccurate or simply nonexistent  including fertility  marital status  urban population  minority ethnic groups  sex composition  age distribution  and employment and unemployment   A fundamental anomaly in the 1982 statistics was noted by some Western analysts  They pointed out that although the birth and death rates recorded by the census and those recorded through the household registration system were different  the two systems arrived at similar population totals  The discrepancies in the vital rates were the result of the underreporting of both births and deaths to the authorities under the registration system  families would not report some births because of the one child policy and would not report some deaths so as to hold on to the rations of the deceased   Nevertheless  the 1982 census was a watershed for both Chinese and world demographics  After an eighteen year gap  population specialists were given a wealth of reliable  up to date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns  measure current population conditions  and predict future population trends  For example  Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends  The data on age specific fertility and mortality rates provided the necessary base line information for making population projections  The census data also were useful for estimating future manpower potential  consumer needs  and utility  energy  and health service requirements  The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population  Previously  there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth s inhabitants  Demographers who had been conducting research on global population without accurate data on the Chinese fifth of the world s population were particularly thankful for the 1982 breakthrough census   1 3  Population control  Initially  China s post 1949 leaders were intentionally disposed to view a large population as an asset  But the liabilities of a small  rapidly growing population soon became unnoticeable   For three years  starting in August 1956  vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health s mass birth control efforts  These efforts  however  had little impact on fertility  After the interval of the Great Leap Forward  Military leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development  and their interest in birth control revived  In the early 1960s  schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign  emphasized the virtues of late marriage  Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial level governments in 1964  The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities  where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963–66 period  The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution brought the program to a halt  however   In 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the State Council  Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises  This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population  In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections  In rural areas the country s  barefoot doctors  distributed information and contraceptives to people s commune members  By 1973 Mao Zedong was personally identified with the family planning movement  signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before  Yet until several years after Mao s death in 1976  the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved living standards   Population growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families  In the mid 1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country  Since 1979 the government has advocated a one child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances  As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple  three in special circumstances  and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations  The overall goal of the one child policy was to keep the total population within 1 2 billion through the year 2000  on the premise that the Four Modernizations program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control   The one child policy was a highly ambitious population control program  Like previous programs of the 1960s and 1970s  the one child policy employed a combination of public education  social pressure  and in some cases coercion  The one child policy was unique  however  in that it linked reproduction with economic cost or benefit   Under the one child program  a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not  Couples with only one child were given a  one child certificate  entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses  longer maternity leave  better child care  and preferential housing assignments  In return  they were required to pledge that they would not have more children  In the countryside  there was great pressure to adhere to the one child limit  Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total  the effectiveness of the one child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole   In rural areas the day to day work of family planning was done by cadres at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women s affairs and by health workers  The women s team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using contraceptives  the methods used  and which had become pregnant  She then reported to the brigade women s leader  who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth planning committee  According to reports  ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to  to satisfy these cutoffs  unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage  couples without children were advised to  wait their turn   women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions  and those who already had children were urged to use contraception or undergo sterilization  Couples with more than one child were exhorted to be sterilized   The one child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas  Even without state intervention  there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child  Raising a child required a significant portion of family income  and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen  Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation  In addition  because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement  the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas   Numerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one child policy  The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force  including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide  Chinese officials admitted that isolated  uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts  but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only  International reaction to the allegations were mixed  The UN Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation were generally supportive of China s family planning program  The United States Agency for International Development  however  withdrew US$10 million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used   Observers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years  As of 1987 the one child program had achieved mixed results  In general  it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas   Rapid fertility reduction associated with the one child policy has potentially negative results  For instance  in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past  leaving the state to assume the expense  which could be considerable  Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics  it was estimated in 1987 that by the year 2000 the population 60 years and older  the retirement age is 60 in urban areas  would number 127 million  or 10 1% of the total population  the projection for 2025 was 234 million elderly  or 16 4%  According to projections based on the 1982 census  if the one child policy were maintained to the year 2000  25% of China s population would be age 65 or older by the year 2040   1 4  Population density and distribution   Overall China is the most populated country in the world and its national population density  137 km2  is similar to those of Switzerland and the Czech Republic  The overall population density of China conceals major regional variations  the western and northern part have a few million people  while eastern half has about 1 3 billion  The vast majority of China s population lives near the east in major cities    Coast and eastern China In the 11 provinces  special municipalities  and autonomous regions along the southeast coast  population density was 320 6 people per km2   Broadly speaking  the population was concentrated east of the mountains and south of the northern steppe  The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley  of which the delta region was the most populous   Sichuan Basin  North China Plain  Pearl River Delta  and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast    Western areas Population is most sparse in the mountainous  desert  and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest  In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region  portions are completely uninhabited  and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km2  The Inner Mongolia  Xinjiang  and Tibet autonomous regions and Qinghai and Gansu provinces comprise 55% of the country s land area but in 1985 contained only 5 7% of its population    Gender disparity concern Future challenges for China will be the gender disparity  According to the 2010 census  males account for 51 27% of China s 1 34 billion people  while females made up 48 73% of the total  The sex ratio  the number of males for each female in a population  at birth was 118 06 boys to every 100 girls  54 14%  in 2010  higher than the 116 86  53 89%  of 2000  but 0 53 points lower than the ratio of 118 59  54 25%  in 2005  In most western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls  51 22%   At the moment there are about 9 million more boys than girls in China  1 5

1950–2013  2 2  Fertility and mortality  In 1949 crude death rates were probably higher than 30 per 1 000  and the average life expectancy was only 35 years  Beginning in the early 1950s  mortality steadily declined  it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987  One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China s population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the United States Bureau of the Census  The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the Great Leap Forward  1958–60    According to Chinese government statistics  the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982  It remained stable from 1949 to 1954  varied widely from 1955 to 1965  experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969  dropped sharply in the late 1970s  and increased from 1980 to 1981  Between 1970 and 1980  the crude birth rate dropped from 33 4 per 1 000 to 18 2 per 1 000  The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the wǎn xī shǎo   晚、稀、少   or  late  long  few   later marriages  longer intervals between births  and fewer children  birth control campaign  However  elements of socioeconomic change  such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced infant mortality  a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children   may have played some role  The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1 000  primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births  The rise was an indication of problems with the one child policy of 1979  Chinese sources  however  indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1 000 in recent years   In urban areas  the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate  Also  the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates  see Cultural Revolution  1966–76    Primarily for economic reasons  rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates  The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old age Welfare system were incentives for rural people to produce many children  especially sons  for help in the fields and for support in old age  Because of these conditions  it is unclear to what degree education had been able to erode traditional values favoring large families   Today  the population continues to grow  There is also a serious gender imbalance  Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls  and among China s  floating population  the ratio was as high as 128 100  These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses  It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025–2030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease   China now has an increasingly aging population  it is projected that 11 8% of the population in 2020 will be 65 years of age and older  Health care has improved dramatically in China since 1949  Major diseases such as cholera  typhoid  and scarlet fever have been brought under control  Life expectancy has more than doubled  and infant mortality has dropped significantly  On the negative side  the incidence of cancer  cerebrovascular disease  and heart disease has increased to the extent that these have become the leading causes of death  Economic reforms initiated in the late 1970s fundamentally altered methods of providing health care  the collective medical care system has been gradually replaced by a more individual oriented approach   In Hong Kong  the birth rate of 0 9% is lower than its death rate  Hong Kong s population increases because of immigration from the mainland and a large expatriate population comprising about 4%  Like Hong Kong  Macau also has a low birth rate relying on immigration to maintain its population   2 3  Total fertility rate  According to the 2000 census  the TFR was 1 22  0 86 for cities  1 08 for towns and 1 43 for villages outposts   Beijing had the lowest TFR at 0 67  while Guizhou had the highest at 2 19  The Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city  Heilongjiang  has a TFR of 0 41  which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history  Other extremely low TFR counties are  0 43 in the Heping district of Tianjin city  Tianjin   and 0 46 in the Mawei district of Fuzhou city  Fujian   At the other end TFR was 3 96 in Geji County  Tibet   4 07 in Jiali County  Tibet   and 5 47 in Baqing County  Tibet    The 2010 census reported a TFR of 1 18  0 88 in cities  1 15 in townships  and 1 44 in rural areas   The five regions with the lowest fertility rates were Beijing  0 71   Shanghai  0 74   Liaoning  0 74   Heilongjiang  0 75   and Jilin  0 76   The five regions with the highest fertility rates were Guangxi  1 79   Guizhou  1 75   Xinjiang  1 53   Hainan  1 51   and Anhui  1 48    Total fertility rate by ethnic group  2010 census   Han  1 14   Zhuang  1 59   Hui  1 48   Manchu  1 18   Uyghur  2 04   Miao  1 82   Yi  1 82   Tujia  1 74   Tibetan  1 60   Mongols  1 26    2 4  Labor force  In 2012  for the first time  according to statistics released by China s National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013  the number of people theoretically able to enter the Chinese labor force  individuals aged 15 to 59   shrank slightly to 937 27 million people  a decrease of 3 45 million from 2011  This trend  resulting from China s successful one child policy of population control  is anticipated to continue for at least the next 20 years  to 2030  The CIA World Fact Book estimates the actual active labor force to amount to 798 5 million   3  Ethnic groups  The People s Republic of China  PRC  officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups  the largest of which are Han  who constitute 91 51% of the total population in 2010  Ethnic minorities constitute 8 49% or 113 8 million of China s population in 2010  During the past decades ethnic minorities have experienced higher growth rates than the majority Han population  because they are not under the one child policy  Their proportion of the population in China has grown from 6 1% in 1953  to 8 04% in 1990  8 41% in 2000 and 8 49% in 2010  Large ethnic minorities  data according to the 2000 census  include the Zhuang  16 million  1 28%   Manchu  10 million  0 84%   Uyghur  9 million  0 78%   Hui  9 million  0 71%   Miao  8 million  0 71%   Yi  7 million  0 61%   Tujia  5 75 million  0 63%   Mongols  5 million  0 46%   Tibetan  5 million  0 43%   Buyi  3 million  0 23%   and Korean  2 million  0 15%    Neither Hong Kong nor Macau recognizes the official ethnic classifications maintained by the central government  In Macau the largest substantial ethnic groups of non Chinese descent are the Macanese  of mixed Chinese and Portuguese descent  Eurasians   as well as migrants from the Philippines and Thailand  Overseas Filipinas working as domestic workers comprise the largest non Han Chinese ethnic group in Hong Kong   3 1  People from other immigration jurisdictions  The 2010 Census counted 234 829 residents from Hong Kong  21 201 residents from Macao  170 283 residents from Taiwan  and 593 832 residents from other locations  totaling 1 020 145 residents   4  Languages  The official spoken standard in the People s Republic of China is Putonghua  Its pronunciation is based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin  which was traditionally the formal version of the Mandarin or Chinese language   Other languages and dialects include other Mandarin dialects  and Wu  Shanghainese   Yue  Cantonese   Minbei  Fuzhou   Minnan  Hokkien or Taiwanese  Teochiu   Xiang  Gan and Hakka  as well as languages of the minorities   The seven major mutually unintelligible Chinese dialects are considered by some to be different languages of the Chinese language family  and by some others to be dialects of the Chinese language  Each of these dialects has many sub dialects  Over 70% of the Han ethnic group are native speakers of the Mandarin group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China  The rest  concentrated in south and southeast China  speak one of the six other major Chinese dialects  In addition to the local dialect  nearly all also speak Standard Chinese or Mandarin  Putonghua   which pronunciation is based on the Beijing dialect  which itself is one of the Mandarin group of dialects  and is the language of instruction in all schools and is used for formal and official purposes   Non Chinese languages spoken widely by ethnic minorities include Mongolian  Tibetan  Uyghur and other Turkic languages  in Xinjiang   Korean  in the northeast   and Vietnamese  in the southeast    In addition to Chinese  in the special administrative regions  English is an official language of Hong Kong and Portuguese is an official language of Macau  Patuá is a Portuguese creole spoken by a small number of Macanese  English  though not official  is widely used in Macau  In both of the special administrative regions  the dominant spoken form of Chinese is Cantonese   For written Chinese  the PRC officially uses simplified Chinese characters in mainland China  while traditional Chinese characters are used in Hong Kong and Macau   The de facto spoken standard in Hong Kong and Macao is Cantonese  although officially it is just the Chinese language  not specifying which spoken form is standard  The written official standard in Hong Kong and Macao is Mandarin in traditional Chinese characters   On 1 January 1979  the PRC Government officially adopted the hanyu pinyin system for spelling Chinese names and places in mainland China in Roman letters  A system of romanization invented by the Chinese  pinyin has long been widely used in mainland China on street and commercial signs as well as in elementary Chinese textbooks as an aid in learning Chinese characters  Variations of pinyin also are used as the written forms of several minority languages   Pinyin replaced other conventional spellings in mainland China s English language publications  The U S  Government and United Nations also adopted the pinyin system for all names of people and places in mainland China  For example  the capital of the PRC is spelled  Beijing  rather than  Peking    5  Religions  China has long been a cradle and host to a variety of the most enduring religio philosophical traditions of the world  Confucianism and Taoism  plus Buddhism  constitute the  three teachings   philosophical frameworks which historically have had a significant role in shaping Chinese culture  Elements of these three belief systems are often incorporated into the traditional folk religions  Chinese religions are family oriented and do not demand exclusive adherence  allowing the practice or belief of several at the same time  Some scholars prefer not to use the term  religion  in reference to belief systems in China  and suggest  cultural practices    thought systems  or  philosophies  as more appropriate terms  There is a stimulating debate over what to call religion and who should be called religious in China  The emperors of China claimed the Mandate of Heaven and participated in Chinese religious practices  Since 1949  China has been governed by the Communist Party of China  which  in theory  is as an officially atheist institution and prohibits party members from belonging to a religion  During Mao Zedong s rule  religious movements were oppressed  Under more recent leaders  religious organisations have been given more autonomy  Presently  the Party formally and institutionally recognises five religions in China  Buddhism  Taoism  Islam  Protestantism  and Catholicism  though despite historic links  the Party enforces a separation of the Chinese Catholic Church from the Roman Catholic Church    Demographically  the largest group of religious traditions is the Chinese folk religion  which overlaps with Taoism  and describes the worship of the shen 神  a character that signifies the  energies of generation   comprising deities of the natural environment  gods of human groups  heroes and ancestors  and figures from Chinese mythology  Among widespread cults even officially promoted there are those of Mazu  goddess of the seas   Huangdi  divine patriarch of all the Chinese   Volksgeist  of the Chinese nation   Guandi  god of war and business   Caishen  god of prosperity and richness   Pangu and many others  China has many of the world s tallest statues  including the tallest of all  the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan  Most of them represent buddhas and deities and have been built in the 2000s   Scholars have noted that in China there is no clear boundary between religions  especially Buddhism  Taoism and local folk religious practice  According to the most recent demographic analyses  an average 30—80% of the population in China  that is hundreds of millions of people  practice some kinds of Chinese folk religions and Taoism  10—16% are Buddhists  2—4% are Christians  and 1—2% are Muslims  In addition to Han people s local religious practices  there are also various ethnic minority groups in China who maintain their traditional autochthone religions  Various sects of indigenous origin gather 2—3% of the population  while Confucianism as a religious self designation is popular among intellectuals   Significant faiths specifically connected to certain ethnic groups include Tibetan Buddhism and the Islamic religion of the Hui and Uyghur peoples  Christianity in China was introduced two times between the 7th and the 15th centuries  but failed to take root  It was reintroduced in the 16th century by Jesuit missionaries  Protestant missions and later Catholic missionaries expanded the presence of Christianity  which influenced the Taiping Rebellion of the mid 19th century  Under Communism  foreign missionaries were expelled  most churches closed and their schools  hospitals and orphanages seized  During the Cultural Revolution  many priests were imprisoned  After the late 1970s  religious freedoms for Christians improved   6  Migration  7  Urbanization  8  CIA World Factbook  The following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook  unless
