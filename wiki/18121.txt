Leg spin is a type of Spin bowling in the sport of cricket  A leg spinner bowls right arm with a wrist spin action  causing the ball to spin from right to left in the cricket pitch  at the point of delivery  When the ball bounces  the spin causes the ball to deviate sharply from right to left  that is  away from the leg side of a right handed batsman  The same kind of trajectory  which spins from right to left on pitching  when performed by a left arm bowler is known as left arm orthodox spin bowling   As with all spinners  leg spinners bowl the ball far slower  70â€“90 km h or 45 55 mph  than fast bowlers  The fastest leg spinners will sometimes top 100 km h  60 mph   Leg spinners typically use variations of flight by sometimes looping the ball in the air  allowing any cross breeze and the aerodynamic effects of the spinning ball to cause the ball to dip and drift before bouncing and spinning  usually called  turning   sharply  While very difficult to bowl accurately  good leg spin is considered one of the most threatening types of bowling to bat against  since the flight and sharp turn make the ball s movement extremely hard to read and the turn away from the batsman  assuming he or she is right handed  is more dangerous than the turn into the batsman generated by an off spinner   Highly skilled leg spin bowlers are also able to bowl deliveries that behave unexpectedly  including the googly  which turns the opposite way to a normal leg break and the topspinner  which does not turn but dips sharply and bounces higher than other deliveries  A few leg spinners such as Abdul Qadir  Anil Kumble  Shane Warne and Mushtaq Ahmed have also mastered the flipper  a delivery that like a topspinner goes straight on landing  but floats through the air before skidding and keeping low  often dismissing batsmen leg before wicket or bowled  Another variation in the arsenal of some leg spinners is the slider  a leg break pushed out of the hand somewhat faster  so that it doesn t spin as much  but travels more straight on   To grip the ball for a leg spinning delivery  the ball is placed into the palm with the seam parallel to the palm  The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball  and the third and fourth fingers close together and rest against the side of the ball  The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam  The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler  but should impart no pressure  When the ball is bowled  the third finger will apply most of the spin  The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip  and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released  adding more spin  The ball is tossed up to provide flight  The batsman will see the hand with the palm facing towards them when the ball is released   1  History  In the 1970s and 1980s it was thought that leg spin would disappear from the game due to the success of West Indian and later Australian teams exclusively using fast bowlers  During this time Abdul Qadir of Pakistan was the highest profile leg spinner in the world and is sometimes credited with  keeping the art alive   However  leg spin has again become popular with cricket fans and a successful part of cricket teams  driven largely by the success of Shane Warne  beginning with his spectacular Ball of the Century to Mike Gatting in 1993   2  Notable Players  Players listed below have been included as they meet specific criteria which the general cricketing public would recognise as having achieved significant success in the art of leg spin bowling  For example  leading wicket takers  and inventors of new deliveries   Bernard Bosanquet   credited with inventing the googly  B  S  Chandrasekhar   took 5 wickets in an innings on 16 occasions  Clarrie Grimmett   216 Test wickets  world record 1936 53  Anil Kumble   619 Test wickets  3rd all time   BBI* 10 74  Abdul Qadir   took 10 wickets in a match on 5 occasions  Shane Warne   708 Test wickets  2nd all time   one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Century Note  * BBI   Best Bowling in an Innings  3  References
