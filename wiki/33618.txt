William Paley  July 1743 – 25 May 1805  was an English clergyman  Christian apologist  philosopher  and utilitarian  He is best known for his natural theology exposition of the teleological argument for the existence of God in his work Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity  which made use of the watchmaker analogy   1  Life  Paley was born in Peterborough  England  and was educated at Giggleswick School  of which his father was headmaster  and at Christ s College  Cambridge  He graduated in 1763 as senior wrangler  became fellow in 1766  and in 1768 tutor of his college  He lectured on Samuel Clarke  Joseph Butler and John Locke in his systematic course on moral philosophy  which subsequently formed the basis of his Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy  and on the New Testament  his own copy of which is in the British Library  The subscription controversy was then agitating the university  and Paley pushed an anonymous defence of a pamphlet in which the Master of Peterhouse and Bishop of Carlisle Edmund Law had advocated the retrenchment and simplification of the Thirty nine Articles  he did not  however  sign the petition  called the  Feathers Tavern  petition  from the place where it was agreed  for a relaxation of the terms of subscription  He was also a strong supporter of the American colonies during the revolutionary war  partly because he thought it would lead to the destruction of slavery  He studied philosophy   In 1776 Paley was presented to the rectory of Musgrave in Westmorland  which was exchanged soon after for Appleby  He was subsequently made vicar of Dalston in 1780  near the bishop s palace at Rose Castle  In 1782 he became the Archdeacon of Carlisle  Paley was intimate with the Law family throughout his life  and the Bishop and his son John Law  who was later an Irish bishop  were instrumental during the decade after he left Cambridge in pressing him to publish his revised lectures and in negotiating with the publisher  In 1782 Edmund Law  otherwise the mildest of men  was most particular that Paley should add a book on political philosophy to the moral philosophy  which Paley was reluctant to write  The book was published in 1785 under the title of The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy  and was made a part of the examinations at the University of Cambridge the next year  It passed through fifteen editions in the author s lifetime  Paley strenuously supported the abolition of the slave trade  and his attack on slavery in the book was instrumental in drawing greater public attention to the evil trade  In 1789  a speech he gave on the subject in Carlisle was published   The Principles was followed in 1790 by his first essay in the field of Christian apologetics  Horae Paulinae  or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul which compared the Paul s epistles with the Acts of the Apostles  making use of  undesigned coincidences  to argue that these documents mutually supported each other s authenticity  Some have said this book was the most original of Paley s works  It was followed in 1794 by the celebrated View of the Evidences of Christianity  which was also added to the examinations at Cambridge  remaining on the syllabus until the 1920s   For his services in defence of the faith  with the publication of the Evidences  the Bishop of London gave him a stall in St Paul s  the Bishop of Lincoln made him subdean of that cathedral  and the Bishop of Durham conferred upon him the rectory of Bishopwearmouth  During the remainder of Paley s life  his time was divided between Bishopwearmouth and Lincoln  during which time he wrote Natural Theology  or  Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity  despite his increasingly debilitating illness  He died on 25 May 1805 and is buried in Carlisle Cathedral with his two wives   2  Thought  Paley s Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy was one of the most influential philosophical texts in late Enlightenment Britain  It was cited in several parliamentary debates over the corn laws in Britain and in debates in the US Congress  The book remained a set textbook at Cambridge well into the Victorian era  Even Charles Darwin was required to read it when he studied at Christ s College  But it was Paley s Natural Theology that most impressed Darwin  even though it was not a set book for undergraduates   Paley is also remembered for his contributions to the philosophy of religion  utilitarian ethics and Christian apologetics  In 1802  he published Natural Theology  or  Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity  his last book  As he states in the preface  he saw the book as a preamble to his other philosophical and theological books  in fact  he suggests that Natural Theology should be read first  so as to build a systematic understanding of his arguments  The main thrust of his argument was that God s design of the whole creation could be seen in the general happiness  or well being  that was evident in the physical and social order of things  Such a book fell within the broad tradition of natural theology works written during the Enlightenment  and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on John Ray  1691   William Derham  1711  and Bernard Nieuwentyt  1750    Paley s argument is built mainly around anatomy and natural history   For my part   he says   I take my stand in human anatomy   elsewhere he insists upon  the necessity  in each particular case  of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear   In making his argument  Paley employed a wide variety of metaphors and analogies  Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world  Historians  philosophers and theologians often call this the Watchmaker analogy  Building on this mechanical analogy  Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock  To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend John Law and the Dublin Astronomer Royal John Brinkley   The germ of the idea is to be found in ancient writers who used sundials and Ptolemaic epicycles to illustrate the divine order of the world  These types of examples can be seen in the work of the ancient philosopher Cicero  especially in his De natura deorum  ii  87 and 97  The watch analogy was widely used in the Enlightenment  by deists and Christians alike  Thus  Paley s use of the watch  and other mechanical objects like it  continued a long and fruitful tradition of analogical reasoning that was well received by those who read Natural Theology when it was published in 1802   3  Legacy  Since Paley is often read in university courses that address the philosophy of religion  the timing of his design argument has sometimes perplexed modern philosophers  Earlier in the century David Hume had argued against notions of design with counter examples drawn from monstrosity  imperfect forms of testimony and probability  Hume s arguments  however  were not widely accepted by most of the reading public and they fell  stillborn   to use Hume s own assessment  from the press  Despite Hume s unpopularity  Paley s published works and in manuscript letters show that he engaged directly with Hume from his time as an undergraduate to his last works  Paley s works were more influential than Hume s from the 1800s to the 1840s  Hume s arguments were only accepted gradually by the reading public  and his philosophical works sold poorly until agnostics like T H Huxley championed Hume s philosophy in the late 19th century   Scientific norms have changed greatly since Paley s day  and are inclined to do less than justice to his arguments and ways of reasoning  But his style is lucid and he was willing to present transparently the evidence against his own case  His subject matter was central to Victorian anxieties  which might be one reason Natural Theology continued to appeal to the reading public  making his book a best seller for most of the 19th century  even after the publication of Darwin s Origin of Species in 1859  Natural Theology and the Evidences of Christianity appealed to Victorian Evangelicals  although not so much to adherents of the Oxford Movement – and both found his utilitarianism objectionable  Paley s views influenced  both positively and negatively  theologians  philosophers and scientists  then and since   In addition to Moral and Political Philosophy and the Evidences  Charles Darwin read Natural Theology during his student years  and later stated in his autobiography that he was initially convinced by the argument  His views changed with time  By the 1820s and 1830s  well known liberals like Thomas Wakley and other radical editors of The Lancet were using Paley s ageing examples to attack the establishment s control over medical and scientific education in Durham  London  Oxford and Cambridge  It also inspired the Earl of Bridgewater to commission the Bridgewater Treatises and the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge to issue cheap reprints for the rising middle class  But whereas Paley s natural theology was disassembled or rebuilt by intellectuals like Wakley or the Bridgewater authors  the core of argument retained an ongoing popularity with the reading public and served as the basis of many catechisms and textbooks that were used in Britain and its colonies until World Word II when  as argued by Matthew Daniel Eddy  the existential morass of World War I undermined the moral teleology that had underpinned natural theology since the Enlightenment   Today  Paley s name evokes both reverence and revulsion and his work is cited accordingly by authors seeking to frame their own views of design  Even Richard Dawkins  an opponent of the design argument  described himself as a neo Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker  Today  as in his own time  though for different reasons   Paley is a controversial figure  a lightning rod for both sides in the contemporary argument between science and religion  His writings reflect the thought of his time  but as Dawkins observed  his was a strong and logical approach to evidence  whether human or natural  Perhaps this explains why the Oxford constitutional theorist A V  Dicey had his pupils read the Evidences to teach them about legal reasoning  It is for such reasons that Paley s writings  Natural Theology included  stand as a notable body of work in the canon of Western thought   4  Works  The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy  1785  Horae Paulinae  or the
