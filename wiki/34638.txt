In the United States  a 401 k  plan is the tax qualified  defined contribution pension account defined in subsection 401 k  of the Internal Revenue Code  Under the plan  retirement savings contributions are provided  and sometimes proportionately matched  by an employer  deducted from the employee s paycheck before taxation  therefore tax deferred until withdrawn after retirement or as otherwise permitted by applicable law   and limited to a maximum pre tax annual contribution of $18 000  as of 2015    Other employer provided defined contribution plans include 403 b  plans  for nonprofit institutions  and 457 b  plans for governmental employers  These plans are all established under section 401 a  of the Internal Revenue Code  401 a  plans may provide total annual addition of $52 000  as of 2014  per plan participant  including both employee and employer contributions   1  History  The section of the Internal Revenue Code that made 401 k  plans possible was enacted into law in 1978  It was intended to allow taxpayers a break on taxes on deferred income  In 1980  a benefits consultant named Ted Benna took note of the previously obscure provision and figured out that it could be used to create a simple  tax advantaged way to save for retirement  The client he was working for at the time chose not to create a 401 k  plan  He later went on to install the first 401 k  plan at his own employer  The Johnson Companies  today doing business as Johnson Kendall & Johnson    2  Tax consequences  With either pre tax or after tax contributions  earnings from investments in a 401 k  account  in the form of interest  dividends  or capital gains  are tax deferred  The resulting compounding interest with delayed taxation is a major benefit of the 401 k  plan when held over long periods of time  Beginning in the 2006 tax year  employees have been allowed to designate contributions as a Roth 401 k  deduction  Similar to the provisions of a Roth IRA  these contributions are made on an after tax basis and all earnings   For pre tax contributions  the employee does not pay federal income tax on the amount of current income he or she defers to a 401 k  account  but does still pay the total 7 65% payroll taxes  social security and medicare   For example  a worker who otherwise earns $50 000 in a particular year and defers $3 000 into a 401 k  account that year only recognizes $47 000 in income on that year s tax return  Currently this would represent a near $750 term saving in taxes for a single worker  assuming the worker remained in the 25% marginal tax bracket and there were no other adjustments  e g   deductions   The employee ultimately pays taxes on the money as he or she withdraws the funds  generally during retirement  The character of any gains  including tax favored capital gains  is transformed into  ordinary income  at the time the money is withdrawn   If the employee made after tax contributions to the non Roth 401 k  account  these amounts are commingled with the pre tax funds and simply add to the non Roth 401 k  basis  When distributions are made the taxable portion of the distribution will be calculated as the ratio of the non Roth contributions to the total 401 k  basis  The remainder of the distribution is tax free and not included in gross income for the year   For accumulated after tax contributions and earnings in a designated Roth account  Roth 401 k     qualified distributions  can be made tax free  To qualify  distributions must be made more than 5 years after the first designated Roth contributions and not before the year in which the account owner turns age 59½  unless an exception applies as detailed in IRS code section 72 t   In the case of designated Roth contributions  the contributions being made on an after tax basis means that the taxable income in the year of contribution is not decreased as it is with pre tax contributions  Roth contributions are irrevocable and cannot be converted to pre tax contributions at a later date   In contrast to Roth individual retirement accounts  IRAs   where Roth contributions may be re characterized as pre tax contributions   Administratively  Roth contributions must be made to a separate account  and records must be kept that distinguish the amount of contribution and the corresponding earnings that are to receive Roth treatment   Unlike the Roth IRA  there is no upper income limit capping eligibility for Roth 401 k  contributions  Individuals who find themselves disqualified from a Roth IRA may contribute to their Roth 401 k   Individuals who qualify for both can contribute the maximum statutory amounts into either or a combination of the two plans  including both catch up contributions if applicable   Aggregate statutory annual limits set by the IRS will apply   3  Withdrawal of funds  The Internal Revenue Code imposes severe restrictions on withdrawals of pre tax or Roth contributions while a person remains in service with the company and is under the age of 59½  Any withdrawal that is permitted before the age of 59½ is subject to an excise tax equal to ten percent of the amount distributed  on top of the ordinary income tax that has to be paid   including withdrawals to pay expenses due to a hardship  except to the extent the distribution does not exceed the amount allowable as a deduction under Internal Revenue Code section 213 to the employee for amounts paid during the taxable year for medical care  determined without regard to whether the employee itemizes deductions for such taxable year    In any event any amounts are subject to normal taxation as ordinary income  The Internal Revenue Code generally defines hardship for this purpose as  Unreimbursed medical expenses for the participant  the participant s spouse or dependent   Purchase of an employee s principal residence   Payment of college tuition and related educational costs such as room and board for the next 12 months for the participant  the participant s spouse or dependents  or children who are no longer dependents   Payments necessary to prevent eviction from the participant s home  or foreclosure on the mortgage of a principal residence   For funeral expenses   Certain expenses for the repair of damage to the employee s principal residence  Some employers may disallow one  several  or all of the previous hardship causes  Someone wishing to withdraw from such a 401 k  plan would have to resign from their employer  To maintain the tax advantage for income deferred into a 401 k   the law stipulates the restriction that unless an exception applies  money must be kept in the plan or an equivalent tax deferred plan until the employee reaches 59½ years of age  Money that is withdrawn prior to the age of 59½ typically incurs a 10% penalty tax unless a further exception applies  This penalty is on top of the  ordinary income  tax that has to be paid on such a withdrawal  The exceptions to the 10% penalty include  the employee s death  the employee s total and permanent disability  separation from service in or after the year the employee reached age 55  substantially equal periodic payments under section 72 t   a qualified domestic relations order  and for deductible medical expenses  exceeding the 7 5% floor   This does not apply to the similar 457 plan   Many plans also allow employees to take loans from their 401 k  to be repaid with after tax funds at pre defined interest rates  The interest proceeds then become part of the 401 k  balance  The loan itself is not taxable income nor subject to the 10% penalty as long as it is paid back in accordance with section 72 p  of the Internal Revenue Code  This section requires  among other things  that the loan be for a term no longer than 5 years  except for the purchase of a primary residence   that a  reasonable  rate of interest be charged  and that substantially equal payments  with payments made at least every calendar quarter  be made over the life of the loan  Employers  of course  have the option to make their plan s loan provisions more restrictive  When an employee does not make payments in accordance with the plan or IRS regulations  the outstanding loan balance will be declared in  default   A defaulted loan  and possibly accrued interest on the loan balance  becomes a taxable distribution to the employee in the year of default with all the same tax penalties and implications of a withdrawal   These loans have been described as tax disadvantaged  on the theory that the 401 k  contains before tax dollars  but the loan is repaid with after tax dollars  While this is precisely correct  the analysis is fundamentally flawed with regard to the loan principal amounts  From your perspective as the borrower  this is identical to a standard loan where you are not taxed when you get the loan  but you have to pay it back with taxed dollars  However  the interest portion of the loan repayments  which are essentially additional contributions to the 401 k   are made with after tax funds but they do not increase the after tax basis in the 401 k   Therefore  upon distribution conversion of those funds the owner will have to pay taxes on those funds a second time   3 1  Required minimum distributions  RMD   Account owners must begin making distributions from their accounts by April 1 of the calendar year after turning age 70½ or April 1 of the calendar year after retiring  whichever is later  The amount of distributions is based on life expectancy according to the relevant factors from the appropriate IRS tables  There is an exception to minimum distribution for people still working once they reach that age  The exception only applies to the current plan they are participating in and does not apply if the account owner is a 5% owner of the business sponsoring the retirement plan  Required minimum distributions apply to both pretax and after tax Roth contributions  Only a Roth IRA is not subject to minimum distribution rules  Other than the exception for continuing to work after age 70½ differs from the rules for IRA minimum distributions  The same penalty applies to the failure to make the minimum distribution  The penalty is 50% of the amount that should have been distributed  one of the most severe penalties the IRS applies  In response to the economic crisis  Congress suspended the RMD requirement for 2009   3 2  Force out  Former employees   terminated participants   can have their 401 k  accounts closed if their account balances are low  such a provision in the plan is referred to as a  force out  provision  Almost 90% of plans have a force out provision  As of March 2005  the limit for force out provisions is a balance of $1 000—participants whose balance is over $1 000 cannot have their account closed  Before March 2005  the limit was $5 000   Closing an account requires that the participant either roll over the funds to an IRA  another 401 k  plan or take a distribution   cash out    85% of those with balances of under $1 000 cash out  either voluntarily or due to a force out provision   4  Rollovers  Rollovers between eligible retirement plans are accomplished in one of two ways  by a distribution to the participant and a subsequent rollover to another plan or by a direct rollover from plan to plan  Rollovers after a distribution to the participant must generally be accomplished within 60 days of the distribution  If the 60 day limit is not met  the rollover will be disallowed and the distribution will be taxed as ordinary income and the 10% penalty will apply  if applicable  The same rules and restrictions apply to rollovers from plans to IRAs   4 1  Direct rollovers  A direct rollover from an eligible retirement plan to another eligible retirement plan is not taxable  regardless of the age of the participant   4 2  Traditional to Roth rollovers  In 2013 the IRS began allowing conversions of existing Traditional 401 k  contributions to Roth 401 k   In order to do so  an employee s company plan must offer both a Traditional and Roth option and explicitly permit such a conversion   5  Technical details  5 1  Contribution deferral limits  There is a maximum limit on the total yearly employee pre tax or Roth salary deferral into the plan  This limit  known as the  402 g  limit   was $15 500 for the year 2008  $16 500 for 2009–2011  $17 000 for 2012  $17 500 for 2013 2014 and $18 000 for 2015  For future years  the limit may be indexed for inflation  increasing in increments of $500  Employees who are 50 years old or over at any time during the year are now allowed additional pre tax  catch up  contributions of up to $5 000 for 2008  $5 500 for 2009–2014 and $6 000 for 2015  The limit for future  catch up  contributions may also be adjusted for inflation in increments of $500  In eligible plans  employees can elect to contribute on a pre tax basis or as a Roth 401 k  contribution  or a combination of the two  but the total of those two contributions amounts must not exceed the contribution limit in a single calendar year  This limit does not apply to post tax non Roth elections   If the employee contributes more than the maximum pre tax Roth limit to 401 k  accounts in a given year  the excess as well as the deemed earnings for those contributions must be withdrawn or corrected by April 15 of the following year  This violation most commonly occurs when a person switches employers mid year and the latest employer does not know to enforce the contribution limits on behalf of their employee  If this violation is noticed too late  the employee will not only be required to pay tax on the excess contribution amount the year was earned  the tax will effectively be doubled as the late corrective distribution is required to be reported again as income along with the earnings on such excess in the year the late correction is made   Plans which are set up under section 401 k  can also have employer contributions that cannot exceed other regulatory limits  Employer matching contributions can be made on behalf of designated Roth contributions  but the employer match must be made on a pre tax basis   Some plans also have a profit sharing provision where employers make additional contributions to the account and may or may not require matching contributions by the employee  These additional contributions may or may not require a matching employee contribution to earn them  These profit sharing contributions plus the matching contributions both cannot exceed 25% of the employee s pre tax compensation  As with the matching funds  these contributions are also made on a pre tax basis   There is also a maximum 401 k  contribution limit that applies to all employee and employer 401 k  contributions in a calendar year  This limit is the section 415 limit  which is the lesser of 100% of the employee s total pre tax compensation or $44 000 for 2006  $45 000 for 2007  $46 000 for 2008  $49 000 for 2009–2011  $50 000 for 2012  $51 000 for 2013  and $52 000 for 2014  For employees over 50  the catch up contribution limit is also added to the 415 limit   Governmental employers in the US  that is  federal  state  county  and city governments  are currently barred from offering 401 k  plans unless they were established before May 1986  Governmental organizations instead can set up a section 457 b    5 2  Contribution deadline  For a corporation  or LLC taxed as a corporation  contributions must be made by the end of a calendar year  For a sole proprietorship  partnership  or an LLC taxed as a sole proprietorship  the deadline for depositing contributions is generally the personal tax filing deadline  April 15  or September 15 if an extension was filed    5 3  Highly compensated employees  HCE   To help ensure that companies extend their 401 k  plans to low paid employees  an IRS rule limits the maximum deferral by the company s highly compensated employees  HCEs  based on the average deferral by the company s non highly compensated employees  NHCEs   If the less compensated employees save more for retirement  then the HCEs are allowed to save more for retirement  This provision is enforced via  non discrimination testing   Non discrimination testing takes the deferral rates of HCEs and compares them to NHCEs  An HCE in 2008 is defined as an employee with compensation of greater than $100 000 in 2007 or an employee that owned more than 5% of the business at any time during the year or the preceding year  In addition to the $100 000 limit for determining HCEs  employers can elect to limit the top paid group of employees to the top 20% of employees ranked by compensation  That is for plans whose first day of the plan year is in calendar year 2007  we look to each employee s prior year gross compensation  also known as  Medicare wages   and those who earned more than $100 000 are HCEs  Most testing done now in 2009 will be for the 2008 plan year and compare employees  2007 plan year gross compensation to the $100 000 threshold for 2007 to determine who is HCE and who is a NHCE  The threshold was $110 000 in 2010 and it did not change for 2011  For 2012 2013 and 2014  the threshold was increased from $110 000 to $115 000   The average deferral percentage  ADP  of all HCEs  as a group  can be no more than 2 percentage points greater  or 125% of  whichever is more  than the NHCEs  as a group  This is known as the ADP test  When a plan fails the ADP test  it essentially has two options to come into compliance  It can have a return of excess done to the HCEs to bring their ADP to a lower  passing  level  Or it can process a  qualified non elective contribution   QNEC  to some or all of the NHCEs to raise their ADP to a passing level  The return of excess requires the plan to send a taxable distribution to the HCEs  or reclassify regular contributions as catch up contributions subject to the annual catch up limit for those HCEs over 50  by March 15 of the year following the failed test  A QNEC must be an immediately vested contribution   The annual contribution percentage  ACP  test is similarly performed but also includes employer matching and employee after tax contributions  ACPs do not use the simple 2% threshold  and include other provisions which can allow the plan to  shift  excess passing rates from the ADP over to the ACP  A failed ACP test is likewise addressed through return of excess  or a QNEC or qualified match  QMAC    There are a number of  safe harbor  provisions that can allow a company to be exempted from the ADP test  This includes making a  safe harbor  employer contribution to employees  accounts  Safe harbor contributions can take the form of a match  generally totaling 4% of pay  or a non elective profit sharing  totaling 3% of pay   Safe harbor 401 k  contributions must be 100% vested at all times with immediate eligibility for employees  There are other administrative requirements within the safe harbor  such as requiring the employer to notify all eligible employees of the opportunity to participate in the plan  and restricting the employer from suspending participants for any reason other than due to a hardship withdrawal   5 4  Automatic enrollment  Employers are allowed to automatically enroll their employees in 401 k  plans  requiring employees to actively opt out if they do not want to participate  traditionally  401 k s required employees to opt in   Companies offering such automatic 401 k s must choose a default investment fund and savings rate  Employees who are enrolled automatically will become investors in the default fund at the default rate  although they may select different funds and rates if they choose  or even opt out completely   Automatic 401 k s are designed to encourage high participation rates among employees  Therefore  employers can attempt to enroll non participants as often as once per year  requiring those non participants to opt out each time if they do not want to participate  Employers can also choose to escalate participants  default contribution rate  encouraging them to save more   The Pension Protection Act of 2006 made automatic enrollment a safer option for employers  Prior to the Pension Protection Act  employers were held responsible for investment losses as a result of such automatic enrollments  The Pension Protection Act established a safe harbor for employers in the form of a  Qualified Default Investment Alternative   an investment plan that  if chosen by the employer as the default plan for automatically enrolled participants  relieves the employer of financial liability  Under Department of Labor regulations  three main types of investments qualify as QDIAs  lifecycle funds  balanced funds  and managed accounts  QDIAs provide sponsors with fiduciary relief similar to the relief that applies when participants affirmatively elect their investments   5 5  Fees  401 k  plans charge fees for administrative services  investment management services  and sometime outside consulting services  They can be charged to the employer  the plan participants or to the plan itself and the fees can be allocated on a per participant basis  per plan  or as a percentage of the plan s assets  For 2011  the average total administrative and management fees on a 401 k  plan was 0 78 percent or approximately $250 per participant   6  Plans for certain small businesses or sole proprietorships  The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001  EGTRRA  made 401 k  plans more beneficial to the self employed  The two key changes enacted related to the allowable  Employer  deductible contribution  and the  Individual  IRC 415 contribution limit   Prior to EGTRRA  the maximum tax deductible contribution to a 401 k  plan was 15% of eligible pay  reduced by the amount of salary deferrals   Without EGTRRA  an incorporated business person taking $100 000 in salary would have been limited in Y2004 to a maximum contribution of $15 000  EGTRRA raised the deductible limit to 25% of eligible pay without reduction for salary deferrals  Therefore  that same businessperson in Y2008 can make an  elective deferral  of $15 500 plus a profit sharing contribution of $25 000  i e  25%   and—if this person is over age 50—make a catch up contribution of $5 000 for a total of $45 500  For those eligible to make  catch up  contribution  and with salary of $122 000 or higher  the maximum possible total contribution in 2008 would be $51 000  To take advantage of these higher contributions  many vendors now offer Solo 401 k  plans or Individual k  plans  which can be administered as a Self Directed 401 k   allowing for investment into real estate  mortgage notes  tax liens  private companies  and virtually any other investment   Note  an unincorporated business person is subject to slightly different calculation  The government mandates calculation of profit sharing contribution as 25% of net self employment  Schedule C  income  Thus on $100 000 of self employment income  the contribution would be 20% of the gross self employment income  25% of the net after the contribution of $20 000   6 1  Rollovers as business start ups  ROBS   ROBS is an arrangement in which prospective business owners use their 401 k  retirement funds to pay for new business start up costs  ROBS is an acronym from the United States Internal Revenue Service for the IRS ROBS Rollovers as Business Start Ups Compliance Project   ROBS plans  while not considered an abusive tax avoidance transaction  are questionable because they may solely benefit one individual – the individual who rolls over his or her existing retirement 401 k  withdrawal funds to the ROBS plan in a tax free transaction  The ROBS plan then uses the rollover assets to purchase the stock of the new business  A C corporation must be set up in order to roll the 401 k  withdrawal   7  Other countries  Even though the term  401 k   is a reference to a specific provision of the U S  Internal Revenue Code section 401  it has become so well known that it has been used elsewhere as a generic term to describe analogous legislation  For example  in October 2001  Japan adopted legislation allowing the creation of  Japan version 401 k   accounts even though no provision of the relevant Japanese codes is in fact called  section 401 k     The term is not used in the UK  where analogous pension arrangements are known as personal pension schemes   8  Risk  Unlike defined benefit ERISA plans or banking institution savings accounts  there is no government insurance for assets held in 401 k  accounts  Plans of sponsors experiencing financial difficulties  sometimes have funding problems  Fortunately  the bankruptcy laws give a high priority to sponsor funding liability  In moving between jobs  this should be a consideration by a plan participant in whether to leave assets in the old plan or roll over the assets to a new employer plan or to an individual retirement arrangement  an IRA   Fees charged by IRA providers can be substantially less than fees charged by employer plans and typically offer a far wider selection of investment vehicles than employer plans   9  See also  Australia s superannuation system  Belgium s pensioensparen  Brazil s and Portugal s Fundo de pensão  Canada s Registered Retirement Savings Plan  France s special
