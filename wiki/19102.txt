The economy of Malawi is predominantly agricultural  with about 90% of the population living in rural areas  The landlocked country in south central Africa ranks among the world s least developed countries  Agriculture accounts for 37% of GDP and 85% of export revenues  The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF  the World Bank  and individual donor nations  The government faces strong challenges  to spur exports  to improve educational and health facilities  to face up to environmental problems of deforestation and erosion  and to deal with the rapidly growing problem of HIV AIDS in Africa   Malawi was ranked the 118th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings   1  Agriculture  Agriculture represents 37% of GDP  accounts for over 80% of the labor force  and represents about 80% of all exports  Its most important export crop is tobacco  which accounts for about 70% of export revenues  In 2000 the country was the tenth largest producer in the world  See table   The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates the following production of unprocessed tobacco by country in 2009  figures are in thousands of tonnes    The country s heavy reliance on tobacco places a heavy burden on the economy as world prices decline and the international community increases pressure to limit tobacco production  Malawi s dependence on tobacco is growing  with the product jumping from 53% to 70% of export revenues between 2007 and 2008   The country also relies heavily on tea  sugarcane and coffee  with these three plus tobacco making up more than 90% of Malawi s export revenue  Tea was first introduced in 1878  Most of it is grown in Mulanje and Thyolo  Other crops include cotton  corn  potatoes  sorghum  cattle and goats  Tobacco and sugar processing are notable secondary industries   Traditionally Malawi has been self sufficient in its staple food  maize  corn   and during the 1980s it exported substantial quantities to its drought stricken neighbors  Nearly 90% of the population engages in subsistence farming  Smallholder farmers produce a variety of crops  including maize  beans  rice  cassava  tobacco  and groundnuts  peanuts   Financial wealth is generally concentrated in the hands of a small elite  Malawi s manufacturing industries are situated around the city of Blantyre   Malawi has few exploitable mineral resources  Malawi s economic reliance on the export of agricultural commodities renders it particularly vulnerable to external shocks such as declining terms of trade and drought  High transport costs  which can comprise over 30% of its total import bill  constitute a serious impediment to economic development and trade  Malawi must import all its fuel products  Other challenges include a paucity of skilled labor  difficulty in obtaining expatriate employment permits  bureaucratic red tape  corruption  and inadequate and deteriorating road  electricity  water  and telecommunications infrastructure which hinder economic development in Malawi  However  recent government initiatives targeting improvements in the road infrastructure  together with private sector participation in railroad and telecommunications  have begun to render the investment environment more attractive   The following are Malawi s top 20

great demand on the local market  These are Pharmanova Ltd  and its sister company SADM  Malawi Pharmacies  Pharmaceuticals Limited  and Kentam Products Limited   2  International support  Malawi has undertaken economic structural adjustment programs supported by the World Bank  IBRD   the International Monetary Fund  IMF   and other donors since 1981  Broad reform objectives include stimulation of private sector activity and participation through the elimination of price controls and industrial licensing  liberalization of trade and foreign exchange  rationalization of taxes  privatization of state owned enterprises  and civil service reform  Malawi qualified for Heavily Indebted Poor Country  HIPC  debt relief and is in the process of refining its Poverty Reduction Strategy   Real GDP grew by 3 6% in 1999 and 2 1% in 2000  The government s monetary policy has been expansionary  and the average annual inflation has hovered around 30% in 2000 and 2001  keeping discount and commercial bank rates high  the discount rate was 47% in December 2000   In the second half of 2001  the Kwacha strengthened sharply against the U S  dollar  moving from 80 to 60   Malawi has bilateral trade agreements with its two major trading partners  South Africa and Zimbabwe  both of which allow duty free entry of Malawian products into their countries  The government faces challenges such as the improvement of Malawi s educational and health facilities—particularly important because of the rising rates of HIV AIDS—and environmental problems including deforestation  erosion  and overworked soils   2 1  Move towards economic independence  In 2006  in response to disastrously low agricultural harvests  Malawi  through an initiative by the late President Bingu Mutharika an economist by profession  began a program of fertilizer subsidies that were designed to re energize the land and boost crop production  It has been reported that this program  championed by the country s president  is radically improving Malawi s agriculture  and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries   Economic grievances though took a downward slide during Mutharikas second term  Economic grivences was a catalyst that resulted in the 2011 economic protests in Malawi in July   3  Economic indicators  GDP  purchasing power parity   $8 272 billion  2006 est    GDP   real growth
