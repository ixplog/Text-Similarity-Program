The Porsche 968 was a luxury sports car sold by Porsche AG from 1992 to 1995  It took over the entry level position in Porsche s lineup from the 944  with which it shared about 20% of its parts  The 968 became the final model in an evolving line  starting almost 20 years earlier with the introduction of the Porsche 924   1  Introduction  Porsche s 944 model debuted for the 1982 model year  was updated as  944S  in 1987 and as  944S2  in 1989  Shortly after the start of production of the S2 variant  Porsche engineers began working on another set of significant upgrades for the model  as executives were planning a final  S3  variant of the 944  During the development phase  80% of the 944 s mechanical components were either significantly modified or completely replaced by the engineers  leaving so little of the outgoing S2 behind that Porsche management chose to introduce the variant as a new model  calling it the 968  In addition to the numerous mechanical upgrades  the new model also received significantly evolved styling both inside and out  with a more modern  streamlined look and more standard luxury than on the 944  Production was moved from the Audi plant in Neckarsulm  where the 924 and 944 had been manufactured under contract to Porsche   to Porsche s own factory in Zuffenhausen   The 968 was powered by an updated version of the 944 s straight four engine  now displacing 3 0 L with 104 mm bore  88 mm stroke and producing 240 PS  236 hp 177 kW   Changes to the 968 s powertrain also included the addition of Porsche s then new VarioCam variable valve timing system  newly optimized induction and exhaust systems  a dual mass flywheel  and updated engine management electronics among other more minor revisions  The 968 s engine was the second largest four cylinder ever offered in a production car up to that time  A new 6 speed manual transmission replaced the 944 s old 5 speed  and Porsche s dual mode Tiptronic automatic became an available option  Both the VarioCam timing system and Tiptronic transmission were very recent developments for Porsche  The Tiptronic transmission had debuted for the first time ever only 3 years prior to the debut of the 968  on the 1989 Type 964 911  The VarioCam timing system was first introduced on the 968 and would later become a feature of the Type 993 air cooled six cylinder engine   The 968 s styling was an evolution on that of the outgoing 944  itself styled evolutionarily from the earlier 924  but elements were borrowed from the more expensive 928 model in an attempt to create a  family resemblance  between models  and the swooping headlamp design  inspired by those of the 959  previewed similar units found later on the Type 993 911  Along with the new styling  the 968 featured numerous small equipment and detail upgrades  including a Fuba roof mounted antenna  updated single lens tail lamps   Cup  style 16  alloy wheels  a wider selection of interior and exterior colors  and a slightly updated  B  pillar and rear quarter window to accommodate adhesive installation to replace the older rubber gasket installation  Because some parts are interchangeable between the 968  944 and 924  some enthusiasts purchase those parts from Porsche parts warehouses as  upgrades  for their older models   Like the 944  the 968 was sold as both a coupe and a convertible  Much of the 968 s chassis was carried over from the 944 S2  which in itself shared many components with the 944 Turbo  internally numbered 951   Borrowed components include the Brembo sourced four piston brake calipers on all four wheels  aluminium semi trailing arms and aluminum front A arms  used in a Macpherson strut arrangement  The steel unibody structure was also very similar to that of the previous models  Porsche maintained that 80% of the car was new   2  968 Clubsport  From 1993 through 1995  Porsche offered a lighter weight  Club Sport  version of the 968 designed for enthusiasts seeking increased track performance  Much of the 968 s luxury oriented equipment was removed or taken off the options list  less sound deadening material was used  electrical windows were replaced with crank driven units  upgraded stereo systems  A C and sunroof were still optional as on the standard Coupe and Convertible models  In addition  Porsche installed manually adjustable lightweight Recaro racing seats rather than the standard power operated leather buckets  also manufactured by Recaro   a revised suspension system optimized and lowered by 20 mm for possible track use  17 inch wheels  also slightly wider to accommodate wider tires  rather than the 16 inch as found on the Coupe and wider tires  225 front and 255 rears rather than 205 and 225 respectively  The four spoke airbag steering wheel was replaced with a thicker rimmed three spoke steering wheel with no airbag  heated washer jets were replaced with non heated  vanity covers in the engine bay were deleted  as was the rear wiper  The Club Sport has no rear seats  unlike the 2+2 Coupé   Club Sports were only available in Grand Prix White  black  Speed yellow  Guards red  Riviera blue or Maritime blue  Seat backs were colour coded to the body  Club Sport decals were standard in either black  red or white but there was a  delete  option  All Club Sports had black interiors with the 944 S2 door cards  Due to the reduction in the number of electrical items the wiring loom was reduced in complexity which saved weight and also the battery was replaced with a smaller one  again reducing weight  With the no frills approach meaning less weight  as well as the optimising of the suspension  Porsche could focus media attention on the Club Sport variants fast road and track abilities  This helped to slightly bolster the flagging sales figures in the mid 1990s  The Club Sport variant achieved a  Performance Car Of The Year  award in 1993 from Performance Car magazine in the UK  Club Sport models were only officially available in the UK  Europe  Japan & Australia  although  grey market  cars found their way elsewhere  The declared weight of the 968 CS is 1320 kg  ~100 kg lighter than the regular 968  Acceleration from standstill to 62 mph is 6 3 seconds and a top speed is 160 mph   A UK only version called  968 Sport   was offered in 1994 and 1995  and was essentially a Club Sport model  and was produced on the same production line with similar chassis numbers  with electric windows  electric release boot  central locking  cloth comfort seats  different from both the standard and the Club Sport   With the added electrics the larger wiring loom was used  The Sport Variant also got back the two rear seats  again in the cloth material specific to the Sport  At £29 975  the 968 Sport was priced £5 500 lower than the standard 968  but had most of the latter s desirable  luxuries  and consequently outsold it by a large margin  306 of the 968 Sport models compared to 40 standard 968 coupés    A 968 CS driven by Peter Fitzgerald and Brett Peters won the 1993 Sandown 6 Hour race in the Australian competition debut of the model   3  968 Turbo S  In 1993  Porsche Motorsports at Weissach briefly produced a turbocharged 968 Turbo S  a fairly odd naming choice for Porsche which usually reserves the added  S  moniker for models that have been tuned for more power over a  lesser  counterpart  such as with the 911 Turbo  The 968 Turbo S shared the same body and interior as the Club Sport and visually can be identified by the NACA bonnet hood scoops  adjustable rear wing and deeper front spoiler  Powered by a large 8 valve SOHC cylinder head  944 Turbo S  with 3 0 Liter 944S2 style engine block  Tests conducted in 1993 produced a 0 to 60 miles per hour time of 4 7 seconds and a top speed of approximately 180 miles per hour  performance comparable to the much newer Type 996 911  It generated 305 bhp at 5600 rpm with a maximum torque of 368 ft lb at 3000rpm  Only 16 were produced in total and only for sale in mainland Europe   4  968 Turbo RS  Between 1992 and 1994  Porsche Motorsports Research and Development built and provided a full  Race  version  stripped out 968 Turbo S  for Porsche s customer race teams  The 968 Turbo RS was available in two variations  a 337 bhp version using the K27 turbocharger from the Turbo S  which was built to the German ADAC GT specification  ballast added to bring the car up to the 1350 kg minimum weight limit   and an international spec version which used a KKK L41 turbocharger producing 350 bhp and was reduced to 1212 kg in weight  Only 4 were ever produced   1 Guards Red  WPOZZZ96ZNS820065   1 Speed Yellow  WPOZZZ96ZPS896061   1 Black  WPOZZZ96ZPS896062  and 1 White  WPOZZZ96ZPS896063   These are the rarest 968s ever produced   5  Historical significance  The 968 was Porsche s last new front engined vehicle  of any type  before the introduction of the Cayenne SUV  Its discontinuation in 1995 coincided with that of the 928  Porsche s only other front engined car at the time   In 2010  Porsche released the Panamera a front engined  4 door sports touring sedan  A successor to the 928  based on that sedan s architecture  is predicted to follow   The 968 was also the last Porsche sold with a four cylinder engine  Final year 1995    6  Collectability  While lacking the wider ranging appeal of the 911  the 968 has nonetheless carved out its own niche in the hearts of enthusiasts  This is likely due to the 968 s unique combination of speed and practicality  and low production numbers  Clean  low mileage examples have become extremely scarce and expensive by 2013  In April 2012  when the Gooding & Company bidding ended and the auctioneer s hammer finally fell  the only 1 Red 968 Turbo RS 350 hp machine had fetched a hefty $346 000 price   7  References  8  External links
