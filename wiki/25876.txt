Anastasius I      c  431 – 9 July 518  was Byzantine Emperor from 491 to 518  During his reign the Roman eastern frontier underwent extensive re fortification  including the construction of Dara  a stronghold intended to counter the Persian fortress of Nisibis  During his reign was built one of the most fortified castle cities on the Adriatic Durrës Castle in Durrës   1  Background and personal characteristics  Anastasius was born at Dyrrhachium in the Latin speaking part of the Balkans  the date is unknown  but he is thought to have been born no later than 430 or 431  He was born into an Illyrian family  the son of Pompeius  born c  410   nobleman of Dyrrachium  and wife Anastasia Constantina  born c  410   His mother was an Arian  sister of Clearchus  also an Arian  and a paternal granddaughter of Gallus  born c  370   son of Anastasia  born c  352  and husband  in turn daughter of Flavius Claudius Constantius Gallus and wife and cousin Constantina   Anastasius had one eye black and one eye blue  heterochromia   and for that reason he was nicknamed Dicorus  Greek  Δίκορος   two pupiled     2  Accession  At the time of the death of Zeno  491   Anastasius  a palace official  silentiarius   held a very high character  and was raised to the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire by Ariadne  Zeno s widow  who preferred him to Zeno s brother  Longinus   Ariadne married him shortly after his accession on 20 May 491  His reign  though afterwards disturbed by foreign and internecine wars and religious distractions  commenced auspiciously  He gained the popular favour by a judicious remission of taxation  and displayed great vigour and energy in administering the affairs of the Empire   3  Foreign policy and wars  Anastasius engaged in the Isaurian War against the usurper Longinus and the Anastasian War against Sassanid Persia   The Isaurian War  492 497  was stirred up by the Isaurian supporters of Longinus  the brother of Zeno who was passed over in his succession in favor of Anastasius  The battle of Cotyaeum in 492  broke the back  of the revolt  but guerrilla warfare continued in the Isaurian mountains for some years longer   In the Anastasian War  502–505   Theodosiopolis and Amida were captured by the Sassanids  but Persian provinces also suffered severely and the Byzantines recovered Amida  Both adversaries were exhausted when peace was made in 506 on the basis of the status quo  Anastasius afterwards built the strong fortress of Daras to hold the Persians in check in Nisibis  The Balkan provinces were left denuded of troops  however  and were devastated by invasions of Slavs and Bulgars  to protect Constantinople and its vicinity against them  the emperor built the Anastasian Wall  extending from the Propontis to the Euxine   4  Domestic and ecclesiastical policies  The Emperor was a convinced Miaphysite  following the teachings of Cyril of Alexandria and Severus of Antioch who taught  One Incarnate Nature of Christ  in an undivided union of the Divine and human natures  but his ecclesiastical policy was moderate  he endeavoured to maintain the principle of the Henotikon of Zeno and the peace of the church  It was rebellious demonstrations of the Byzantine populace  that drove him in 512 to abandon this policy and adopt Miaphysitic programme  His consequent unpopularity in the European provinces was utilized by an ambitious man  named Vitalian  to organize a dangerous rebellion  in which he was assisted by a horde of  Huns   514–515   it was finally suppressed by a naval victory won by the general Marinus   5  Successor  The Anonymous Valesianus tells an account about his choosing of a successor  Anastasius could not decide which of his three nephews should succeed him  so he put a message under a couch and had his nephews take seats in the room  which also had two other seats  he believed that the nephew to sit on the special couch would be his proper heir  However  two of his nephews sat on the same couch  and the one with the concealed message remained empty   Then  after putting the matter to God in prayer  he determined that the first person to enter his room the next morning should be the next Emperor  and that person was Justin  the chief of his guards  In fact  Anastasius probably never thought of Justin as a successor  but the issue was decided for him after his death  At the end of his reign  he left the Imperial treasury richer by 23 000 000 solidi or 320 000 pounds of gold   Anastasius died childless in Constantinople on 9 July 518  some sources say 8 or 10 July  and was buried at the Church of the Holy Apostles   6  Family  Anastasius is known to have had a brother named Flavius Paulus  who served as Roman consul in 496  A sister in law  known as Magna  was mother to Irene and mother in law to Olybrius  This Olybrius was son of Anicia Juliana and Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus  The daughter of Olybrius and Irene was named Proba  She married Probus and was mother to a younger Juliana  This younger Juliana married another Anastasius and was mother of Areobindus  Placidia  and a younger Proba  Another nephew of Anastasius was Flavius Probus  Roman consul in 502  Caesaria  sister of Anastasius  married Secundinus  They were parents to Hypatius and Pompeius  Flavius Anastasius Paulus Probus Moschianus Probus Magnus  Roman Consul in 518 also was a great nephew of Anastasius  His daughter Juliana later married Marcellus  a brother of Justin II  The extensive family may well have included viable candidates for the throne   7  Byzantine Empire coinage reform  The main elements of the complex monetary system of the early Byzantine Empire  which suffered a partial collapse in the 5th century  were revived by Emperor Anastasius I  491–518  in 498  The new system involved three denominations of gold  the solidus and its half and third  and five of copper  the follis  worth 40 nummi and its fractions down to a nummus    A 40 nummi coin of Anastasius is depicted on the obverse of the Macedonian 50 denars banknote  issued in 1996   8  References   Notes  Les ancêtres de Charlemagne  1989  Continuité gentilice et continuité sénatoriale
