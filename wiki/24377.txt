The Porsche 912 is a sports car that was manufactured by Porsche of Germany between 1965 and 1969 as their entry level model  The 912 is a nimble handling compact performance four seat vehicle  delivering 90 SAE horsepower at 5800 rpm  It is capable of up to fuel economy  This combination is possible because of a high efficiency petrol engine  low weight  and low drag  A variant of the Type 911  one of the most famous and successful sports cars of all time  the Type 912 initially outsold the 911  boosting the manufacturer s total production until success of the 911 was assured   1  History  Concerned that the considerable price increase of a Type 911 with  flat  six cylinder powerplant over the Type 356 would cost the company sales and narrow brand appeal  in 1963 Porsche executives decided to introduce a new four cylinder entry level model  Like the 911  original internal factory designation  901    the four cylinder 912 was originally known at Zuffenhausen by a number with a zero in the middle  but the  902  designation was never used publicly    912  as project number was used after 1968 to indicate the 12 cylinder flat engine developed for Porsche 917 racing car   In 1963 Porsche assigned Dan Schwartz  later Chief Departmental Manager for Development  Mechanics  a project to oversee design and construction of a new horizontally opposed four cylinder engine for the 902  utilizing components from the new 901 six cylinder engine  that would produce higher performance than their 356SC engine  and be less costly and complex than their Carrera 2 engine  Another option explored by Claus von Rücker was to increase displacement of the 356 Type 616 engine to 1 8 liters  add Kugelfischer fuel injection  and modify both valve and cooling systems  Considering performance  cost  and scheduling  Porsche discontinued both of these design projects  and instead developed a third option  to tailor the 1 6 liter Type 616 engine to the 902   Before 911 production commenced in 1964  the Porsche Vehicle Research Department had set aside chassis numbers 13328  13329  13330  13352  and 13386 through 13397 for research testing of the 902  research vehicle Serial Number 13394 is the oldest 902 known to exist today  In production form  the Type 912 combined a 911 chassis   bodyshell with the 1 6L  four cylinder  push rod Type 616 36 engine  based upon the Type 616 16 engine used in the Type 356SC of 1964 1965  With a lower compression ratio and new Solex carburetors  the Type 616 36 engine produced five less horsepower than the 616 16  but delivered about the same maximum torque at 3 500 rpm versus 4 200 rpm for the 616 16  Compared to the 911  the resulting production Type 912 vehicle demonstrated superior weight distribution  handling  and range  To bring 912 pricing close to the 356  Porsche also deleted some features standard on the 911   As production of the 356 model concluded in 1965  on April 5  1965 Porsche officially began production of the 912 coupe  Styling  performance  quality construction  reliability  and price made the 912 a very attractive buy to both new and old customers  and it substantially outsold the 911 during the first few years of production  Porsche produced nearly 30 000 912 coupe units and about 2500 912 Targa body style units  Porsche s patented variation of a cabriolet  during a five year manufacturing run  Production of the Targa  complete with removable roof and heavy transparent plastic rear windows openable with a zipper  later called  Version I  by Porsche and the  soft window Targa  by enthusiasts   commenced in December 1966 as a 1967 model  In January 1968  Porsche also made available a Targa  Version II  option   hard window Targa   with fixed glass rear window  transforming the Targa into a coupe with removable roof   The Type 912 was also made in a special version for the German autobahn police  polizei   the 100 000th Porsche car was a 912 Targa for the police of Baden Württemberg  the home state of Porsche  In the April 1967 edition  the Porsche factory s Christophorus Magazine noted   On 21 December 1966  Porsche celebrated a particularly proud anniversary  The 100 000th Porsche  a 912 Targa outfitted for the police  was delivered    Porsche executives decided that after the 1969 model year  continuation of 912 production would not be viable  due to both internal and external factors  First  production facilities used for the 912 were reallocated to a new 914 6  a six cylinder high performance version of the 914 Porsche Volkswagen joint effort vehicle  Second  the 911 platform had returned to Porsche s traditional three performance level ladder  including a most powerful 911S  a fuel injected 911E  and a base model 911T  with pricing largely in line with market expectations  Third  more stringent United States engine emission control regulations also had a bearing on the decision  Ferry Porsche stated  It would have taken some trouble to prepare the 912 for the new exhaust rules  and with the arrival of the 914 we would have had three different engines to keep current  That was too many    Porsche had constructed more than 32 000 of the Type 912 from April 1965 to July 1969  For the 1970 model year the four cylinder 914 superseded the 912 as Porsche s entry level model  which Porsche had thought would be less expensive for them to manufacture and sell than the 912  In practice  a deterioration in relationships between Porsche and Volkswagen   who had designed and planned to manufacture the 914   severely curtailed the intended cost reduction  and 914 production was discontinued in early 1976   After a six year absence  the 912 was re introduced to North America as the 1976 model year 912E  internal factory designation 923  which shared the  G Series  bodywork with the 911S  The  Prototyp  Museum collection in Hamburg  Germany includes a 912E preseries vehicle constructed utilizing a 911 Chassis No  911 520 1617 and four cylinder VW Porsche 90HP 2 0L Type 4 similar to the late model 2 0L 914 4  Once in production  the 912E was powered by an 86 bhp 2 0 L Volkswagen air cooled engine  refined with a new Bosch L Jetronic  Air Flow Controlled  fuel injection system  The 912E occupied the entry level position left vacant by the discontinuation of the 914  while the new 924 舑 another Porsche Volkswagen joint effort vehicle and the 914 s official replacement 舑 was being finalized and put into production  During the production run of May 1975 to July 1976  Porsche manufactured nearly 2 100 of the 912E  targeted to the United States market   2  Motorsport  Sold to the public for street use  the Porsche 912 has also proven successful as a race car  from production years to current vintage events  In 1967 the 912 contributed to Porsche factory rally history when independent Polish driver Sobiesław Zasada drove a factory loaned 912  bearing Polish plate 6177 KR  to capture the European Rally Championship for Group 1 series touring cars  In the 1967 Rally of Poland  the second oldest rally in the world and one of the oldest motorsport events in the world  Zasada drove his 912 race No  47 to finish first overall out of a starting field of 50 entries   As a vintage rally car  on January 29  2012 Hayden Burvill  Alastair Caldwell  and their #35 1968 Porsche 912 finished first in class  and 7th overall in the 2012 London to Cape Town World Cup Rally  a 14 country  three continent  14 000 kilometre  26 driving days event   3  References  The Complete Porsche 912 Guide  by Duane
