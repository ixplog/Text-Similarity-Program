A month is a unit of time  used with calendars  which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon  month and Moon are cognates  The traditional concept arose with the cycle of moon phases  such months  lunations  are synodic months and last approximately 29 53 days  From excavated tally sticks  researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon s phases as early as the Paleolithic age  Synodic months  based on the Moon s orbital period with respect to the Earth Sun line  are still the basis of many calendars today  and are used to divide the year   1  Types of months in astronomy  The following types of months are mainly of significance in astronomy  most of them  but not the distinction between sidereal and tropical months  first recognized in Babylonian lunar astronomy   The sidereal month is defined as the Moon s orbital period in a non rotating frame of reference  which on average is equal to its rotation period in the same frame   It is about 27 32166 days  27 days  7 hours  43 minutes  11 6 seconds   The exact duration of the orbital period cannot be easily determined  because the  non rotating frame of reference  cannot be observed directly  However  it is approximately equal to the time it takes the Moon to pass twice a  fixed  star  different stars give different results because all have proper motions and are not really fixed in position    A synodic month is the most familiar lunar cycle  defined as the time interval between two consecutive occurrences of a particular phase  such as new moon or full moon  as seen by an observer on Earth  The mean length of the synodic month is 29 53059 days  29 days  12 hours  44 minutes  2 8 seconds   Due to the eccentric orbit of the lunar orbit around Earth  and to a lesser degree  the Earth’s elliptical orbit around the Sun   the length of a synodic month can vary by up to seven hours   The tropical month is the average time for the Moon to pass twice through the same equinox point of the sky  It is 27 32158 days  very slightly shorter than the sidereal month  27 32166  days  because of precession of the equinoxes  Unlike the sidereal month  it can be measured precisely   An anomalistic month is the average time the Moon takes to go from perigee to perigee   the point in the Moon s orbit when it is closest to Earth  An anomalistic month is about 27 55455 days on average   The draconic month or nodal month is the period in which the Moon returns to the same node of its orbit  the nodes are the two points where the Moon s orbit crosses the plane of the Earth s orbit  Its duration is about 27 21222 days on average  A synodic month is longer than a sidereal month because the Earth Moon system is orbiting the Sun in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth  Therefore  the Sun appears to move with respect to the stars  and it takes about 2 2 days longer for the Moon to return to the same apparent position with respect to the Sun   An anomalistic month is longer than a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth  one revolution in nine years  Therefore  the Moon takes a little longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star   A draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month because the nodes move in the opposite direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth  one revolution in 18 years  Therefore  the Moon returns to the same node slightly earlier than it returns to the same star   2  Calendrical consequences  At the simplest level  most well known lunar calendars are based on the initial approximation that 2 lunations last 59 days  a 30 day full month followed by a 29 day hollow month — but this is only roughly accurate  and eventually needs correction by using larger cycles  or the equivalent of leap days  Additionally  the synodic month does not fit easily into the year  which makes accurate  rule based lunisolar calendars complicated  The most common solution to this problem is the Metonic cycle  which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 tropical years  which add up to not quite 6940 days   However  a Metonic calendar will drift against the seasons by about 1 day every 200 years  Metonic calendars include the calendar used in the Antikythera Mechanism about 2000 years ago  and the Hebrew calendar   The complexity required in an accurate lunisolar calendar may explain why solar calendars  with months which no longer relate to the phase of the Moon  but are based only on the motion of the Sun against the sky  have generally replaced lunar calendars for civil use in most societies   3  Months in various calendars  3 1  Beginning of the lunar month  The Hellenic calendars  the Hebrew Lunisolar calendar and the Islamic Lunar calendar started the month with the first appearance of the thin crescent of the new moon   However  the motion of the Moon in its orbit is very complicated and its period is not constant  The date and time of this actual observation depends on the exact geographical longitude as well as latitude  atmospheric conditions  the visual acuity of the observers  etc  Therefore the beginning and lengths of months defined by observation cannot be accurately predicted   While some like the Jewish Karaites still rely on actual moon observations  most people use the Gregorian solar calendar   3 2  Julian and Gregorian calendars  The Gregorian calendar  like the Julian calendar before it  has twelve months   The mean month length of the Gregorian calendar is 30 436875 days   Months existing in the Roman calendar in the past include   Mercedonius  an occasional month after February to realign the calendar   Quintilis  renamed to July in honour of Julius Caesar   Sextilis  renamed to August in honour of Augustus  The famous mnemonic Thirty days hath September is the most common way of teaching the lengths of the months in the English speaking world   Also  note that the latter 10 months of the year form a pair of 31 30 31 30 31 day 5 month cycles   The knuckles of the four fingers of one s hand and the spaces between them can be used to remember the lengths of the months  By making a fist  each month will be listed as one proceeds across the hand  All months landing on a knuckle are 31 days long and those landing between them are not  When the knuckle of the index finger is reached  July   go back to the first knuckle  or over to the first knuckle on the other fist  held next to the first  and continue with August  This physical mnemonic has been taught to primary school students for many decades   This cyclical pattern of month lengths matches the musical keyboard alternation of white and black keys  with the note  F  correlating to the month of January    3 2 1  Calends  nones  and ides  The ides occur on the thirteenth day in eight of the months  but in March  May  July  and October  they occur on the fifteenth  The nones always occur 8 days before the ides  i e   on the fifth or the seventh  The calends are always the first day of the month   3 3  Hebrew Calendar  The Hebrew calendar has 12 or 13 months   Nisan  30 days ניסן  Iyyar  30 days אייר  Sivan  30 days סיון  Tammuz  29 days תמוז  Av  30 days אב  Elul  29 days אלול  Tishri  30 days תשרי  Heshvan  29 30 days חשון  Kislev  29 30

commonly than the lunar calendar  There are 12 months and the numbers of days follow the Julian and Gregorian calendar   The Khmer lunar calendar contains 12 months  however  the eighth month is repeated  as a  leap month   every two or three years  making 13 months instead of 12   មិគសិរ  បុស  មាគ  ផល្គុន  ចេត្រ  វិសាខ  ពិសាខ  ជេស្ឋ  ឤស឵ធ  or in the case of a year with a leap month   បឋមសាធ

anymore  but some Icelandic holidays and annual feasts are still calculated from it  It has 12 months  broken down into two groups of six often termed  winter months  and  summer months   The calendar is peculiar in that the months always start on the same weekday rather than on the same date  Hence Þorri always starts on a Friday sometime between January 19 and January 25  Old style  January 9 to

were attested by Bede in his work On Chronology written in the 8th century  His months are probably those as written in the Northumbrian dialect of Old English which he was familiar with  The months were so named after the moon  the new moon marking the end of an old month and start of a new month  the full moon occurring in the middle of the month  after which the month was named   Æfterra ġēola

days  epagomenes  at the end of the year  The months were divided into 3  weeks  of ten days each  Because the ancient Egyptian year was almost a quarter of a day shorter than the solar year and stellar events  wandered  through the calendar  it is referred to as Annus Vagus or  Wandering Year    Thout  Paopi  Hathor  Koiak  Tooba  Emshir  Paremhat  Paremoude  Pashons  Paoni  Epip  Mesori  3

government for about twelve years from late 1793  There were twelve months of 30 days each  grouped into three ten day weeks called décades  The five or six extra days needed to approximate the tropical year were placed after the months at the end of each year  A period of four years ending on a leap day was to be called a Franciade  It began at the autumn equinox   Autumn   Vendémiaire
