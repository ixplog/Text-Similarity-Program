Judicial economy refers broadly to the principle that the limited resources of the legal system or a given court should be conserved   1  Multiple causes of action in a given case   Judicial economy  most commonly refers to the refusal of a court to decide one or more claims raised in a case  on the grounds that it has decided other claims in the case and that its decision on those claims should satisfy the parties  For example  the plaintiff may claim that the defendant s actions violated three distinct laws  Having found for the plaintiff for a violation of the first law  the court then has the discretion to exercise judicial economy and refuse to make a decision on the remaining two claims  on the grounds that the finding of one violation should be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff   2  Threshold issue in a given case  In the presence of a threshold issue that will ultimately decide a case  a court may elect to hear that issue rather than proceeding with a full blown trial   3  Class action lawsuits  Class action lawsuits are another example of judicial economy in action  as they are often tried as a single case  yet involve many cases with similar facts  Rather than trying each case individually  which would unduly burden the judicial system  the cases can be consolidated into a class action
