Old English  Ænglisc  Anglisc  Englisc  or Anglo Saxon is an early form of the English language that was spoken and written by the Anglo Saxons and their descendants in parts of what are now England and southern and eastern Scotland between at least the mid 5th century and the mid 12th century   It is a West Germanic language closely related to Old Frisian and Old Saxon  In most respects  including its grammar  it was much closer to modern German and Icelandic than to modern English  It was fully inflected with five grammatical cases  nominative  accusative  genitive  dative  and instrumental   three grammatical numbers  singular  plural  and dual  and three grammatical genders  masculine  feminine  and neuter    Adjectives  pronouns and  sometimes  participles agreed with their antecedent nouns in case  number and gender  Finite verbs agreed with their subject in person and number   Nouns came in numerous declensions  with deep parallels in Latin  Ancient Greek and Sanskrit   Verbs came in nine main conjugations  seven strong and two weak   each with numerous subtypes  as well as a few additional less common conjugations and a handful of irregular verbs  The main difference from other ancient Indo European languages  such as Latin  is that verbs can be conjugated in only two tenses  vs  the six  tenses  – really tense aspect combinations – of Latin   and have no synthetic passive voice   Old English nouns also had grammatical gender  while nouns in modern English have only natural gender  That is  the grammatical gender of a given noun did not necessarily correspond to its natural gender  even for nouns referring to people  For example  sēo sunne  the Sun  was feminine  se mōna  the Moon  was masculine  and þæt wīf  the woman wife  was neuter   Compare German cognates die Sonne  der Mond  das Weib   Pronominal usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender  when it conflicted   Written Old English encompasses many literary registers in both poetry and prose  From the 9th century  Old English experienced heavy influence from Old Norse  a member of the related North Germanic group of languages   1  History  Old English was not static  and its usage covered a period of 700 years  from the Anglo Saxon settlement of Britain in the 5th century to the late 11th century  some time after the Norman invasion   Old English is a West Germanic language  developing out of Ingvaeonic  also known as North Sea Germanic  dialects from the 5th century  Anglo Saxon literacy developed after Christianisation in the late 7th century  The oldest surviving text of Old English literature is Cædmon s Hymn  composed between 658 and 680  There is a limited corpus of runic inscriptions from the 5th to 7th centuries  but the oldest coherent runic texts  notably Franks Casket  date to the 8th century   The history of Old English can be subdivided into   Prehistoric Old English  c  450 to 650   for this period  Old English is mostly a reconstructed language as no literary witnesses survive  with the exception of limited epigraphic evidence   This language  or bloc of languages  spoken by the Angles  Saxons  and Jutes  and pre dating documented Old English or Anglo Saxon  has also been called Primitive Old English   Early Old English  c  650 to 900   the period of the oldest manuscript traditions  with authors such as Cædmon  Bede  Cynewulf and Aldhelm   Late Old English  c  900 to 1066   the final stage of the language leading up to the Norman conquest of England and the subsequent transition to Early Middle English  The Old English period is followed by Middle English  12th to 15th century   Early Modern English  c  1480 to 1650  and finally Modern English  after 1650    2  Influence of other languages  In the course of the Early Middle Ages  Old English assimilated some aspects of a few languages with which it came in contact  such as the two dialects of Old Norse from the contact with the Norsemen or  Danes  who by the late 9th century controlled large tracts of land in northern and eastern England  which came to be known as the Danelaw   2 1  Latin influence  A large percentage of the educated and literate population of the time were competent in Latin  which was the scholarly and diplomatic lingua franca of Europe  It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the entry of individual Latin words into Old English based on which patterns of linguistic change they have undergone  There were at least three notable periods of Latin influence  The first occurred before the ancestral Angles and Saxons left continental Europe for Britain  The second began when the Anglo Saxons were converted to Christianity and Latin speaking priests became widespread  See Latin influence in English  Early Middle Ages for details   The third and largest single transfer of Latin based words happened after the Norman Conquest of 1066  when an enormous number of Norman  Old French  words began to influence the language  Most of these Oïl language words were themselves derived from Old French and ultimately from classical Latin  although a notable stock of Norse words were introduced or re introduced in Norman form  The Norman Conquest approximately marks the end of Old English and the advent of Middle English   One of the ways the influence of Latin can be seen is that many Latin words for activities came to also be used to refer to the people engaged in those activities  an idiom carried over from Anglo Saxon but using Latin words  This can be seen in words like militia  assembly  movement  and service   The language was further altered by the transition away from the runic alphabet  also known as futhorc or fuþorc  to the Latin alphabet  which was also a significant factor in the developmental pressures brought to bear on the language  Old English words were spelled  more or less  as they were pronounced  Often  the Latin alphabet fell short of being able to adequately represent Anglo Saxon phonetics  Spellings  therefore  can be thought of as best attempt approximations of how the language actually sounded   The  silent  letters in many Modern English words were pronounced in Old English  for example  the c and h in cniht  the Old English ancestor of the modern knight  were pronounced  Another side effect of spelling Old English words phonetically using the Latin alphabet was that spelling was extremely variable  A word s spelling could also reflect differences in the phonetics of the writer s regional dialect  Words also endured idiosyncratic spelling choices of individual authors  some of whom varied spellings between works  Thus  for example  the word and could be spelt either and or ond   2 2  Norse influence  The second major source of loanwords to Old English were the Scandinavian words introduced during the Viking invasions of the 9th and 10th centuries  In addition to a great many place names  these consist mainly of items of basic vocabulary  and words concerned with particular administrative aspects of the Danelaw  that is  the area of land under Viking control  which included extensive holdings all along the eastern coast of England and Scotland    The Vikings spoke Old Norse  a language related to Old English in that both derived from the same ancestral Proto Germanic language  It is very common for the intermixing of speakers of different dialects  such as those that occur during times of political unrest  to result in a mixed language  and one theory holds that exactly such a mixture of Old Norse and Old English helped accelerate the decline of case endings in Old English   Apparent confirmation of this is the fact that simplification of the case endings occurred earliest in the north and latest in the south west  the area farthest away from Viking influence  Regardless of the truth of this theory  the influence of Old Norse on the lexicon of the English language has been profound  responsible for such basic vocabulary items as sky  leg  the pronoun they  the verb form are  and hundreds of other words   2 3  Celtic influence  Traditionally  and following the Anglo Saxon preference prevalent in the 19th century  many maintain that the influence of Brythonic Celtic on English has been small  citing the small number of Celtic loanwords taken into the language  The number of Celtic loanwords is of a lower order than either Latin or Scandinavian  However  a more recent and still minority view is that distinctive Celtic traits can be discerned in syntax from the post Old English period  such as the regular progressive construction and analytic word order in opposition to the Germanic languages   3  Dialects  Old English should not be regarded as a single monolithic entity just as Modern English is also not monolithic  It emerged over time out of the many dialects and languages of the colonising tribes  and it was not until the later Anglo Saxon period that they fused together into Old English  Even then  it continued to exhibit local language variation  remnants of which remain in Modern English dialects   Thus it is misleading  for example  to consider Old English as having a single sound system  Rather  there were multiple Old English sound systems  Old English has variation along regional lines as well as variation across different times   For example  the language attested in Wessex during the time of Æthelwold of Winchester  which is named Late West Saxon  or Æthelwoldian Saxon   is considerably different from the language attested in Wessex during the time of Alfred the Great s court  which is named Early West Saxon  or Classical West Saxon or Alfredian Saxon   Furthermore  the difference between Early West Saxon and Late West Saxon is of such a nature that Late West Saxon is not directly descended from Early West Saxon  despite what the similarity in name implies    The four main dialectal forms of Old English were Mercian  Northumbrian  Kentish  and West Saxon  Each of those dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island  Of these  Northumbria south of the Tyne and most of Mercia were overrun by the Vikings during the 9th century  The portion of Mercia that was successfully defended and all of Kent were then integrated into Wessex   After the process of unification of the diverse Anglo Saxon kingdoms in 878 by Alfred the Great  there is a marked decline in the importance of regional dialects  This is not because they stopped existing  as evidenced both by the existence of Middle and later Modern English dialects   However  the bulk of the surviving documents from the Anglo Saxon period are written in the dialect of Wessex  Alfred s kingdom  It seems likely that with consolidation of power  it became necessary to standardise the language of government to reduce the difficulty of administering the more remote areas of the kingdom  As a result  documents were written in the West Saxon dialect  Not only this  but Alfred was passionate about the spread of the vernacular  and brought many scribes to his region from Mercia to record previously unwritten texts   The Church was affected likewise  especially since Alfred initiated an ambitious programme to translate religious materials into English  To retain his patronage and ensure the widest circulation of the translated materials  the monks and priests engaged in the programme worked in his dialect  Alfred himself seems to have translated books out of Latin and into English  notably Pope Gregory I s treatise on administration  Pastoral Care   Because of the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions  there is little or no written evidence for the development of non Wessex dialects after Alfred s unification   Thomas Spencer Baynes claimed in 1856 that  owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex  the relics of Anglo Saxon accent  idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the Somerset dialect   Even after the maximum Anglo Saxon expansion  Old English was never spoken all over the Kingdom of England  not only was Medieval Cornish spoken all over Cornwall  it was also spoken in adjacent parts of Devon into the age of the Plantagenets  long after the Norman Conquest  Cumbric may have survived into the 12th century in parts of Cumbria and Welsh may have been spoken on the English side of the Anglo Welsh border  In addition to the Celtic languages  Norse was spoken in some areas under Danish law   4  Phonology  The inventory of classical Old English  i e  Late West Saxon  surface phones  as usually reconstructed  is as follows   The sounds marked in parentheses in the chart above are allophones   is an allophone of occurring after and when geminated  is an allophone of occurring before and  are allophones of respectively  occurring between vowels or voiced consonants  are allophones of occurring in coda position after front and back vowels respectively  is an allophone of occurring after a vowel  and  at an earlier stage of the language  in the syllable onset  The front mid rounded vowels occur in some dialects of Old English  but not in the best attested Late West Saxon dialect   Vowels were not the only letters and sounds different from Modern English  In Old English  c always sounded like the modern k  never that of s  G sounded like the y in yes when it was before or after a palatal vowel or any diphthong  but it sounded approximately like the g in go when it was before or after a guttural vowel or a mixed vowel   Letters that are present in Modern English but are completely absent from Old English include j  q  v  and z  The letter k was used  but only rarely   5  Sound changes  The sound change in  one  is  however  somewhat reminiscent of other cases of  smearing  or breaking of short o  as in Spanish fuerte  puerto   originally forte  porto  as in Italian   as well as in Kashubian  where the letter ò also represents  wɛ    6  Grammar  6 1  Morphology  Unlike Modern English  Old English is a language rich with morphological diversity  It maintains several distinct cases  the nominative  accusative  genitive  dative and  vestigially  instrumental  The only remnants of this system in Modern English are in a few pronouns  the meanings of I  nominative  my  genitive  and me  accusative dative  in the first person provide an example  and in the possessive ending    s   which derives from the genitive ending   es    The verb identifies person  number  tense  and mood  Verbs have three moods  Indicative  Subjunctive  and Imperative   They have two numbers  Singular and Plural   three genders  Masculine  Feminine  and Neuter   and only two synthetic tenses  simple present and simple past   Old English grammar also does not contain a synthetic passive  However  Old English does occasionally use compound constructions to express other verbal aspects  the future and the passive voice  in these we see the beginnings of the compound tenses of Modern English   Old English verbs are separated into two categories according to how they form tenses  Strong verbs change tense by altering the root vowel  like irregular verbs in Modern English  and weak verbs change tense by adding a suffix to the end of the verb  like the –ed or  s in regular verbs in Modern English   Throughout time  however  most of the strong verbs of Old English had either shifted into regular verbs in Modern English or disappeared from the English language altogether  According to linguist Edward Finegan  the number of strong verbs in English has dropped from 333  including  burn  and  help   to 68 irregular verbs today  though conversely  there are also a few weak verbs that have shifted into irregular form  such as  dive  and  wear   and there are also some verbs which have debatable regularity status  such as  sneaked  and  snuck  for  sneak   In comparison to Modern English  Old English had far more irregularity in verb conjugation   6 2  Syntax  Old English syntax was similar in many ways to that of modern English  However  there were some important differences  Some were simply consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection – e g   word order was generally freer  In addition   The default word order was verb second and more like modern German than modern English   There was no do support in questions and negatives   Multiple negatives could stack up in a sentence  and intensified each other  negative concord   which is not always the case in modern English   Sentences with subordinate clauses of the type  when X  Y   e g   When I got home  I ate dinner   did not use a wh type conjunction  but rather used a th type correlative conjunction  e g  þā X  þā Y in place of  when X  Y    The wh type conjunctions were used only as interrogative pronouns and indefinite pronouns   Similarly  wh  forms were not used as relative pronouns  as in  the man who saw me  or  the car that I bought    Instead  an indeclinable word þe was used  often in conjunction with the definite article  which was declined for case  number and gender    7  Orthography  Old English was first written in runes  futhorc  but shifted to a  minuscule  half uncial script of the Latin alphabet introduced by Irish Christian missionaries from around the 9th century  This was replaced by insular script  a cursive and pointed version of the half uncial script  This was used until the end of the 12th century when continental Carolingian minuscule  also known as Caroline  replaced the insular   The letter ðæt  called eth or edh in modern English  was an alteration of Latin   and the runic letters thorn and wynn are borrowings from futhorc  Also used was a symbol for the conjunction and  a character similar to the number seven    called a Tironian note   and a symbol for the relative pronoun þæt  a thorn with a crossbar through the ascender     Macrons over vowels were rarely used to indicate long vowels  Also used occasionally were abbreviations for a following m or n  All of the sound descriptions below are given using IPA symbols   7 1  Conventions of modern editions  A number of changes are traditionally made in published modern editions of the original Old English manuscripts  Some of these conventions include the introduction of punctuation and the substitutions of symbols  The symbols         are used in modern editions  although their shapes in the insular script are considerably different  The long s is substituted by its modern counterpart   Insular is usually substituted with its modern counterpart  which is ultimately a Carolingian symbol    Additionally  modern editions often distinguish between a velar and palatal and with diacritic dots above the putative palatals      The wynn symbol is usually replaced with   Macrons are usually found in modern editions to indicate putative long vowels  while they are usually lacking in the originals  In older printed editions of Old English works  an acute accent mark was used to maintain cohesion between Old English and Old Norse printing   The alphabetical symbols found in Old English writings and their substitute symbols found in modern editions are listed below   Doubled consonants are geminated  the geminate fricatives    and cannot be voiced   8  Literature  Old English literature  though more abundant than literature of the continent before AD 1000 is nonetheless scant  In his supplementary article to the 1935 posthumous edition of Bright s Anglo Saxon Reader  Dr  James Hulbert writes   Some of the most important surviving works of Old English literature are Beowulf  an epic poem  the Anglo Saxon Chronicle  a record of early English history  the Franks Casket  an inscribed early whalebone artefact  and Caedmon s Hymn  a Christian religious poem  There are also a number of extant prose works  such as sermons and saints  lives  biblical translations  and translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers  legal documents  such as laws and wills  and practical works on grammar  medicine  and geography  Still  poetry is considered the heart of Old English literature  Nearly all Anglo Saxon authors are anonymous  with a few exceptions  such as Bede and Caedmon   9  Text samples  9 1  Beowulf  The first example is taken from the opening lines of the epic poem Beowulf  This passage describes how Hrothgar s legendary ancestor Scyld was found as a baby  washed ashore  and adopted by a noble family  The translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order  As such  it is not typical of Old English prose  The modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem   The words in brackets are implied in the Old English by noun case and the bold words in brackets are explanations of words that have slightly different meanings in a modern context  Notice how what is used by the poet where a word like lo or behold would be expected  This usage is similar to what ho   both an expression of surprise and a call to attention   A semi fluent translation in Modern English would be   Lo  We have heard of majesty of the Spear Danes  of those nation kings in the days of yore  and how those noblemen promoted zeal  Scyld Scefing took away mead benches from bands of enemies  from many tribes  he terrified earls  Since he was first found destitute  he gained consolation for that  he grew under the heavens  prospered in honours  until each of those who lived around him over the sea had to obey him  give him tribute  That was a good king   9 2  The Lord s Prayer  This text of the Lord s Prayer is presented in the standardised West Saxon literary dialect  with added macrons for vowel length  markings for probable palatalized consonants  modern punctuation  and the replacement of the letter wynn with w   9 3  Charter of Cnut  This is a proclamation from King Cnut the Great to his earl Thorkell the Tall and the English people written in AD 1020  Unlike the previous two examples  this text is prose rather than poetry  For ease of reading  the passage has been divided into sentences while the pilcrows represent the original division   10  Old English as a living language  Like other historical languages  Old English has been used by scholars and enthusiasts of later periods to create texts either imitating Anglo Saxon literature or deliberately transferring it to a different cultural context  Examples include Alistair Campbell and J  R  R  Tolkien  A number of websites devoted to Neo Paganism and Historical Reenactment offer reference material and forums promoting the active use of Old English  By far the most ambitious project is the Old English Wikipedia  but most of the Neo Old English texts published online bear little resemblance to the historical model and are riddled with very basic grammatical mistakes   11  See also  Exeter Book  Go  verb
