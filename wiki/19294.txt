This article is about the demographic features of the population of Morocco  including population density  ethnicity  education level  health of the populace  economic status  religious affiliations and other aspects of the population   The population of Morocco is estimated in 2013 at 35 million  The overwhelming majority of Moroccans are of Arab Berber descent  whether they speak the Berber language or not  Part of Moroccans identify themselves as Berbers through the spoken language  through a mix of family tribal territorial ties  or through both  Another part of Moroccans identify themselves as Arabized Berbers or simply as Arabs  mostly based on them speaking Moroccan Arabic and or not being able to speak Berber  Some of them believe they have an Arab descent from the Arabian Peninsula or the Levant  Some Moroccans believe to be of mixed Arab Berber descent or of Berber Arab Andalusian ancestry  There are no official figures about the exact ethnic origins of all Moroccans  but the implicitly accepted idea inside and outside Morocco is that Moroccans are essentially mixed Arab Berbers   Morocco is inhabited by Berbers  imazighen  since at least 5 000 years ago  Some estimate the presence of Berbers to be 8000+ years old  The oldest known sovereign state in Morocco is the Berber Kingdom of Mauretaina from 110 BC  Part of the northern areas of Morocco was for limited periods under the rule of Romans  Vandals  Byzantine principalities  sometimes in alliance with the indigenous Berbers  such as the one of Julian  count of Ceuta  There was probably a high occurrence of intermarriage and interbreeding between some Berbers and European settlers  laying the foundation for the emergence of Moorish and Romano Berber cultures  Since around 710 AD  many Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula and Arabized Levantine people conquered the territory or migrated to it during the Umayyad conquest  and long after it was repelled  The deep and mountainous areas of ancient Morocco remained always under Berber control  A small minority of the population is identified as Haratin and Gnaoua  dark skinned sedentary agriculturalists of the southern oases that speak either Berber or Moroccan Arabic   About 95% of Moroccans are considered to be Sunni Muslims religiously or culturally  The numbers of the Jewish minority has decreased significantly since the creation of the State of Israel in 1948  Today there are less than 5 000 Moroccan Jews inside the country  Thousands of Moroccan Jews living in Europe  Israel and North America visit the country regularly  There is a small but apparently growing minority of Moroccan Christians made of local Moroccan converts  not Europeans   Estimates of Moroccan Christians vary wildly between 30 000 and 300 000  Most of the 100 000 foreign residents are French people  Spaniards  Algerians and sub Saharan African students  There is a small community of Shia Muslim converts in northwestern Morocco of unknown numbers  Both Christian and Shia Muslim Moroccans and their religious activities are under surveillance and restrictions from Moroccan authorities as they are seen as a threat to the dominance of Sunni Islam and the monarch s religious authority  The number of non believers and non religious Moroccans is unknown but could be in the 10 000s  Secular  non religious  and Western life styles are visible in all major Moroccan cities among many rich or educated Moroccans  For example  Moroccans consume every year hundreds of millions of liters of locally and legally produced wine and beer  As alcohol beverages are strongly banned by Islam  their consumption in Morocco is usually considered as a strong indicator of non religiosity or of a secular life style that departs from Islam and traditional life style in general   1  Population  Source  Haut Commissariat au Plan  HCP   2  Languages  Classical Arabic and the Berber language  Tamazight  are Morocco s two official languages  The spoken languages in daily life are  Berber language  Moroccan Arabic  Darija   and Hassaniya Arabic  in the extreme south only    About 12 ~ 15 million Moroccans speak Berber in three varieties  Rif Berber  Shilha  and Central Atlas Tamazight  as a first language  About 30 ~ 33 million Moroccans speak Moroccan Arabic  which has also regional varieties  as a first language  including Hassaniya Arabic  French is an implicitly  official language  of government and big business  and is taught throughout school and still serves as Morocco s primary language of   economics  and scientific university education  French is also widely used in the media  Morocco is a member of La Francophonie  Berber activists have struggled since the 1960s for the recognition of their language as an official language of Morocco  which was achieved in July 2011 following the February 20th 2011 uprising   About 20 000 Moroccans in the northern part of the country speak some Spanish  English  while still far behind French in terms of the number of proficient speakers  is rapidly becoming a foreign language of choice among educated youth and business people  It has been taught to Moroccan students after the fourth year of elementary school since the education reforms of 2002   3  Status of women  The literacy rate is 51 percent for males and 42 5 percent for females  26 percent of the non agricultural labor is female  The ratio of boys to girls in primary and secondary schools is 87 to 9  In the past 20 years  the government has taken initiatives to improve the status of women in society  For instance  the Moudawana 2003 code of law has greatly improved the family status code  It has given women the right to make decisions on marriage  divorce  and custody of children in the case of remarriage divorce  Nevertheless  gender bias is still commonplace in education  employment and the law   4  Main populated areas  Most Moroccans live west and north of the Atlas Mountains  a range that insulates the country from the Sahara Desert  Casablanca is the largest city and the center of business and industry  and has the leading seaport and airport  Rabat is the seat of government  Tangier and Nador are the two major northern seaports on the Mediterranean  Fas is a cultural  religious and industrial center  Marrakesh and Agadir are the two major tourist centers  Oujda is the largest city of eastern Morocco  Meknas houses the military academy  Qnitra has the largest military airbase  El Muhemmadiya has the largest oil refineries and other major industrial installations   5  Education  Education in Morocco is free and compulsory through primary school  age 15   Nevertheless  many children—particularly girls in rural areas—still do not attend school  The country s illiteracy rate is usually around 50 percent for most of the country  but reaches as high as 90 percent among girls in rural regions  In July 2006  Prime minister Driss Jettou announced that illiteracy rate has declined by 39 percent  while two million people had attended literacy courses during the past four years   Morocco has about 660 000 students enrolled in 14 public universities  The oldest and among the most prestigious is Mohammed V in Rabat  with faculties of law  sciences  liberal arts  and medicine  University of Karueein  in Fez  has been a center for Islamic studies for more than 1 000 years  Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane  founded in 1993 by King Hassan II and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia  is an English medium  American style university comprising about 1 700 students   6  CIA World Factbook demographic statistics  The following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook  unless otherwise indicated   Nationality  6 1  Vital Statistics
