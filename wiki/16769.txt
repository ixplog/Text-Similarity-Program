Kim Eric Drexler  born April 25  1955  is an American engineer best known for popularizing the potential of molecular nanotechnology  MNT   from the 1970s and 1980s  His 1991 doctoral thesis at Massachusetts Institute of Technology was revised and published as the book Nanosystems  Molecular Machinery Manufacturing and Computation  1992   which received the Association of American Publishers award for Best Computer Science Book of 1992   1  Life and work  K  Eric Drexler was strongly influenced by ideas on Limits to Growth in the early 1970s  His response in his first year at Massachusetts Institute of Technology was to seek out someone who was working on extraterrestrial resources  He found Dr  Gerard K  O Neill of Princeton University  a physicist famous for a strong focus on particle accelerators and his landmark work on the concepts of space colonization  Drexler was involved in NASA summer studies in 1975 and 1976  Besides working summers for O Neill building mass driver prototypes  he delivered papers at the first three Space Manufacturing conferences at Princeton  The 1977 and 1979 papers were co authored with Keith Henson  and patents were issued on both subjects  vapor phase fabrication and space radiators   Drexler participated in NASA summer studies on space colonies in 1975 and 1976  He fabricated metal films a few tens of nanometers thick on a wax support to demonstrate the potentials of high performance solar sails  He was active in space politics  helping the L5 Society defeat the Moon Treaty in 1980   During the late 1970s  he began to develop ideas about molecular nanotechnology  MNT   In 1979  Drexler encountered Richard Feynman s provocative 1959 talk There s Plenty of Room at the Bottom  The term  nano technology  had been coined by the Tokyo Science University Professor Norio Taniguchi in 1974 to describe the precision manufacture of materials with nanometer tolerances  and Drexler unknowingly used a related term in his 1986 book Engines of Creation  The Coming Era of Nanotechnology to describe what later became known as molecular nanotechnology  MNT   In that book  he proposed the idea of a nanoscale  assembler  which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity  He also first published the term  grey goo  to describe what might happen if a hypothetical self replicating molecular nanotechnology went out of control  He has subsequently tried to clarify his concerns about out of control self replicators  and make the case that molecular manufacturing does not require such devices   Drexler holds three degrees from MIT  He received his B S  in Interdisciplinary Sciences in 1977 and his M S  in 1979 in Astro Aerospace Engineering with a Master s thesis titled  Design of a High Performance Solar Sail System   In 1991 he earned a Ph D  under the auspices of the MIT Media Lab  formally  the Media Arts and Sciences Section  School of Architecture and Planning   His Ph D  work was the first doctoral degree on the topic of molecular nanotechnology and his thesis   Molecular Machinery and Manufacturing with Applications to Computation   was published  with minor editing  as Nanosystems  Molecular Machinery  Manufacturing and Computation  1992   which received the Association of American Publishers award for Best Computer Science Book of 1992   Drexler and Christine Peterson  at that time husband and wife  founded the Foresight Institute in 1986 with the mission of  Preparing for nanotechnology ” Drexler and Peterson ended their 21 year marriage in 2002  Drexler is no longer a member of the Foresight Institute   In August 2005 Drexler joined Nanorex  a molecular engineering software company based in Bloomfield Hills  Michigan  to serve as the company s Chief Technical Advisor  Nanorex s nanoENGINEER 1 software was reportedly able to simulate a hypothetical differential gear design in  a snap    In 2006  Drexler married Rosa Wang  a former investment banker who works with Ashoka  Innovators for the Public on improving the social capital markets   2  Controversy  Drexler s work on nanotechnology was criticized as naive by Nobel Prize winner Richard Smalley in a 2001 Scientific American article  Smalley first argued that  fat fingers  made MNT impossible  He later argued that nanomachines would have to resemble chemical enzymes more than Drexler s assemblers and could only work in water  Drexler maintained that both were straw man arguments  and in the case of enzymes  wrote that  Prof  Klibanov wrote in 1994       using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles       Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond  but in December 2003  Chemical and Engineering news carried a 4 part debate  Ray Kurzweil spends four pages in his book  The Singularity Is Near   pp 236–238  to showing that Richard Smalley s arguments are not valid  and disputing them point by point  Kurzweil ends by stating that Drexler s visions are practicable and even happening already  This analysis has subsequently been put in an article online at KurzweilAI net   One of the barriers to achieving molecular nanotechnology is the lack of an efficient way to create machines on a molecular atomic scale  One of Drexler s early ideas was an  assembler   a nanomachine that would comprise an arm and a computer that could be programmed to build more nanomachines  If an assembler could be built  it might then build a copy of itself  and thus potentially be useful for efficient mass production of nanomachines  But the lack of a way to first build an assembler remains the sine qua non obstacle to achieving this vision   A second difficulty in reaching molecular nanotechnology is design  Hand design of a gear or bearing at the level of atoms is a grueling task  While Drexler  Ralph Merkle  and others have created a few designs of simple parts  no comprehensive design effort for anything approaching the complexity of a Model T Ford has been attempted   A third difficulty in achieving molecular technology is separating successful trials from failures  and elucidating the failure mechanisms of the failures  Unlike Darwinian evolution  which proceeds by random variations in ensembles of organisms combined with deterministic reproduction extinction as a selection process to achieve great complexity after billions of years  a set of mechanisms that Richard Dawkins has referred to as a  blind watchmaker    deliberate design and building of nanoscale mechanisms requires a means other than reproduction extinction to winnow successes from failures  Such means are difficult to provide  and presently non existent  for anything other than small assemblages of atoms viewable by an AFM or STM   Thus  even in the latest report  A Matter of Size  Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative  put out by the National Academies Press in December 2006   roughly twenty years after Engines of Creation was published  no clear way forward toward molecular nanotechnology is seen  as per the conclusion on page 108 of that report   3  In science fiction  Drexler is mentioned in the science fiction book The Diamond Age as one of the heroes of a future world where nanotechnology is ubiquitous   In the science fiction novel Newton s Wake by Ken Macleod a  drexler  is a nanotech assembler of pretty much anything that can fit in the volume of the particular machine   socks to starships   Drexler is also mentioned in the science fiction book Decipher by Stel Pavlou  his book is mentioned as one of the starting points of the nanomachine construction  as well as giving a better understanding of the way carbon 60 was to be applied   James Rollins references Drexler s Engines of Creation in his novel Excavation  using his theory of a molecular machine in two sections as a possible explanation for the mysterious  Substance Z  in the story   Drexler gets a mention in the late Dr  Timothy Leary s Design for Dying in the  Mutation  section  briefly detailing the 8 Circuit Consciousness model   pg  91    4  Works  Engines of Creation  1986   Available  Available online in
