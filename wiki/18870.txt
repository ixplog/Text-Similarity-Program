Minor Threat was a hardcore punk band  formed in Washington  D C  in 1980 and disbanded in 1983  The band was relatively short lived  but had a strong influence on the hardcore punk scene  both stylistically and in establishing a  do it yourself   DIY  ethic for music distribution and concert promotion  Minor Threat s song  Straight Edge  became the eventual basis of the straight edge movement  while the band often professed their own  straight edge  ideals  AllMusic described Minor Threat s music as  iconic   and noted that their groundbreaking music  has held up better than  that of  most of their contemporaries    Along with the fellow Washington  D C  hardcore band Bad Brains and California band Black Flag  Minor Threat set the standard for many hardcore punk bands in the 1980s and 1990s  All of Minor Threat s recordings were released on Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson s own label  Dischord Records  The Minor Threat EP and their only full length studio album Out of Step have received a number of accolades and are cited as landmarks of the hardcore punk genre   1  History  1 1  Formation and Early Years  Prior to forming Minor Threat in 1980  vocalist Ian MacKaye and drummer Jeff Nelson had played bass and drums respectively in The Teen Idles while attending Wilson High School  During their two year career within the flourishing Washington D C  hardcore punk scene  The Teen Idles had gained a following of around one hundred fans  a sizable amount at the time   and were seen as only second within the scene to the contemporary Bad Brains  MacKaye and Nelson were strong believers in the DIY mentality and an independent  underground music scene  After the break up of The Teen Idles  they used the money earned through the band to create Dischord Records  an independent record label that would host the releases of The Teen Idles  Minor Threat  and numerous other D C  punk bands   Eager to start a new band after The Teen Idles  MacKaye and Nelson recruited guitarist Lyle Preslar and bassist Brian Baker  They played their first performance in December 1980 to fifty people in a basement  opening for Bad Brains  The Untouchables  Black Market Baby and S O A   all D C  bands   The band s first 7  EPs  Minor Threat and In My Eyes  were released in 1981  The group became popular regionally and toured the east coast and Midwest    Straight Edge   a song from the band s first EP  helped to inspire the straight edge movement  The lyrics of the song call for abstinence from alcohol and other drugs  a novel ideology for rock musicians which initially found a small but dedicated following  Other prominent groups that subsequently advocated the straight edge stance include SS Decontrol and 7 Seconds   Another Minor Threat song from the second EP  Out of Step  further demonstrates the belief   Don t smoke Don t drink Don t fuck At least I can fucking think I can t keep up I m out of step with the world    The  I  in the lyrics was usually only implied  mainly because it did not quite fit the rhythm of the song  like the version on the 1984 album Minor Threat  The version on Out of Step is slower  allotting a bridge where MacKaye explains his philosophy of straight edge  explaining that straight edge  is not a set of rules  I m not telling you what to do  All I m saying is there are three things  that are like so important to the whole world that I don t happen to find much importance in  whether it s fucking  or whether it s playing golf  because of that  I feel     chorus    Some of the other members of Minor Threat  Jeff Nelson in particular  took exception to what they saw as MacKaye s imperious attitude on the song   Minor Threat s song  Guilty of Being White  led to some accusations of racism  but MacKaye has strongly denied such intentions and said that some listeners misinterpreted his words  He claims that his experiences attending Wilson High School  whose student population was 70 percent black  inspired the song  There  many students bullied MacKaye and his friends  Thrash metal band Slayer later covered the song  with the last iteration of the lyric  Guilty of being white  changed to  Guilty of being right   In an interview  MacKaye stated that he was offended that some perceived racist overtones in the lyrics  saying   To me  at the time and now  it seemed clear it s an anti racist song  Of course  it didn t occur to me at the time I wrote it that anybody outside of my twenty or thirty friends who I was singing to would ever have to actually ponder the lyrics or even consider them    1 2  Hiatus  In the time between the release of the band s second seven inch EP and the Out of Step record  the band briefly split when guitarist Lyle Preslar moved to Illinois to attend college for a semester at Northwestern University  Preslar was a member of Big Black for a few tempestuous rehearsals  During that period  MacKaye and Nelson put together a studio only project called Skewbald Grand Union  in a reflection of the slowly increasing disagreements between the two musicians  they were unable to decide on one name  The group recorded three untitled songs  which would be released posthumously as Dischord s 50th release  During Minor Threat s inactive period  Brian Baker also briefly played guitar for Government Issue and appeared on the Make an Effort EP   In March 1982  at the urging of Bad Brains  H R   Preslar left college to re form Minor Threat  Shortly afterwards  the cuts Minor Threat and In My Eyes were rereleased as Minor Threat in 1984  The reunited band featured an expanded lineup  Steve Hansgen joined as the band s bassist and Baker switched to second guitar   When  Out of Step  was rerecorded for the LP Out of Step  MacKaye inserted a spoken section explaining   This is not a set of rules     An ideological door had already been opened  however  and by 1982  some straight edge punks  such as followers of the band SS Decontrol  were swatting beers out of people s hands at clubs   1 3  Breakup  Minor Threat broke up in 1983  A contributing factor was disagreement over musical direction  MacKaye was allegedly skipping practice sessions towards the end of the band s career  and he wrote the lyrics to the songs on the Salad Days EP in the studio  That was quite a contrast with the earlier recordings  as he had written and co written the music for much of the band s early material  Minor Threat  which had returned to being a four piece group with the departure of Hansgen  played its last show on September 23  1983  with go go band Trouble Funk and the Big Boys at the Lansburgh Cultural Center in Washington  D C  They ended their set with  Last Song   which was the original title of  Salad Days    Alternatively  MacKaye stated that he did not  check out  on hardcore  but in fact hardcore  checked out   Explaining this  he stated that at a 1984 Minutemen show  a fan struck MacKaye s younger brother Alec in the face  and he punched the fan back  then realizing that the violence was  stupid   and that he saw his role in the stupidity  MacKaye claimed that immediately after this he decided to leave the hardcore scene   1 4  Subsequent activities  MacKaye went on to found Embrace with former members of The Faith  the obscure Egg Hunt with Jeff Nelson and later Fugazi and The Evens  as well as collaborating on Pailhead   Brian Baker went on to play in Junkyard  The Meatmen  Dag Nasty and Government Issue  He currently plays in Bad Religion   Lyle Preslar was briefly a member of Glenn Danzig s Samhain  and his playing appears on a few songs on the band s first record  He joined The Meatmen in 1984  along with fellow Minor Threat member Brian Baker  He later ran Caroline Records  signing and working with  among others  Peter Gabriel  Ben Folds  Chemical Brothers  and Idaho  and ran marketing for Sire Records  He graduated from Rutgers University law school and lives in New Jersey   Jeff Nelson played less frantic alternative rock with Three and The High Back Chairs before retiring from live performance  He runs his own label  Adult Swim Records  distributed by Dischord  and is a graphic artist and a political activist in Toledo  Ohio  The band s own Dischord Records released material by many bands from the Washington  D C   area  such as Government Issue  Void  Scream  Fugazi  Artificial Peace  Rites of Spring  Gray Matter  and Dag Nasty  and has become a respected independent record label   Steve Hansgen formed Second Wind with Minor Threat roadie Untouchables drummer Rich Moore  He also worked with Tool in 1992 on the production of their first EP  Opiate   2  Copyright issues  2 1   Major Threat   In 2005  a mock up of the cover of Minor Threat s first EP  also used on the Minor Threat LP and Complete Discography CD  was copied by athletic footwear manufacturer Nike for use on a promotional poster for a skateboarding tour called  Major Threat   Nike also altered Minor Threat s logo  designed by Jeff Nelson  for the same campaign  as well as featuring Nike shoes in the new picture  rather than the combat boots worn by Ian MacKaye s younger brother Alec on the original   MacKaye issued a press statement condemning Nike s actions and said that he would discuss legal options with the other members of the band  Meanwhile  fans  at the encouragement of Dischord  organized a letter writing campaign protesting Nike s infringement  On June 27  2005  Nike issued a statement apologizing to Minor Threat  Dischord Records  and their fans for the  Major Threat  campaign and said that all promotional artwork  print and digital  that they could acquire were destroyed   2 2   Salad Days   On October 29  2005  Fox played the first few seconds of Minor Threat s  Salad Days  during an NFL broadcast  Use of the song was not cleared by Dischord Records or any of the members of Minor Threat  Fox claimed that the clip was too short to have violated any copyrights   2 3  Wheelhouse Pickles  In 2007  Brooklyn based company Wheelhouse Pickles marketed a pepper sauce named  Minor Threat Sauce   Requesting only that the original label design  which was based on the  Bottled Violence  artwork  be amended  Ian MacKaye gave the product his endorsement  A small mention of this was made in music magazine Revolver  where MacKaye commented  I don t really like hot sauce but I like the Minor Threat stuff    3  Members  Ian MacKaye – lead vocals  1980–1983   Lyle Preslar – guitar  1980–1983   Brian Baker – bass  1980–1982  1983   guitar  1982–1983   Jeff Nelson – drums
