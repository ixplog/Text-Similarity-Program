Transverse myelitis  Latin  myelitis transversa  is a neurological condition in which the spinal cord is inflamed  This inflammation damages nerve fibers  and causes them to lose their myelin coating  thereby leading to decreased electrical conductivity in the nervous system  The disorder s name is derived from Greek referring to the  spinal cord   and the suffix  itis  which denotes inflammation  Transverse implies that the inflammation is across the thickness of the spinal cord   1  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms include weakness and numbness of the limbs deficits in sensation and motor skills  dysfunctional sphincter activities  and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system  Symptoms typically develop occur over the course of hours or days and may progress after weeks  Sensory symptoms of transverse myelitis may include a sensation of pins and needles traveling up from the feet  Back pain can occur at the level of the inflamed segment of the spinal cord  The degree and type of sensory loss will depend upon the extent of the involvement of the various sensory tracts  but there is often a  sensory level   at the sensory segmental level of the spinal cord below which sensation to pain or light touch is impaired   Motor weakness occurs due to involvement of the pyramidal tracts and mainly affects the muscles that flex the legs and extend the arms  Involvement of the autonomic nervous system is common and frequently leads to impaired function of the bladder and bowel and can also lead to episodes of high blood pressure  Bladder paralysis often occurs and urinary retention is an early manifestation   If the upper cervical cord is involved  all four limbs may be involved and there is risk of respiratory paralysis  segments C3  4  5 to the abdominal diaphragm    Lesions of the lower cervical  C5–T1  region will cause a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the upper limbs  and exclusively upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs   A lesion of the thoracic spinal cord  T1–12  will produce upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs  presenting as a spastic diplegia   A lesion of the lower part of the spinal cord  L1–S5  often produces a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the lower limbs   2  Causes  Transverse myelitis can appear for several reasons  Sometimes the disorders classified as such can be referred to as  Transverse myelitis spectrum disorders   In some cases  the disease is presumed to be caused by viral infections such as cytomegalovirus  CMV  and has also been associated with spinal cord injuries  immune reactions  schistosomiasis and insufficient blood flow through spinal cord vessels  Acute myelitis accounts for 4 to 5 percent of all cases of neuroborreliosis   A major differentiation or distinction to be made is a similar condition due to compression of the spinal cord in the spinal canal  due to disease of the surrounding vertebral column   Another possible cause is dissection of the aorta  extending into one or more of the spinal arteries   Transverse myelitis can be a rare complication following cat scratch disease  It can also be associated with   Bacterial Infections   Mycoplasma pneumoniae  Lyme borreliosis  syphilis  tabes dorsalis   tuberculosis  Viral Infections   herpes simplex  herpes zoster  cytomegalovirus  Epstein Barr virus  enteroviruses  poliomyelitis  Coxsackie virus  echovirus   human T cell  leukemia virus  human immunodeficiency virus  influenza  rabies  Post Vaccination   Rabies  cowpox  Multiple sclerosis  Paraneoplastic syndromes  Vascular   thrombosis of spinal arteries  vasculitis secondary to heroin abuse  spinal arteriovenous malformations  3  Pathophysiology  This demyelination arises idiopathically following infections or due to multiple sclerosis  and has been reported to occur following vaccination   One major theory posits that immune mediated inflammation is present as the result of exposure to a viral antigen  The diarrhea causing bacteria Campylobacter jejuni is also a reported cause of transverse myelitis   The lesions are inflammatory  and involve the spinal cord typically on both sides  With acute transverse myelitis  the onset is sudden and progresses rapidly in hours and days  The lesions can be present anywhere in the spinal cord  though they are usually restricted to only a small portion   A special case is the  longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis   LETM  which is defined as a spinal cord lesion that extends over 3 or more vertebral segments   4  Differential diagnosis  The symptoms considered in the differential diagnosis are  acute spinal cord trauma  acute compressive lesions of the spinal cord such as epidural metastatic tumour  and infarction of the spinal cord  usually due to insufficiency of the anterior spinal artery  Lyme disease serology is indicated in patients with transverse myelitis keeping in mind that dissociation in Lyme antibody titers between the blood and the CSF is possible   From the symptoms and signs  it may be very difficult to distinguish acute transverse myelitis from these conditions and it is almost invariably necessary to perform an emergency magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  scan or computerised tomographic  CT  myelogram  Before doing this  routine x rays are taken of the entire spine  mainly to detect signs of metastatic disease of the vertebrae  that would imply direct extension into the epidural space and compression of the spinal cord  Often  such bony lesions are absent and it is only the MRI or CT that discloses the presence or absence of a compressive lesion   A family physician seeing such a patient for the first time should immediately arrange transfer to the care of a neurologist or neurosurgeon who can urgently investigate the patient in hospital  Before arranging this transfer  the physician should be certain that respiration is not affected  particularly in high spinal cord lesions  If there is any evidence of this  methods of respiratory assistance must be on hand before and during the transfer procedure  The patient should also be catheterized to test for and  if necessary  drain an over distended bladder  A lumbar puncture can be performed after the MRI or at the time of CT myelography  Steroids are often given in high dose at the onset  in hope that the degree of inflammation and swelling of the cord will be lessened  but whether this is truly effective is still debated   The prognosis for significant recovery from acute transverse myelitis is poor in approximately 66% of the cases  that is  significant long term disability will remain  Approximately 2% of these patients will  in later months or years  show lesions in other parts of the central nervous system  indicating  in retrospect  that this was a first attack of multiple sclerosis   5  Prognosis  Recovery from transverse myelitis is variable between individuals and also depends on the underlying cause  Some patients begin to recover between weeks 2 and 12 following onset and may continue to improve for up to 2 years  Other patients may never show signs of recovery  However  if treated early  some patients experience complete or near complete recovery  Treatment options also vary according to the underlying cause and one treatment option in some cases is plasmapheresis   6
