Roxy Music were a British art rock group formed in 1971 by Bryan Ferry  who became the group s lead vocalist and chief songwriter  and bassist Graham Simpson  Alongside Ferry  the other longtime members were Phil Manzanera  guitar   Andy Mackay  saxophone and oboe  and Paul Thompson  drums and percussion   and other former members include Brian Eno  synthesiser and  treatments    Eddie Jobson  synthesiser and violin   and John Gustafson  bass   Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983  they reunited for a concert tour in 2001  and toured together intermittently between that time and their break up in 2014  Ferry frequently enlisted many Roxy members as session musicians for his solo releases   Roxy Music attained popular and critical success in Europe and Australia during the 1970s and early 1980s  beginning with their debut album  Roxy Music  1972   The band was highly influential  as leading proponents of the more experimental  musically sophisticated element of glam  as well as a significant influence on early English punk music  They also provided a model for many new wave acts and the experimental electronic groups of the early 1980s  The group is distinguished by their visual and musical sophistication and their preoccupation with style and glamour  Ferry and co founding member Eno have also had influential solo careers  the latter becoming one of the most significant record producers and collaborators of the late 20th century  Rolling Stone magazine ranked Roxy Music No  98 on its  The Immortals 舑 100 The Greatest Artists of All Time  list   Their music was influenced by other British artists  such as The Beatles  The Rolling Stones  The Kinks  The Who  The Pretty Things  Pink Floyd  The Creation  The Move  Traffic  David Bowie  King Crimson  and Elton John  as well as American artists like Little Richard  Elvis Presley and The Velvet Underground   The band s last studio album was 1982 s Avalon  In 2005 they began recording a new studio album  which would have been their ninth  and would have been their first record since 1973 with Brian Eno  who wrote two songs for it and also played keyboards  However  Bryan Ferry eventually confirmed that material from these sessions would be released as a Ferry solo album  with Eno playing on  a couple of tracks   and that he doesn t think they ll ever record as Roxy Music again  The album ultimately became Ferry s 2010 album Olympia   Roxy Music played a series of 40th anniversary shows in 2011  then became inactive as a performing entity  It was announced on 3 November 2014 that the group had officially split up   1  History  1 1  Formation and early years  1970–71   In November 1970  Bryan Ferry  who had recently lost his job teaching ceramics at a girls  school for holding impromptu record listening sessions  advertised for a keyboard player to collaborate with him and Graham Simpson  a bass player he knew from his Newcastle art college band  the Gas Board  and with whom he collaborated on his first songs  In early 1970 Ferry had auditioned as lead singer for King Crimson  who were seeking a replacement for departed vocalist Greg Lake  Although Robert Fripp and Pete Sinfield decided that Ferry s voice was unsuitable for King Crimson s material  they were impressed with his talent and helped the fledgling Roxy Music to obtain a contract with E G  Records   Andy Mackay replied to Ferry s advertisement  not as a keyboard player but a saxophonist and oboist  though he did have a VCS3 synthesizer  Mackay had already met Brian Eno during university days  as both were interested in avant garde and electronic music  Although Eno was a non musician  he could operate a synthesizer and owned a Revox reel to reel tape machine  so Mackay convinced him to join the band as a technical adviser  Before long Eno was an official member of the group  When founding drummer Dexter Lloyd  a classically trained timpanist  left the band  an advertisement was placed in Melody Maker saying  wonder drummer wanted for an avant rock group   Paul Thompson responded to the advertisement and joined the band in June 1971  The group s name was partly an homage to the titles of old cinemas and dance halls  and partly a pun on the word rock  Ferry had named the band Roxy originally  but after learning of an American band with the same name he changed the name to Roxy Music   In October 1971 Roxy advertised in Melody Maker seeking the  Perfect Guitarist  and Phil Manzanera was one of about twenty players who auditioned  Manzanera  the son of an English father and a Colombian mother  had spent a considerable amount of time in South America and Cuba as a child and although he did not have the same art school background as Ferry  Mackay and Eno  he was perhaps the most proficient member of the band  with an interest in a wide variety of music  Manzanera also knew other well known musicians  such as David Gilmour  who was a friend of his older brother  and Soft Machine s Robert Wyatt  However  Manzanera did not initially make the band as a guitarist  the successful applicant was David O List  former guitarist with The Nice  The group was impressed enough with Manzanera that he was invited to become Roxy Music s roadie  an offer which he accepted   The band s fortunes were greatly increased by the support of Melody Maker journalist Richard Williams and broadcaster John Peel  Williams became an enthusiastic fan after meeting Ferry and being given a demonstration tape during mid 1971  and wrote the first major article on the band  featured on Melody Maker s  Horizons  page in 7 August 1971 edition  This line up of Roxy Music  Ferry Mackay Eno Simpson Thompson O List  recorded a BBC session shortly thereafter   1 2  First two albums  1972–1973   In early February 1972  guitarist O List quit the group abruptly after an altercation with Paul Thompson which took place at their audition for David Enthoven of EG Management  When O List didn t show up for the next rehearsal  Manzanera was asked to come along  on the pretext of becoming the band s sound mixer  When he arrived he was invited to play guitar and quickly realised that it was an informal audition  Unbeknownst to the rest of the group  Manzanera had learned their entire repertoire and as a result  he was immediately hired as O List s permanent replacement  joining on 14 February 1972  Two weeks later Roxy Music signed with EG Management   With this team  EG Management financed the recording of the tracks for their first album  Roxy Music  recorded in March–April 1972 and produced by King Crimson lyricist Peter Sinfield  Both the album and its famous cover artwork were apparently completed before the group signed with Island Records  A&R staffer Tim Clark records that although he argued strongly that Island should contract them  company boss Chris Blackwell at first seemed unimpressed and Clark assumed he was not interested  A few days later however  Clark and Enthoven were standing in the hallway of the Island offices examining cover images for the album when Blackwell walked past  glanced at the artwork and said  Looks great  Have we got them signed yet   The band signed with Island Records a few days later  The LP was released in June to good reviews and became a major success  reaching No  10 on the UK album chart in September 1972   During the first half of 1972 bassist Graham Simpson became increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative  which led to his leaving the band almost immediately after the recording of the debut album  He was replaced first by Peter Paul  then by Rik Kenton   To bring more attention to their album  Roxy Music decided to record and release a single  Their debut single was  Virginia Plain   which scored No  4 in the British charts  The band s eclectic visual image  captured in their debut performance on the BBC s Top of the Pops  became a cornerstone for the glam trend in the UK  the TOTP video of  Virginia Plain  was later parodied by the British comedy series Big Train  The single caused a renewed interest in the album  Soon after  Virginia Plain   Rik Kenton departed the band  which would never again have a permanent bass player  John Porter  John Gustafson  John Wetton  Gary Tibbs  Alan Spenner and Neil Jason among others would fill the revolving role   The next album  For Your Pleasure  was released in March 1973  It marked the beginning of the band s long  successful collaboration with producer Chris Thomas  who worked on all of the group s classic albums and singles in the 1970s  The album was promoted with the non album single  Pyjamarama   no album track was released as a single  At the time  Ferry was dating French model Amanda Lear  who was photographed with a black jaguar for the front cover of the album  Ferry appears on the back cover as a dapper chauffeur standing in front of a limousine   John Porter  credited as a guest  played bass on the record  while Sal Maida played bass for subsequent live shows   1 3  Stranded  Country Life  Siren  and solo projects  1973–77   Soon after recording For Your Pleasure  Brian Eno left Roxy Music amidst increasing differences with Ferry about the management of the group  The other members of the band are reported to have shared some of Eno s concerns about Ferry s dominance  but they elected to remain  Also  Johnny Gustafson became the band s permanent bass player for the next three studio albums  but not always for live shows  though he toured with Roxy on certain dates in 1973 and 1975  other live Roxy bassists of this period  1973–1976  included Sal Maida  John Wetton and Rick Wills   Eno  meanwhile  was replaced by a 19 year old multi instrumentalist Eddie Jobson  formerly of progressive rockers Curved Air  who played keyboards and electric violin  Although some fans lamented the loss of the experimental attitude and camp aesthetic that Eno had brought to the band  the classically trained Jobson was an accomplished musician  Eno himself later acknowledged the quality of the two albums that followed his departure  Stranded  1973  and Country Life  1974   and they are widely regarded as being among the most original and consistent British rock music albums of the period  Rolling Stone referred to the albums as marking  the zenith of contemporary British art rock    The songs on these albums also cemented Ferry s persona as the epitome of the suave  jaded Euro sophisticate  Although this persona undoubtedly began as a deliberately ironic device  during the mid 1970s it seemed to merge with Ferry s real life  as the working class miner s son from the north of England became an international rock star  an icon of male style who had love affairs with many beautiful women  among them Playboy playmate Marilyn Cole  who appeared on the cover of the Stranded album  and fashion models Amanda Lear  who would later date David Bowie  and Jerry Hall  who later became the common law wife of Mick Jagger    On the first two Roxy albums  all songs were written solely by Bryan Ferry  Beginning with Stranded  Mackay and Manzanera began to co write some material  Gradually  their songwriting and musicianship became more integrated into the band s sound  although Ferry remained the dominant songwriter  throughout their career  all but one of Roxy s singles were written either wholly or jointly by Ferry   However  Manzanera  Mackay and Thompson did individually write a few of the band s B sides   Stranded was released in November 1973  and produced the top 10 single  Street Life    The fourth album  Country Life  was released in 1974  and was the first Roxy Music album to enter the U S  Top 40  albeit at No  37  Country Life was met with widespread critical acclaim  with Rolling Stone referring to it  as if Ferry ran a cabaret for psychotics  featuring chanteurs in a state of shock   Their fifth album  Siren  contained their only U S  hit   Love Is the Drug    Ferry said the song came to him while kicking the leaves during a walk through Hyde Park   At this time Ferry was involved in a relationship with Texas born supermodel Jerry Hall  Ferry s paean to Hall   Prairie Rose   directly inspired the Talking Heads song  The Big Country  and was later covered by the Scottish rock group Big Country as a B side to their single  East of Eden  in 1984  Hall is also featured on the cover of the Siren LP and in the video for Ferry s 1976 international solo success  a cover of Wilbert Harrison s  Let s Stick Together    After the concert tours in support of Siren in 1976  Roxy Music disbanded  Their live album Viva  was released in August 1976  During this time Ferry released two solo records on which Manzanera and Thompson performed  and Manzanera reunited with Eno on the critically acclaimed one off 801 Live album   1 4  Final albums and hiatus  1978–83   Roxy Music reunited during 1978 to record a new album  Manifesto  but with a reshuffled cast  Jobson was not present  and was reportedly not contacted for the reunion   At that time  Jobson was touring and recording with his own band  UK   The sleeve of Manifesto explicitly identifies the revived Roxy Music line up as a septet of Ferry  Manzanera  Mackay  Thompson  and new members Gary Tibbs  bass   Alan Spenner  bass  and Paul Carrack  keyboards   However  these newest three members were downgraded to session musician status  as opposed to full band members  on all subsequent releases   Three singles were spun off from Manifesto  including the major UK hits  Angel Eyes   UK No  4   and  Dance Away   UK No  2   Both these tracks are significantly different from the album versions  as  Dance Away  was remixed for single release  and  Angel Eyes  was entirely re recorded   After the tour and before the recording of the next album  Flesh + Blood  1980   Thompson broke his thumb in a motorcycle mishap and took a leave from the band  Soon after  he left permanently   At this point  Ferry  Mackay and Manzanera became the only permanent members of Roxy Music  and were supplemented by a variety of session players over the next few years  including Tibbs  Spenner  Carrack  Andy Newmark and Neil Hubbard   The trio s 1980 album Flesh + Blood became a huge commercial success in their homeland  as the album went to No  1 on the UK charts  and spun off three UK hits   Oh Yeah   UK No  5    Over You   UK No  5   and  Same Old Scene   UK No  12    However  the changed cast reflected a distinct change in Roxy s musical style  Gone were the unpredictable elements of the group s sound  giving way to smoother musical arrangements  Rolling Stone panned Manifesto   Roxy Music has not gone disco  Roxy Music has not particularly gone anywhere else either   as well as Flesh + Blood   such a shockingly bad Roxy Music record that it provokes a certain fascination    while other sources praised the reunion  Melody Maker said  of Manifesto      reservations aside  this may be the first such return bout ever attempted with any degree of genuine success  a technical knockout against the odds    In 1981  Roxy Music recorded the non album single  Jealous Guy   A cover of a song written and originally recorded by John Lennon  Roxy Music recorded  Jealous Guy  as a tribute to Lennon after his 1980 death  The song topped the UK charts for two weeks in March 1981  becoming the band s only No  1 single   Later  with more sombre and carefully sculpted soundscapes  the band s eighth—and final—studio album  Avalon  1982   recorded at Chris Blackwell s Compass Point Studios  was a major commercial success and restored the group s critical reputation and contained the successful single  More Than This   The album also included several Roxy Music classics  such as  Avalon    The Main Thing    The Space Between   and  True to Life   The trio  augmented by session players  toured extensively until 1983  when Bryan Ferry dissolved the band and band members devoted themselves full time to solo careers  see below    1 5  Reunions and split  2001–2014   Ferry  Manzanera  Mackay  and Thompson re formed in 2001 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band and toured extensively  A festival performance in Portugal and a short tour of the United States followed in 2003  Absent was Brian Eno  who criticised the motives of the band s reunion  saying   I just don t like the idea  It leaves a bad taste   Later Eno remarked that his comment had been taken out of context  Manzanera and Thompson recorded and toured with Ferry on his 2002 album Frantic  Eno also contributed to Frantic on the track  I Thought    During 2002  Image Entertainment  Inc   released the concert DVD Roxy Music Live at the Apollo featuring performances of 20 songs plus interviews and rehearsal footage   In 2004  Rolling Stone magazine ranked the group No  98 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time   Roxy Music gave a live performance at the 2005 Isle of Wight Festival on 11 June 2005  their first UK concert since the 2001–2002 world tour  On 2 July 2005  the band played  Jealous Guy    Do the Strand   and  Love is the Drug  at the Berlin contribution to Live8   Do the Strand  is available on the 4 disc DVD collection  whereas  Love Is the Drug  can be found on the Live 8 Berlin DVD   In March 2005  it was announced on Phil Manzanera s official site that the band  including Brian Eno  had decided to record an album of new material  The project would mark the first time Eno worked with Roxy Music since 1973 s For Your Pleasure  After a number of denials that he would be involved with any Roxy Music reunion  on 19 May 2006 Eno revealed that he had contributed two songs to the new album as well as playing keyboards on other tracks  He did  however  rule out touring with the band  Had the record been released as a Roxy Music album  it would have been the first album since Manifesto on which original drummer Paul Thompson performed  The album has  however  been released as a Bryan Ferry solo album entitled Olympia   During early 2006  a lesser known Roxy track   The Main Thing   was remixed by Malcolm Green and used as the soundtrack to a pan European television commercial for the Opel Vectra featuring celebrated football referee Pierluigi Collina   During July 2006  the band toured Europe  They concentrated mostly on places they had never visited before  such as Serbia and Macedonia  Roxy Music s second drummer  Andy Newmark  performed during the tour  as Thompson withdrew due to health issues  and Oliver Thompson  guitar  made his first appearance with the band   During a March 2007 interview with the Western Daily Press  Ferry confirmed that although the next Roxy Music album is definitely being made  it would not be vended for another  year and a half   as Ferry had just released and toured behind his twelfth studio album  Dylanesque  consisting of Bob Dylan covers   In June 2007  the band hired a Liverpool based design agency to develop their new website supporting their new album  Early in the year  Phil Manzanera revealed that the band were planning to sign a record contract  During an October 2007 interview  Ferry said that the album would include a collaboration with Scissor Sisters   Over the summer of 2010  Roxy Music headlined at various festivals across the world  including Lovebox at London s Victoria Park  Electric Picnic in Stradbally  Co  Laois  Ireland  and Bestival on the Isle of Wight  Thompson missed three dates of the tour due to illness  and was once more replaced by Andy Newmark  However  Thompson returned for the band s Bestival set   Roxy Music performed seven dates around the UK in January and February 2011  in a tour billed  For Your Pleasure   to celebrate the band s 40th anniversary  They then toured Australia and New Zealand between February and March for a further eight shows  These are the final Roxy Music live performances to date   Virgin Records released a box set entitled Roxy Music  The Complete Studio Recordings 1972 1982 on 6 August 2012  celebrating 40 years since the release of the band s debut album in 1972  Further reissues are expected to follow   In an interview given to Rolling Stone on 3 November 2014  Phil Manzanera stated that Roxy Music have split up   2  Style and legacy  The early style and presentation of Roxy Music was influenced by the art school backgrounds of its principal members  Ferry  Mackay and Eno all had studied at prominent UK art colleges during the mid to late 1960s  when these institutions were introducing courses that avoided traditional art teaching practice  with its emphasis on painting  and instead focused on more recent developments  most notably pop art  and explored new concepts such as cybernetics  As writer Michael Bracewell notes in his book Roxy  the band that invented an era  Roxy Music was created expressly by Ferry  Mackay and Eno as a means of combining their mutual interests in music  modern art and fashion   Ferry studied at the Newcastle University in the Sixties under renowned pop artist and educator Richard Hamilton  and many of Ferry s university friends  classmates and tutors   e g  Rita Donagh and Tim Head   became well known artists in their own right  Eno studied at Winchester School of Art and although his iconoclastic style became apparent early and caused some conflict with the college establishment  it also resulted in him meeting important artists and musicians including Cornelius Cardew and Gavin Bryars  His interest in electronic music also resulted in his first meetings with Andy Mackay  who was studying at Reading University and who had likewise developed a strong interest in avant garde and electronic music   The three eventually joined forces in London during 1970–71 after meeting through mutual friends and decided to form a rock band   Roxy Music was one of the first rock music groups to create and maintain a carefully crafted look and style that included their stage presentation  music videos  album and single cover designs  and promotional materials such as posters  handbills  cards and badges  They were assisted in this by a group of friends and associates who helped to sculpt the classic Roxy Music  look   notably fashion designer Antony Price  hair stylist Keith Mainwaring  photographer Karl Stoecker  the group s  PR consultant  Simon Puxley  a former university friend of Mackay s  and Ferry s art school classmate Nicholas De Ville  Well known critic Lester Bangs went so far as to say that Roxy represented  the triumph of artifice    The band s debut album  produced by King Crimson s Pete Sinfield  was the first in a series of increasingly sophisticated album covers  art directed by Ferry in collaboration with his friend Nick De Ville  The album artwork imitated the visual style of classic  girlie  and fashion magazines  featuring high fashion shots of scantily clad models Amanda Lear  Marilyn Cole and Jerry Hall  each of whom had romances with Ferry during the time of their contributions  as well as model Kari Ann Muller who appears on the cover of the first Roxy album but who was not otherwise involved with anyone in the band  and who later married Mick Jagger s brother Chris  The title of the fourth Roxy album  Country Life  was intended as a parody of the well known British rural magazine of the same name  and the visually punning front cover photo featured two models  two German fans  Constanze Karoli—sister of Can s Michael Karoli—and Eveline Grunwald  clad only in semi transparent lingerie standing in a forest  As a result  in many areas of the United States the album was sold in an opaque plastic wrapper because retailers refused to display the cover  Later  an alternative cover  featuring just a picture of the forest  was used   The English group Madness are among the artists that have cited Roxy Music as an influence and have paid tribute to Bryan Ferry in the song  4BF   the title is a reference to the song  2HB   itself a tribute to Humphrey Bogart from the first Roxy Music album   Other artists who have claimed Roxy Music as an influence include David Bowie  Steve Jones and Paul Cook of The Sex Pistols  Siouxsie and the Banshees  The Cars  Grace Jones  Kate Bush  Adam Ant  The Human League  Japan  Duran Duran  Simple Minds  ABC  Spandau Ballet  The Fixx  Depeche Mode  Men Without Hats  Nile Rodgers  Annie Lennox  Morrissey  Jarvis Cocker and Neil Hannon   In 1997 John Taylor of Duran Duran produced the tribute album Dream Home Heartaches    Remaking Remodeling Roxy Music  The compilation features Taylor as well as Dave Gahan  Depeche Mode  and Low Pop Suicide  among others   The British electronic band Ladytron took their name from the title of a Roxy Music song from their debut album   3  Members  Bryan Ferry – vocals  keyboards  1971–1983  2001–2014   Graham Simpson – bass  1971–1972  died
