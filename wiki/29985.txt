An early appearance of a description of the taco in the United States in English was in a 1914 cookbook  California Mexican Spanish Cookbook  by Bertha Haffner Ginger  The style that has become most common is the hard shell  U shaped version described in a cookbook  The good life  New Mexican food  authored by Fabiola Cabeza de Vaca Gilbert and published in Santa Fe  New Mexico in 1949  These have been sold by restaurants and by fast food chains  Even non Mexican oriented fast food restaurants have sold tacos  Mass production of this type of taco was encouraged by the invention of devices to hold the tortillas in the U shape as they were deep fried  A patent for such a device was issued to New York restaurateur Juvenico Maldonado in 1950  based on his patent filing of 1947  U S  Patent No  2 506 305   Such tacos are crisp fried corn tortillas filled with seasoned ground beef  cheese  lettuce  and sometimes tomato  onion  salsa  sour cream  and avocado or guacamole   4 2  Soft shell tacos  Traditionally  soft shelled tacos referred to corn tortillas that were cooked to a softer state than a hard taco   usually by grilling or steaming  More recently the term has come to include flour tortilla based tacos mostly from large manufacturers and restaurant chains  In this context  soft tacos are tacos made with wheat flour tortillas and filled with the same ingredients as a hard taco   4 3  Crispy tacos  A mostly California variation where the  sometimes over sized  corn tortilla is fried or deep fried in oil  originally  lard   The meat can be anything  such as ground beef  steak  shredded beef  chicken or pork  carnitas   Ground beef is generally diluted with refried bean paste and or potato  and heavily seasoned  Steak will usually be heavily chili marinated  diced beef tip   asada    The meat is generally topped with jack and or cheddar cheese  lettuce and tomato  and sometimes avocado and or sour cream   with salsa on top   4 4  Puffy tacos  taco kits  breakfast tacos and tacodillas  Since at least 1978  a variation called the  puffy taco  has been popular  Henry s Puffy Tacos  opened by Henry Lopez in San Antonio  Texas  claims to have invented the variation  in which uncooked corn tortillas  flattened balls of masa dough  are quickly fried in hot oil until they expand and become  puffy   Fillings are similar to hard shell versions  Restaurants offering this style of taco have since appeared in other Texas cities  as well as in California  where Henry s brother  Arturo Lopez  opened Arturo s Puffy Taco in Whittier  not long after Henry s opened  Henry s continues to thrive  managed by the family s second generation   Kits are available at grocery and convenience stores and usually consist of taco shells  corn tortillas already fried in a U shape   seasoning mix and taco sauce  Commercial vendors for the home market also market soft taco kits with tortillas instead of taco shells   The breakfast taco  found in Tex Mex cuisine  is a soft corn or flour tortilla filled with meat  eggs  or cheese  with other ingredients   The tacodilla contains melted cheese in between the two folded tortillas  thus resembling a quesadilla   4 5  Indian tacos  Indian tacos  sometimes known as Navajo tacos but served in various parts of the American West and Midwest  are made using frybread instead of tortillas  They are commonly served at pow wows  festivals  and other gatherings   File Puffy taco jpg A puffy taco File Frybread taco jpg A frybread taco  5  See also  Burrito  Choco Taco  Fajita  Korean taco  List of maize dishes  List of
