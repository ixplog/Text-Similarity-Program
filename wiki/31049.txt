Time transfer is a scheme where multiple sites share a precise reference time  Time transfer solves problems such as astronomical observatories correlating observed flashes or other phenomena with each other  as well as cell phone towers coordinating handoffs as a phone moves from one cell to another   Multiple techniques have been developed  often transferring reference clock synchronization from one point to another  often over long distances  Accuracy approaching one nanosecond worldwide is economically practical for many applications  Radio based navigation systems are frequently used as time transfer systems   In some cases  multiple measurements are made over a period of time  and exact time synchronization is determined retrospectively  In particular  time synchronization has been accomplished by using pairs of radio telescopes to listen to a pulsar  with the time transfer accomplished by comparing time offsets of the received pulsar signal   1  One way  In a one way time transfer system  one end transmits its current time over some communication channel to one or more receivers  The receivers will  at reception  decode the message  and either just report the time  or adjust a local clock which can provide hold over time reports in between the reception of messages  The advantage of one way systems is that they can be technically simple and serve many receivers  as the transmitter is unaware of the receivers   The principal drawback of the one way time transfer system is that propagation delays of the communication channel remain uncompensated except in some advanced systems  Examples of a one way time transfer system are the clock on a church or town building and the ringing of their time indication bells  time balls  radio clock signals such as LORAN  DCF77 and MSF  and finally the Global Positioning System which uses multiple one way time transfers from different satellites  with positional information and other advanced means of delay compensations to allow receiver compensation of time and position information in real time   2  Two way  In a two way time transfer system  the two peers will both transmit  and will also receive each other s messages  thus performing two one way time transfers to determine the difference between the remote clock and the local clock  The sum of these time differences is the round trip delay between the two nodes  It is often assumed that this delay is evenly distributed between the directions between the peers  Under this assumption  half the round trip delay is the propagation delay to be compensated  A drawback is that the two way propagation delay must be measured and used to calculate a delay correction  That function can be implemented in the reference source  in which case the source capacity limits the number of slaves that can be served  or by software in each slave  The NIST provides a time reference service to computer users on the Internet  based on Java applets loaded by each slave  The two way satellite time and frequency transfer  TWSTFT  system being used in comparison among some time laboratories uses a satellite for a common link between the laboratories  The Network Time Protocol uses packet based messages over an IP network   3  Common view  The time difference between two clocks may be determined by simultaneously comparing each clock to a common reference signal that may be received at both sites  As long as both end stations receive the same satellite signal at the same time  the accuracy of the signal source is not important  The nature of the received signal is not important  although widely available timing and navigation systems such as GPS or LORAN are convenient   The accuracy of time transferred in this way is typically 1â€“10 ns   4  Time standard  Since the advent of the Global Positioning System  highly precise  yet affordable timing is available from many commercial GPS receivers  Its initial system design expected general timing precision better than 340 nanoseconds using low grade  coarse mode  and 200 ns in precision mode  A GPS receiver functions by precisely measuring the transit time of signals received from several satellites  These distances combined geometrically with precise orbital information identify the location of the receiver  Precise timing is fundamental to an accurate GPS location  The time from an atomic clock on board each satellite is encoded into the radio signal  the receiver determines how much later it received the signal than it was sent  To do this  a local clock is corrected to the GPS atomic clock time by solving for three dimensions and time based on four or more satellite signals  Improvements in algorithms lead many modern low cost GPS receivers to achieve better than 10 meter accuracy  which implies a timing accuracy of about 30 ns  GPS based laboratory time references routinely achieve 10 ns precision   5  See also  International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems
