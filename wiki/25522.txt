The early history of radio is the history of technology that produced radio instruments that use radio waves  Within the timeline of radio  many people contributed theory and inventions in what became radio  Radio development began as  wireless telegraphy   Later radio history increasingly involves matters of programming and content   1  Summary  1 1  19th century  The meaning and usage of the word  radio  has developed in parallel with developments within the field of communications and can be seen to have three distinct phases  electromagnetic waves and experimentation  wireless communication and technical development  and radio broadcasting and commercialization  James Clerk Maxwell predicted the propagation of electromagnetic waves  radio waves   1873  and Heinrich Rudolf Hertz made the first demonstration of transmission of radio waves through free space  1887  but many individuals—inventors  engineers  developers and businessmen constructed systems based on their own understanding of these and other phenomenon  some predating Maxwell and Hertz  discoveries  Thus  wireless telegraphy  and radio wave based systems can be attributed to multiple  inventors   Development from a laboratory demonstration to a commercial entity spanned several decades and required the efforts of many practitioners   In 1878  David E  Hughes noticed that sparks could be heard in a telephone receiver when experimenting with his carbon microphone  He developed this carbon based detector further and eventually could detect signals over a few hundred yards  He demonstrated his discovery to the Royal Society in 1880  but was told it was merely induction  and therefore abandoned further research   Experiments were undertaken by Thomas Edison and his employees at Menlo Park  Edison applied in 1885 to the U S  Patent Office for a patent on an electrostatic coupling system between elevated terminals  The patent was granted as on December 29  1891  The Marconi Company would later purchase rights to the Edison patent to protect them legally from lawsuits   In 1884 Temistocle Calzecchi Onesti at Fermo in Italy experiments with tubes containing powder and nickel silver with traces of mercury metal filings and their reactions when conducting electricity  This would lead to the development of the iron filings filled coherer  a radio detecting device usually credited to Edouard Branly in 1890   1 1 1  Hertzian waves  Between 1886 and 1888 Heinrich Rudolf Hertz published the results of his experiments where he was able to transmit electromagnetic waves  radio waves  through the air  proving Maxwell s electromagnetic theory  Early on after their discovery  radio waves were referred to as  Hertzian waves   Between 1890 and 1892 physicists such as John Perry  Frederick Thomas Trouton and William Crookes proposed electromagnetic or Hertzian waves as a navigation aid or means of communication  with Crookes writing on the possibilities of wireless telegraphy based on Hertzian waves in 1892   After learning of Hertz demonstrations of wireless transmission  inventor Nikola Tesla began developing his own system based on Hertz and Maxwell s ideas  primarily as a means of wireless lighting and power distribution  Tesla  concluding that Hertz had not demonstrated airborne electromagnetic waves  radio transmission   went on to develop a system based on what he thought was the primary conductor  the earth  In 1893 demonstrations of his ideas  in St  Louis  Missouri and at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia  Tesla proposed this wireless power technology could also incorporate a system for the telecommunication of information   In a lecture on the work of Hertz  shortly after his death  Professor Oliver Lodge and Alexander Muirhead demonstrated wireless signaling using Hertzian  radio  waves in the lecture theater of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History on August 14  1894  During the demonstration a radio signal was sent from the neighboring Clarendon laboratory building  and received by apparatus in the lecture theater   Building on the work of Lodge  the Indian Bengali physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose ignited gunpowder and rang a bell at a distance using millimeter range wavelength microwaves in a November 1894 public demonstration at the Town Hall of Kolkata   Bose wrote in a Bengali essay  Adrisya Alok  Invisible Light    The invisible light can easily pass through brick walls  buildings etc  Therefore  messages can be transmitted by means of it without the mediation of wires   Bose’s first scientific paper   On polarisation of electric rays by double refracting crystals  was communicated to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895  His second paper was communicated to the Royal Society of London by Lord Rayleigh in October 1895  In December 1895  the London journal The Electrician  Vol  36  published Bose’s paper   On a new electro polariscope   At that time  the word  coherer   coined by Lodge  was used in the English speaking world for Hertzian wave receivers or detectors  The Electrician readily commented on Bose’s coherer   December 1895   The Englishman  18 January 1896  quoted from the Electrician and commented as follows   Should Professor Bose succeed in perfecting and patenting his ‘Coherer’  we may in time see the whole system of coast lighting throughout the navigable world revolutionised by an Indian Bengali scientist working single handed in our Presidency College Laboratory   Bose planned to  perfect his coherer   but never thought of patenting it   In 1895  conducting experiments along the lines of Hertz s research  Alexander Stepanovich Popov built his first radio receiver  which contained a coherer  Further refined as a lightning detector  it was presented to the Russian Physical and Chemical Society on May 7  1895  A depiction of Popov s lightning detector was printed in the Journal of the Russian Physical and Chemical Society the same year  Until recently  mistakenly believed that it was the first description  publication of the minutes 15 201 of this session — December issue of the journal RPCS   but in fact the first description of the device was given by Dmitry Aleksandrovich Lachinov in July 1895 in the 2nd edition of his course  Fundamentals of Meteorology and climatology  — the first in Russia  Popov s receiver was created on the improved basis of Lodge s receiver  and originally intended for reproduction of its experiments   1 1 2  Marconi  In 1894 the young Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began working on the idea of building a commercial wireless telegraphy system based on the use of Hertzian waves  radio waves   a line of inquiry that he noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing  Marconi read through the literature and used the ideas of others who were experimenting with radio waves but did a great deal to develop devices such as portable transmitters and receiver systems that could work over long distances  turning what was essentially a laboratory experiment into useful communication system  By August 1895 Marconi was field testing his system but even with improvements he was only able to transmit signals up to one half mile  a distance Oliver Lodge had predicted in 1894 as the maximum transmission distance for radio waves  Marconi raised the height of his antenna and hit upon the idea of grounding his transmitter and receiver  With these improvements the system was capable of transmitting signals up to and over hills  Marconi s experimental apparatus proved to be the first engineering complete  commercially successful radio transmission system  Marconi’s apparatus is also credited for saving the 700 people that survived the tragic Titanic disaster   In 1896  Marconi was awarded British patent 12039  Improvements in transmitting electrical impulses and signals and in apparatus there for  the first patent ever issued for a Hertzian wave  radio wave  base wireless telegraphic system  In 1897  he established a radio station on the Isle of Wight  England  Marconi opened his  wireless  factory in the former silk works at Hall Street  Chelmsford  England in 1898  employing around 60 people  Shortly after the 1900s  Marconi held the patent rights for radio  Marconi would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 and be more successful than any other inventor in his ability to commercialize radio and its associated equipment into a global business  In the US some of his subsequent patented refinements  but not his original radio patent  would be overturned in a 1935 court case  upheld by the US Supreme Court in 1943    1 2  20th century  In 1900  Brazilian priest Roberto Landell de Moura transmitted the human voice wirelessly  According to the newspaper Jornal do Comercio  June 10  1900   he conducted his first public experiment on June 3  1900  in front of journalists and the General Consul of Great Britain  C P  Lupton  in São Paulo  Brazil  for a distance of approximately   The points of transmission and reception were Alto de Santana and Paulista Avenue   One year after that experiment  he received his first patent from the Brazilian government  It was described as  equipment for the purpose of phonetic transmissions through space  land and water elements at a distance with or without the use of wires   Four months later  knowing that his invention had real value  he left Brazil for the United States with the intent of patenting the machine at the US Patent Office in Washington  DC   Having few resources  he had to rely on friends to push his project  In spite of great difficulty  three patents were awarded   The Wave Transmitter   October 11  1904   which is the precursor of today s radio transceiver   The Wireless Telephone  and the  Wireless Telegraph   both dated November 22  1904   The next advancement was the vacuum tube detector  invented by Westinghouse engineers  On Christmas Eve 1906  Reginald Fessenden used a synchronous rotary spark transmitter for the first radio program broadcast  from Ocean Bluff Brant Rock  Massachusetts  Ships at sea heard a broadcast that included Fessenden playing O Holy Night on the violin and reading a passage from the Bible   In June 1912 Marconi opened the world s first purpose built radio factory at New Street Works in Chelmsford  England   This was  for all intents and purposes  the first transmission of what is now known as amplitude modulation or AM radio  The first radio news program was broadcast August 31  1920 by station 8MK in Detroit  Michigan  which survives today as all news format station WWJ under ownership of the CBS network  The first college radio station began broadcasting on October 14  1920 from Union College  Schenectady  New York under the personal call letters of Wendell King  an African American student at the school   That month 2ADD  renamed WRUC in 1947   aired what is believed to be the first public entertainment broadcast in the United States  a series of Thursday night concerts initially heard within a radius and later for a radius  In November 1920  it aired the first broadcast of a sporting event  At 9 pm on August 27  1920  Sociedad Radio Argentina aired a live performance of Richard Wagner s opera Parsifal from the Coliseo Theater in downtown Buenos Aires  Only about twenty homes in the city had receivers to tune in this radio program  Meanwhile  regular entertainment broadcasts commenced in 1922 from the Marconi Research Centre at Writtle  England   Sports broadcasting began at this time as well  including the college football on radio broadcast of a 1921 West Virginia vs  Pittsburgh football game   One of the first developments in the early 20th century was that aircraft used commercial AM radio stations for navigation  This continued until the early 1960s when VOR systems became widespread  In the early 1930s  single sideband and frequency modulation were invented by amateur radio operators  By the end of the decade  they were established commercial modes  Radio was used to transmit pictures visible as television as early as the 1920s  Commercial television transmissions started in North America and Europe in the 1940s   In 1947 AT&T commercialized the Mobile Telephone Service  From its start in St  Louis in 1946  AT&T then introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948  Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5 000 customers placing about each week  Because only three radio channels were available  only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time  Mobile Telephone Service was expensive  costing per month  plus 0 30 to 0 40 USD per local call  equivalent to about per month and 3 50 to 4 75 per call in 2012 USD  The Advanced Mobile Phone System analog mobile cell phone system  developed by Bell Labs  was introduced in the Americas in 1978  gave much more capacity  It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America  and other locales  through the 1980s and into the 2000s   In 1954  the Regency company introduced a pocket transistor radio  the TR 1  powered by a  standard 22 5 V Battery   In 1955  the newly formed Sony company introduced its first transistorized radio  It was small enough to fit in a vest pocket  powered by a small battery  It was durable  because it had no vacuum tubes to burn out  Over the next 20 years  transistors replaced tubes almost completely except for high power transmitters   By 1963  color television was being broadcast commercially  though not all broadcasts or programs were in color   and the first  radio  communication satellite  Telstar  was launched  In the late 1960s  the U S  long distance telephone network began to convert to a digital network  employing digital radios for many of its links  In the 1970s  LORAN became the premier radio navigation system   Soon  the U S  Navy experimented with satellite navigation  culminating in the launch of the Global Positioning System  GPS  constellation in 1987  In the early 1990s  amateur radio experimenters began to use personal computers with audio cards to process radio signals  In 1994  the U S  Army and DARPA launched an aggressive  successful project to construct a software defined radio that can be programmed to be virtually any radio by changing its software program  Digital transmissions began to be applied to broadcasting in the late 1990s   2  Invention  The idea of wireless communication predates the discovery of  radio  with experiments in  wireless telegraphy  via inductive and capacitive induction and transmission through the ground  water  and even train tracks from the 1830s on  In 1873 James Clerk Maxwell showed mathematically that electromagnetic waves could propagate through free space  It is likely that the first intentional transmission of a signal by means of electromagnetic waves was performed in an experiment by David Edward Hughes around 1880  although this was considered to be induction at the time  In 1888 Heinrich Rudolf Hertz was able to conclusively prove transmitted airborne electromagnetic waves in an experiment confirming Maxwell s theory of electromagnetism   After the discovery of these  Hertzian waves   it would take almost 20 years for the term  radio  to be universally adopted for this type of electromagnetic radiation  many scientists and inventors experimented with wireless transmission  some trying to develop a system of communication  some not  some intentionally using these new Hertzian waves  some not  Maxwell s theory showing that light and Hertzian electromagnetic waves were the same phenomenon at different wavelengths led  Maxwellian  scientist such as John Perry  Frederick Thomas Trouton and Alexander Trotter to assume they would be analogous to optical signaling and the Serbian American engineer Nikola Tesla to consider them relatively useless for communication since  light  could not transmit further than line of sight  In 1892 the physicist William Crookes wrote on the possibilities of wireless telegraphy based on Hertzian waves and in 1893 Tesla proposed a system for transmitting intelligence and wireless power using the earth as the medium  Others  such as Amos Dolbear  Sir Oliver Lodge  Reginald Fessenden  and Alexander Popov were involved in the development of components and theory involved with the transmission and reception of airborn electromagnetic waves for their own theoretical work or as a potential means of communication   Over several years starting in 1894 the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi built the first complete  commercially successful wireless telegraphy system based on airborne Hertzian waves  radio transmission   Marconi demonstrated application of radio in military and marine communications and started a company for the development and propagation of radio communication services and equipment   3  Start of the 20th century  Around the start of the 20th century  the Slaby Arco wireless system was developed by Adolf Slaby and Georg von Arco  In 1900  Reginald Fessenden made a weak transmission of voice over the airwaves  In 1901  Marconi conducted the first successful transatlantic experimental radio communications  In 1904  The U S  Patent Office reversed its decision  awarding Marconi a patent for the invention of radio  possibly influenced by Marconi s financial backers in the States  who included Thomas Edison and Andrew Carnegie  This also allowed the U S  government  among others  to avoid having to pay the royalties that were being claimed by Tesla for use of his patents  For more information see Marconi s radio work  In 1907  Marconi established the first commercial transatlantic radio communications service  between Clifden  Ireland and Glace Bay  Newfoundland   3 1  Julio Cervera Baviera  Julio Cervera Baviera developed radio in Spain around 1902  Cervera Baviera obtained patents in England  Germany  Belgium  and Spain  In May–June 1899  Cervera had  with the blessing of the Spanish Army  visited Marconi s radiotelegraphic installations on the English Channel  and worked to develop his own system  He began collaborating with Marconi on resolving the problem of a wireless communication system  obtaining some patents by the end of 1899  Cervera  who had worked with Marconi and his assistant George Kemp in 1899  resolved the difficulties of wireless telegraph and obtained his first patents prior to the end of that year  On March 22  1902  Cervera founded the Spanish Wireless Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and brought to his corporation the patents he had obtained in Spain  Belgium  Germany and England  He established the second and third regular radiotelegraph service in the history of the world in 1901 and 1902 by maintaining regular transmissions between Tarifa and Ceuta for three consecutive months  and between Javea  Cabo de la Nao  and Ibiza  Cabo Pelado   This is after Marconi established the radiotelegraphic service between the Isle of Wight and Bournemouth in 1898  In 1906  Domenico Mazzotto wrote   In Spain the Minister of War has applied the system perfected by the commander of military engineering  Julio Cervera Baviera  English patent No  20084  1899     Cervera thus achieved some success in this field  but his radiotelegraphic activities ceased suddenly  the reasons for which are unclear to this day   3 2  British Marconi  Using various patents  the British Marconi company was established in 1897 and began communication between coast radio stations and ships at sea  This company  along with its subsidiaries Canadian Marconi and American Marconi  had a stranglehold on ship to shore communication  It operated much the way American Telephone and Telegraph operated until 1983  owning all of its equipment and refusing to communicate with non Marconi equipped ships  In June 1912  after the RMS Titanic disaster  due to increased production Marconi opened the world s first purpose built radio factory at New Street Works in Chelmsford  and in 1932 the Marconi Research Laboratory  Many inventions improved the quality of radio  and amateurs experimented with uses of radio  thus planting the first seeds of broadcasting   3 3  Telefunken  The company Telefunken was founded on May 27  1903  as  Telefunken society for wireless telefon  of Siemens & Halske  S & H  and the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft  General Electricity Company  as joint undertakings for radio engineering in Berlin  It continued as a joint venture of AEG and Siemens AG  until Siemens left in 1941  In 1911  Kaiser Wilhelm II sent Telefunken engineers to West Sayville  New York to erect three 600 foot  180 m  radio towers there  Nikola Tesla assisted in the construction  A similar station was erected in Nauen  creating the only wireless communication between North America and Europe   3 4  Reginald Fessenden  The invention of amplitude modulated  AM  radio  so that more than one station can send signals  as opposed to spark gap radio  where one transmitter covers the entire bandwidth of the spectrum  is attributed to Reginald Fessenden and Lee de Forest  On Christmas Eve 1906  Reginald Fessenden used an Alexanderson alternator and rotary spark gap transmitter to make the first radio audio broadcast  from Brant Rock  Massachusetts  Ships at sea heard a broadcast that included Fessenden playing O Holy Night on the violin and reading a passage from the Bible   3 5  Ferdinand Braun  In 1909  Marconi and Karl Ferdinand Braun were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for  contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy    3 6  Charles David Herrold  In April 1909 Charles David Herrold  an electronics instructor in San Jose  California constructed a broadcasting station  It used spark gap technology  but modulated the carrier frequency with the human voice  and later music  The station  San Jose Calling   there were no call letters   continued to eventually become today s KCBS in San Francisco  Herrold  the son of a Santa Clara Valley farmer  coined the terms  narrowcasting  and  broadcasting   respectively to identify transmissions destined for a single receiver such as that on board a ship  and those transmissions destined for a general audience   The term  broadcasting  had been used in farming to define the tossing of seed in all directions   Charles Herrold did not claim to be the first to transmit the human voice  but he claimed to be the first to conduct  broadcasting   To help the radio signal to spread in all directions  he designed some omnidirectional antennas  which he mounted on the rooftops of various buildings in San Jose  Herrold also claims to be the first broadcaster to accept advertising  he exchanged publicity for a local record store for records to play on his station   though this dubious honour usually is foisted on WEAF  1922   In 1912  the RMS Titanic sank in the northern Atlantic Ocean  After this  wireless telegraphy using spark gap transmitters quickly became universal on large ships  In 1913  the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea was convened and produced a treaty requiring shipboard radio stations to be manned 24 hours a day  A typical high power spark gap was a rotating commutator with six to twelve contacts per wheel  nine inches  229 mm  to a foot wide  driven by about 2 000 volts DC  As the gaps made and broke contact  the radio wave was audible as a tone in a magnetic detector at a remote location  The telegraph key often directly made and broke the 2 000 volt supply  One side of the spark gap was directly connected to the antenna  Receivers with thermionic valves became commonplace before spark gap transmitters were replaced by continuous wave transmitters   3 7  Harold J  Power  On March 8  1916  Harold Power with his radio company American Radio and Research Company  AMRAD   broadcast the first continuous broadcast in the world from Tufts University under the call sign 1XE  it lasted 3 hours   The company later became the first to broadcast on a daily schedule  and the first to broadcast radio dance programs  university professor lectures  the weather  and bedtime stories   3 8  Edwin Armstrong  Inventor Edwin Howard Armstrong is credited with developing many of the features of radio as it is known today  Armstrong patented three important inventions that made today s radio possible  Regeneration  the superheterodyne circuit and wide band frequency modulation or FM  Regeneration or the use of positive feedback greatly increased the amplitude of received radio signals to the point where they could be heard without headphones  The superhet simplified radio receivers by doing away with the need for several tuning controls  It made radios more sensitive and selective as well  FM gave listeners a static free experience with better sound quality and fidelity than AM   4  Audio broadcasting  1919 to 1950s   4 1  Crystal sets  The most common type of receiver before vacuum tubes was the crystal set  although some early radios used some type of amplification through electric current or battery  Inventions of the triode amplifier  motor generator  and detector enabled audio radio  The use of amplitude modulation  AM   with which more than one station can simultaneously send signals  as opposed to spark gap radio  where one transmitter covers the entire bandwidth of spectra  was pioneered by Fessenden and Lee de Forest   To this day there is a small but avid base of fans of this technology who study and practice the art and science of designing and making crystal sets as a hobby  the Boy Scouts of America have often undertaken such craft projects to introduce boys to electronics and radio  and quite a number of them having grown up remain staunch fans of a radio that  runs on nothing  forever   As the only energy available is that gathered by the antenna system  there are inherent limitations on how much sound even an ideal set could produce  but with only moderately decent antenna systems remarkable performance is possible with a superior set   4 2  The first vacuum tubes  During the mid 1920s  amplifying vacuum tubes  or thermionic valves in the UK  revolutionized radio receivers and transmitters  John Ambrose Fleming developed an earlier tube known as an  oscillation valve   it was a diode   Lee de Forest placed a screen  the  grid  electrode  between the filament and plate electrode  creating the triode  The Dutch engineer Hanso Schotanus à Steringa Idzerda made the first regular wireless broadcast for entertainment from his home in The Hague on 6 November 1919  He broadcast his popular program four nights per week until 1924 when he ran into financial troubles   On 27 August 1920  regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in Argentina  pioneered by the group around Enrique Telémaco Susini  and spark gap telegraphy stopped  On 31 August 1920 the first known radio news program was broadcast by station 8MK  the unlicensed predecessor of WWJ  AM  in Detroit  Michigan  In 1922 regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the UK from the Marconi Research Centre 2MT at Writtle near Chelmsford  England  Early radios ran the entire power of the transmitter through a carbon microphone  In the 1920s  the Westinghouse company bought Lee de Forest s and Edwin Armstrong s patent  During the mid 1920s  Amplifying vacuum tubes  US  thermionic valves  UK  revolutionized radio receivers and transmitters  Westinghouse engineers developed a more modern vacuum tube   4 3  Political interest in the United Kingdom  The British government and the state owned postal services found themselves under massive pressure from the wireless industry  including telegraphy  and early radio adopters to open up to the new medium  In an internal confidential report from February 25  1924  the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee stated   4 4  Licensed commercial public radio stations  The question of the  first  publicly targeted licensed radio station in the U S  has more than one answer and depends on semantics  Settlement of this  first  question may hang largely upon what constitutes  regular  programming   It is commonly attributed to KDKA in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  which in October 1920 received its license and went on the air as the first US licensed commercial broadcasting station on November 2  1920 with the presidential election results as its inaugural show  but was not broadcasting daily until 1921   Their engineer Frank Conrad had been broadcasting from on the two call sign signals of 8XK and 8YK since 1916   Technically  KDKA was the first of several already extant stations to receive a  limited commercial  license   On February 17  1919  station 9XM at the University of Wisconsin in Madison broadcast human speech to the public at large  9XM was first experimentally licensed in 1914  began regular Morse code transmissions in 1916  and its first music broadcast in 1917  Regularly scheduled broadcasts of voice and music began in January 1921  That station is still on the air today as WHA   On August 20  1920 8MK  began broadcasing daily and was credited by famed inventor Lee De Forest as the first commercial station  8MK was licensed to a teenager  Michael DeLisle Lyons  and financed by E  W  Scripps  In 1921 8MK changed to WBL and then to WWJ in 1922  in Detroit  It has carried a regular schedule of programming to the present and also broadcast the 1920 presidential election returns just as KDKA did  Inventor Lee DeForest claims to have been present during 8MK s earliest broadcasts  since the station was using a transmitter sold by his company  In August 1921  teenagers Michael DeLisle Lyons  his younger brother Francis  Frank  Edward Lyons and Ed Clark  founder of WJR   Detroit  put the first radio in a police car in Toledo  Ohio  There is the history noted above of Charles David Herrold s radio services as early as 1909 with call signs FN  SJN  6XF  and 6XE until 1921 when it became WKQW and then finally KCBS in 1949   The first station to receive a commercial license was WBZ  then in Springfield  Massachusetts   Lists provided to the Boston Globe by the U S  Department of Commerce showed that WBZ received its commercial license on 15 September 1921  another Westinghouse station  WJZ  then in Newark  New Jersey  received its commercial license on November 7  the same day as KDKA did  What separates WJZ and WBZ from KDKA is the fact that neither of the former stations remain in their original city of license  whereas KDKA has remained in Pittsburgh for its entire existence   2XG  Launched by Lee De Forest in the Highbridge section of New York City  that station began daily broadcasts in 1916  Like most experimental radio stations  however  it had to go off the air when the U S  entered World War I in 1917  and did not return to the air   1XE  Launched by Harold J  Power in Medford  Massachusetts  1XE was an experimental station that started broadcasting in 1917  It had to go off the air during World War I  but started up again after the war  and began regular voice and music broadcasts in 1919  However  the station did not receive its commercial license  becoming WGI  until 1922   2XN  broadcasting from the City College of New York  2ZK  broadcasting in New Rochelle  New York  WWV  the U S  Government time service  which had believed to have started 6 months before KDKA in Washington  D C  but in 1966 was transferred to Ft  Collins  Colorado   WRUC  located on Union College in Schenectady  New York  was launched as W2XQ  WHA  AM   located at the University of Wisconsin–Madison  Madison  Wisconsin  was launched as 9XM   KQV  one of Pittsburgh s five original AM stations  signed on as amateur station  8ZAE  on November 19  1919  but did not receive a commercial license until January 9  1922  Outside the United States there are also claims for the first radio stations   XWA  Marconi s broadcast station in Montreal  Canada  since 1919  was CFCF  later CINW and shut down in February 2010   On August 27  1920 the Argentina Station started the first transmission from Coliseo Theatre at Buenos Aires  Argentina  Later that station received the name LOR Radio Argentina  and finally LR2 Radio Argentina  That station was in service until 31 December 1997 at 1110 kHz  Broadcasting was not yet supported by advertising or listener sponsorship  The stations owned by manufacturers and department stores were established to sell radios and those owned by newspapers to sell newspapers and express the opinions of the owners  In the 1920s  radio was first used to transmit pictures visible as television  During the early 1930s  single sideband  SSB  and frequency modulation  FM  were invented by amateur radio operators  By 1940  they were established commercial modes   Westinghouse was brought into the patent allies group  General Electric  American Telephone and Telegraph  and Radio Corporation of America  and became a part owner of RCA  All radios made by GE and Westinghouse were sold under the RCA label 60% GE and 40% Westinghouse  ATT s Western Electric would build radio transmitters  The patent allies attempted to set up a monopoly  but they failed due to successful competition  Much to the dismay of the patent allies  several of the contracts for inventor s patents held clauses protecting  amateurs  and allowing them to use the patents  Whether the competing manufacturers were really amateurs was ignored by these competitors   These features arose   Commercial  United States  or governmental  Europe  station networks  Federal Radio Commission  Federal Communications Commission  CCIR  Birth of the soap opera  Race towards shorter waves and FM  4 5  FM and television start  In 1933  FM radio was patented by inventor Edwin H  Armstrong  FM uses frequency modulation of the radio wave to reduce static and interference from electrical equipment and the atmosphere  In 1937  W1XOJ  the first experimental FM radio station  was granted a construction permit by the US Federal Communications Commission  FCC   In the 1930s  regular analog television broadcasting began in some parts of Europe and North America  By the end of the decade there were roughly 25 000 all electronic television receivers in existence worldwide  the majority of them in the UK  In the US  Armstrong s FM system was designated by the FCC to transmit and receive television sound   4 6  FM in Europe  After World War II  the FM radio broadcast was introduced in Germany  In 1948  a new wavelength plan was set up for Europe at a meeting in Copenhagen  Because of the recent war  Germany  which did not exist as a state and so was not invited  was only given a small number of medium wave frequencies  which are not very good for broadcasting  For this reason Germany began broadcasting on UKW   Ultrakurzwelle   i e  ultra short wave  nowadays called VHF  which was not covered by the Copenhagen plan  After some amplitude modulation experience with VHF  it was realized that FM radio was a much better alternative for VHF radio than AM  Because of this history FM Radio is still referred to as  UKW Radio  in Germany  Other European nations followed a bit later  when the superior sound quality of FM and the ability to run many more local stations because of the more limited range of VHF broadcasts were realized   5  Later 20th century developments  In 1954 Regency introduced a pocket transistor radio  the TR 1  powered by a  standard 22 5V Battery   In the early 1960s  VOR systems finally became widespread for aircraft navigation  before that  aircraft used commercial AM radio stations for navigation   AM stations are still marked on U S  aviation charts   In 1960 Sony introduced their first transistorized radio  small enough to fit in a vest pocket  and able to be powered by a small battery  It was durable  because there were no tubes to burn out  Over the next twenty years  transistors displaced tubes almost completely except for picture tubes and very high power or very high frequency uses   5 1  Color television and digital  1953  NTSC compatible color television introduced in the US   1962  Telstar 1  the first communications satellite  relayed the first publicly available live transatlantic television signal   Late 1960s  The US long distance telephone network began to convert to a digital network  employing digital radios for many of its links   1970s  LORAN became the premier radio navigation system  Soon  the US Navy experimented with satellite navigation   1987  The GPS constellation of satellites was launched   Early 1990s  Amateur radio experimenters began to use personal computers with audio cards to process radio signals   1994  The US Army and DARPA launched an aggressive successful project to construct a software radio that could become a different radio on the fly by changing software   Late 1990s  Digital transmissions began to be applied to broadcasting   5 2  Telex on radio  Telegraphy did not go away on radio  Instead  the degree of automation increased  On land lines in the 1930s  teletypewriters automated encoding  and were adapted to pulse code dialing to automate routing  a service called telex  For thirty years  telex was the absolute cheapest form of long distance communication  because up to 25 telex channels could occupy the same bandwidth as one voice channel  For business and government  it was an advantage that telex directly produced written documents   Telex systems were adapted to short wave radio by sending tones over single sideband  CCITT R 44  the most advanced pure telex standard  incorporated character level error detection and retransmission as well as automated encoding and routing  For many years  telex on radio  TOR  was the only reliable way to reach some third world countries  TOR remains reliable  though less expensive forms of e mail are displacing it  Many national telecom companies historically ran nearly pure telex networks for their governments  and they ran many of these links over short wave radio   5 3  Mobile phones  In 1947 AT&T commercialized the Mobile Telephone Service  From its start in St  Louis in 1946  AT&T then introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948  Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5 000 customers placing about each week  Because only three radio channels were available  only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time  Mobile Telephone Service was expensive  costing per month  plus 0 30 to 0 40 USD per local call  equivalent to about per month and 3 50 to 4 75 per call in 2012 USD  The Advanced Mobile Phone System analog mobile cell phone system  developed by Bell Labs  was introduced in the Americas in 1978  gave much more capacity  It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America  and other locales  through the 1980s and into the 2000s   6  Legal issues with radio  When radio was introduced in the 1920s many predicted the end of records  Radio was a free medium for the public to hear music for which they would normally pay  While some companies saw radio as a new avenue for promotion  others feared it would cut into profits from record sales and live performances  Many companies had their major stars sign agreements that they would not appear on radio   Indeed  the music recording industry had a severe drop in profits after the introduction of the radio  For a while  it appeared as though radio was a definite threat to the record industry  Radio ownership grew from two out of five homes in 1931 to four out of five homes in 1938  Meanwhile record sales fell from $75 million in 1929 to $26 million in 1938  with a low point of $5 million in 1933   though the economics of the situation were also affected by the Great Depression   The copyright owners of these songs were concerned that they would see no gain from the popularity of radio and the ‘free’ music it provided  Luckily  everything they needed to make this new medium work for them already existed in previous copyright law  The copyright holder for a song had control over all public performances ‘for profit ’ The problem now was proving that the radio industry  which was just figuring out for itself how to make money from advertising and currently offered free music to anyone with a receiver  was making a profit from the songs   The test case was against Bamberger Department Store in Newark  New Jersey in 1922  The store was broadcasting music throughout its store on the radio station WOR  No advertisements were heard  except for at the beginning of the broadcast which announced  L  Bamberger and Co   One of America s Great Stores  Newark  New Jersey   It was determined through this and previous cases  such as the lawsuit against Shanley s Restaurant  that Bamberger was using the songs for commercial gain  thus making it a public performance for profit  which meant the copyright owners were due payment   With this ruling the American Society of Composers  Authors and Publishers  ASCAP  began collecting licensing fees from radio stations in 1923  The beginning sum was $250 for all music protected under ASCAP  but for larger stations the price soon ballooned up to $5 000  Edward Samuels reports in his book The Illustrated Story of Copyright that  radio and TV licensing represents the single greatest source of revenue for ASCAP and its composers  …  and  a n average member of ASCAP gets about $150–$200 per work per year  or about $5 000 $6 000 for all of a member s compositions   Not long after the Bamberger ruling  ASCAP had to once again defend their right to charge fees  in 1924  The Dill Radio Bill would have allowed radio stations to play music without paying and licensing fees to ASCAP or any other music licensing corporations  The bill did not pass   7  Exotic technologies  Meteor scatter  Earth Moon Earth communication  8  See also  Histories  History of electrical engineering  History of electromagnetism  History of electromagnetic
