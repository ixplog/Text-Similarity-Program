Maria Feodorovna  26 November 1847 – 13 October 1928   christened Dagmar  was a Danish princess who became Empress of Russia as spouse of Emperor Alexander III of Russia  She was the second daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse Cassel and sister of Britain s Queen Alexandra  and King George I of Greece  Among her children was the last Russian monarch  Emperor Nicholas II of Russia  whom she outlived by ten years   1  Early life  Princess Marie Sophie Frederikke Dagmar was born at the Yellow Palace in Copenhagen  Her father was Prince Christian of Schleswig Holstein Sonderburg Glücksburg  a member of a relatively impoverished princely cadet line  Her mother was Princess Louise of Hesse Kassel   She was baptized into the Lutheran faith and named after her kinswoman Marie Sophie Fredrica of Hesse Kassel  Queen Dowager of Denmark as well as the medieval Danish queen  Dagmar of Bohemia  Growing up  she was known by the name Dagmar  Most of her life  she was known as Maria Feodorovna     the name which she took when she converted to Orthodoxy immediately before her 1866 marriage to the future Emperor Alexander III  She was known within her family as Minnie   In 1852  Dagmar s father became heir presumptive to the throne of Denmark  largely due to the succession rights of his wife Louise as niece of King Christian VIII  In 1853  he was given the title Prince of Denmark and he and his family were given an official summer residence  Bernstorff Palace  Dagmar s father became King of Denmark in 1863 upon the death of King Frederick VII   Due to the brilliant marital alliances of his children  he became known as the  Father in law of Europe   Dagmar s eldest brother would succeed his father as King Frederick VIII of Denmark  one of whose sons would be elected as King of Norway   Her elder  and favorite  sister  Alexandra married Albert Edward  the Prince of Wales  the future King Edward VII  in March 1863  Alexandra  along with being queen consort of King Edward VII  was also mother of George V of the United Kingdom  which helps to explain the striking resemblance between their sons Nicholas II and George V  Within months of Alexandra s marriage  Dagmar s second older brother  Wilhelm  was elected as King George I of the Hellenes  Her younger sister was Thyra  Duchess of Cumberland  She also had another younger brother  Valdemar   During her upbringing  Dagmar  together with her sister Alexandra  was given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of swimming for women  Nancy Edberg  she would later welcome Edberg to Russia  where she came on royal scholarship to hold swimming lessons for women   2  Twice a fiancée  ultimately a bride  The rise of Slavophile ideology in the Russian Empire led Alexander II of Russia to search for a bride for the heir apparent  Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich of Russia  in countries other than the German states that had traditionally provided consorts for the tsars  In 1864  Nicholas  or  Nixa  as he was known in his family  went to Denmark where he was betrothed to Dagmar  On 22 April 1865 he died from meningitis  His last wish was that Dagmar would marry his younger brother  the future Alexander III  Dagmar was distraught after her young fiancé s death  She was so heartbroken when she returned to her homeland that her relatives were seriously worried about her health  She had already become emotionally attached to Russia and often thought of the huge  remote country that was to have been her home  The disaster had brought her very close to  Nixa s  parents  and she received a letter from Alexander II in which the Emperor attempted to console her  He told Dagmar in very affectionate terms that he hoped she would still consider herself a member of their family  In June 1866  while on a visit to Copenhagen  the Tsarevich Alexander asked Dagmar for her hand  They had been in her room looking over photographs together   Dagmar left Copenhagen on 1 September 1866  Hans Christian Andersen  who had occasionally been invited to tell stories to Dagmar and her siblings when they were children  was among the crowd which flocked to the quay in order to see her off  The writer remarked in his diary   Yesterday  at the quay  while passing me by  she stopped and took me by the hand  My eyes were full of tears  What a poor child  Oh Lord  be kind and merciful to her  They say that there is a brilliant court in Saint Petersburg and the tsar s family is nice  still  she heads for an unfamiliar country  where people are different and religion is different and where she will have none of her former acquaintances by her side    Dagmar was warmly welcomed in Kronstadt by Alexander II of Russia and all his family  She converted to Orthodoxy and became Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia  The lavish wedding took place on in the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace in St  Petersburg  Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the wedding  and in their stead  they sent her brother  Crown Prince Frederick  Her brother in law  the Prince of Wales  had also travelled to St  Petersburg for the ceremony  pregnancy had prevented the Princess of Wales from attending  After the wedding night  Alexander wrote in his diary   I took off my slippers and my silver embroidered robe and felt the body of my beloved next to mine    How I felt then  I do not wish to describe here  Afterwards we talked for a long time   After the many wedding parties were over the newlyweds moved into the Anichkov Palace in St Petersburg where they were to live for the next 15 years  when they were not taking extended holidays at their summer villa Livadia in the Crimean Peninsula   3  Tsarevna  Maria Feodorovna was pretty and popular  Early on she made it a priority to learn the Russian language and to try to understand the Russian people  She rarely interfered with politics  preferring to devote her time and energies to her family  charities and the more social side of her position  Her one exception was her militant anti German sentiment due to the annexation of Danish territories by Prussia in 1864  a sentiment echoed by her sister  Alexandra   On May 6  1868  Maria Feodorovna became a mother for the first time  with the birth of her eldest son  Nicholas  Her next son  Alexander Alexandrovich  born in 1869 died from meningitis in infancy  She would bear Alexander four more children who reached adulthood  George  b  1871   Xenia  b  1875   Michael  b  1878  and Olga  b  1882   As a mother  she doted on and was quite possessive of her sons  However  she had a more distant relationship with her daughters   In 1873  Maria  Alexander and their two eldest sons made a journey to England  The imperial couple and their children were entertained at Marlborough House by the Prince and Princess of Wales  and delighted London society by dressing alike at social gatherings  The following year  Maria and Alexander welcomed the Prince and Princess of Wales to St  Petersburg  who had come for the wedding of the Prince s younger brother  Alfred  to Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna  daughter of Tsar Alexander II and the sister of the tsarevich   4  Empress of All the Russias  On the morning of 13 March 1881  Alexander II  aged sixty two  was killed by a bomb on the way back to the Winter Palace from a military parade  In her diary  Maria later described how the wounded  still living Emperor was taken to the palace   His legs were crushed terribly and ripped open to the knee  a bleeding mass  with half a boot on the right foot  and only the sole of the foot remaining on the left   Alexander II died a few hours later  Although the people were not enamoured of the new Emperor  they adored Russia s new empress  As Maria s contemporaries said of her   She is truly an Empress   She herself was not altogether pleased with her new status  In her diary she wrote   Our happiest and serenest times are now over  My peace and calm are gone  for now I will only ever be able to worry about Sasha   Despite being haunted by her father in law s gruesome death and her anxiety over the safety of her husband  at Alexander II s funeral  she was at least afforded the comfort of the presence of her brother in law and favorite sister  the Prince and Princess of Wales  the latter of whom  despite her husband s reluctance and Queen Victoria s objections  stayed on in Russia with Maria for several weeks after the funeral   Alexander and Maria were crowned at the Kremlin in Moscow on 27 May 1883  Just before the coronation  a major conspiracy had been uncovered  which cast a pall over the celebration  Nevertheless over 8000 guests attended the splendid ceremony  Because of the many threats against Maria and Alexander III  the head of the security police  General Cherevin  shortly after the coronation urged the Tsar and his family to relocate to Gatchina Palace  a more secure location 50 kilometres outside St  Petersburg  The huge palace had 900 rooms and was built by Catherine the Great  The Romanovs heeded the advice  Maria and Alexander III lived at Gatchina for 13 years  and it was here that their five surviving children grew up   Under heavy guard  Alexander III and Maria made periodic trips from Gatchina to the capital to take part in official events  Maria longed for the balls and gatherings in the Winter Palace  These also occurred at Gatchina  Alexander used to enjoy joining in with the musicians  although he would end up sending them off one by one  When that happened  Maria knew the party was over   As tsarevna  and then as tsarina  Maria Feodorovna had something of a social rivalry with the popular Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna  wife of her Russian brother in law  Grand Duke Vladimir  This rivalry had echoed the one shared by their husbands  and served to exacerbate the rift within the family  While Maria Feodorovna knew better than to publicly criticize both the Grand Duke and Duchess in public  Marie Pavlovna had earned the caustic epithet of  Empress Vladimir  from the tsarina  Nearly each summer  Maria  Alexander and their children would make an annual trip to Denmark  where her parents  King Christian IX and Queen Louise  hosted family reunions  Maria s brother  King George I  and his wife  Queen Olga  would come up from Athens with their children  and the Princess of Wales  often without her husband  would come with some of her children from England  In contrast to the tight security observed in Russia  the tsar  tsarina and their children relished in the relative freedom that they could enjoy at Bernstorff and Fredensborg   During Alexander III s reign  the monarchy s opponents quickly disappeared underground  A group of students had been planning to assassinate Alexander III on the sixth anniversary of his father s death at the Peter and Paul Cathedral in St  Petersburg  The plotters had stuffed hollowed out books with dynamite  which they intended to throw at the Tsar when he arrived at the cathedral  However  the Russian secret police uncovered the plot before it could be carried out  Five students were hanged  amongst them was Aleksandr Ulyanov  older brother of Vladimir Lenin   The biggest threat to the lives of the tsar and his family  however  came not from terrorists  but from a derailment of the imperial train in the fall of 1888  Maria and her family had been at lunch in the dining car when the train jumped the tracks and slid down an embankment  causing the roof of the dining car to nearly cave in on them   When Maria s eldest sister Alexandra visited Gatchina in July 1894  she was surprised to see how weak her brother in law Alexander III had become  At the time Maria had long known that he was ill and did not have long left  She now turned her attention to her eldest son  the future Nicholas II  for it was on him that both her personal future and the future of the dynasty now depended   Nicholas had long had his heart set on marrying Princess Alix of Hesse Darmstadt  a favorite grandchild of Queen Victoria  Despite the fact that she was their godchild  neither Alexander III nor Maria approved of the match  Nicholas summed up the situation as follows   I wish to move in one direction  and it is clear that Mama wishes me to move in another   my dream is to one day marry Alix   Maria and Alexander found Alix shy and somewhat peculiar  They were also concerned that the young Princess was not possessed of the right character to be Empress of Russia  Nicholas s parents had known Alix as a child and formed the impression that she was hysterical and unbalanced  It was only when Alexander III s health was beginning to fail that they reluctantly gave permission for Nicholas to propose   5  Dowager Empress  On 1 November 1894  Alexander III died aged just forty nine at Livadia  In her diary Maria wrote   I am utterly heartbroken and despondent  but when I saw the blissful smile and the peace in his face that came after  it gave me strength   Two days later  the Prince and Princess of Wales arrived at Livadia from London  While the Prince of Wales took it upon himself to involve himself in the preparations for the funeral  the Princess of Wales spent her time comforting grieving Maria  including praying with her and sleeping at her bedside  Maria Feodorovna s birthday was a week after the funeral  and as it was a day in which court mourning could be somewhat relaxed  Nicholas used the day to marry Alix of Hesse Darmstadt  who took the name Alexandra Feodorovna  Upon Nicholas and Alexandra s marriage  Maria officially became dowager empress   Once the death of Alexander III had receded  Maria again took a brighter view of the future   Everything will be all right   as she said  Maria continued to live in the Anichkov Palace in St  Petersburg and at Gatchina Palace  In May 1896  she travelled to Moscow for the coronation of Nicholas and Alexandra   As a new Imperial Train was constructed for Nicholas II in time for his coronation  Alexander III s  Temporary Imperial Train   composed of the cars that had survived the Borki disaster and a few converted standard passenger cars  was transferred to the Empress Dowager s personal use   Maria Feodorovna s grandson in law  Prince Felix Yusupov  noted that she had great influence in the Romanov family  Sergei Witte praised her tact and diplomatic skill  Nevertheless  despite her social tact  she did not get along well with her daughter in law  Tsarina Alexandra  holding her responsible for many of the woes that beset her son Nicholas and the Russian Empire in general  The fact that Russian court custom dictated that a dowager empress took precedence over an empress consort  combined with the possessiveness that Maria had of her sons  and her jealousy of Empress Alexandra only served to exacerbate tensions between mother in law and daughter in law   By the turn of the twentieth century  Maria was spending increasing time abroad  In 1906  following the death of their father  King Christian IX  she and her sister  Alexandra  who had become queen consort of the United Kingdom in 1901  purchased the villa of Hvidøre  The following year  a change in political circumstances allowed Maria Feodorovna to be welcomed to England by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra  Maria s first visit to England since 1873  Following a visit in early 1908  Maria Feodorovna was present at her brother in law and sister s visit to Russia that summer  A little under two years later  Maria Feodorovna travelled to England yet again  this time for the funeral of her brother in law  King Edward VII  in May 1910  During her nearly three month visit to England in 1910  Maria Feodorovna attempted  unsuccessfully  to get her sister  now Dowager Queen Alexandra  to claim a position of precedence over her daughter in law  Queen Mary   Empress Maria Feodorovna  the mistress of Langinkoski retreat  was also otherwise a known friend of Finland  During the first russification period  she tried to have her son halt the constraining of the grand principality s autonomy and to recall the unpopular Governor General Bobrikov from Finland to some other position in Russia itself  During the second russification period  at the start of the First World War  the Dowager Empress  travelling by her special train through Finland to Saint Petersburg  expressed her continued disapprobation for the russification of Finland by having an orchestra of a welcoming committee to play the March of the Pori Regiment and the Finnish national anthem  Maamme   which at the time were under the explicit ban from Franz Albert Seyn  the Governor General of Finland  In 1899  Maria s second son  George  died of tuberculosis in the Caucasus  During the funeral  she kept her composure  but at the end of the service  she ran from the church clutching her son s top hat that been atop the coffin and collapsed in her carriage sobbing  Two years later  according to her daughter  Grand Duchess Olga  she arranged Olga s disastrous marriage to Peter  Duke of Oldenburg  For years Nicholas refused to grant his unhappy sister a divorce  only relenting in 1916 in the midst of the War  When Olga attempted to contract a morganatic marriage with Nikolai Kulikovsky  Maria Feodorovna and the tsar tried to dissuade her  yet  they did not protest too vehemently  Indeed  Maria Feodorovna was one of the few people who attended the wedding in November 1916  In 1912  Maria faced trouble with her youngest son  when he secretly married his mistress  much to the outrage and scandal of both Maria Feodorovna and Nicholas   5 1  War Years  In May 1914  Maria Feodorovna travelled to England to visit her sister  While she was in London  World War I broke out  forcing her to hurry home to Russia  In Berlin her train was prevented by the German authorities from continuing toward the Russian border  Instead she was obliged to return to Russia by way of  neutral  Denmark and Finland  Upon her return in August  she took up residence at Yelagin Palace  which was closer to St  Petersburg  renamed Petrograd in 1916  than Gatchina  During the War  she served as president of Russia s Red Cross  As she had done a decade earlier in the Russo Japanese War  she also financed a sanitary train  In 1916  the Dowager Empress left Petrograd to live in the Mariyinsky Palace in Kiev  reportedly in protest over the influence of Grigori Rasputin at court  She never again returned to Russia s capital   6  Revolution and exile  Revolution came to Russia in 1917  first with the February Revolution  then with Nicholas II s abdication on March 15  After travelling from Kiev to meet with her deposed son  Nicholas II in Mogilev  Maria returned to the city  where she quickly realized how Kiev had changed and that her presence was no longer wanted  She was persuaded by her family there to travel to the Crimea by train with a group of other refugee Romanovs   After a time living in one of the imperial residences in the Crimea  she received reports that her sons  her daughter in law and her grandchildren had been murdered  However  she publicly rejected the report as a rumour  On the day after the murder of the Tsar s family  Maria received a messenger from Nicky   a touching man  who told how difficult was the life of her son s family in Ekaterinburg   And nobody can help or liberate them   only God  My Lord save my poor  unlucky Nicky  help him in his hard ordeals   In her diary she comforted herself   I am sure they all got out of Russia and now the Bolsheviks are trying to hide the truth   She firmly held on to this conviction until her death  The truth was too painful for her to admit publicly  Her letters to her son and his family have since almost all been lost  but in one that survives  she wrote to Nicholas   You know that my thoughts and prayers never leave you  I think of you day and night and sometimes feel so sick at heart that I believe I cannot bear it any longer  But God is merciful  He will give us strength for this terrible ordeal   Maria s daughter Olga Alexandrovna commented further on the matter   Yet I am sure that deep in her heart my mother had steeled herself to accept the truth some years before her death    Despite the overthrow of the monarchy in 1917  the former Dowager Empress Maria at first refused to leave Russia  Only in 1919  at the urging of her sister  Dowager Queen Alexandra  did she begrudgingly depart  fleeing Crimea over the Black Sea to London  King George V sent the warship HMS Marlborough to retrieve his aunt  After a brief stay in the British base in Malta  she travelled to England  to stay with her sister  Alexandra  Although Queen Alexandra never treated her sister badly and they spent time together at Marlborough House in London and at Sandringham House in Norfolk  Maria  as a deposed dowager empress  felt that she was now  number two   in contrast to her sister  a popular dowager queen  and she eventually returned to her native Denmark  After living briefly with her nephew  King Christian X  in a wing of the Amalienborg Palace  she chose her holiday villa Hvidøre near Copenhagen as her new permanent home   There were many Russian émigrées in Copenhagen who continued to regard her as the Empress and often asked her for help  The All Russian Monarchical Assembly held in 1921 offered her the locum tenens of the Russian throne but she declined with the evasive answer  Nobody saw Nicky killed  and therefore there is a chance  She rendered financial support to Nikolai Sokolov who studied the circumstances of the death of the Tsar s family but they never met  The Grand Duchess Olga sent a telegram to Paris cancelling an appointment because it would have been too difficult for the old and sick woman to hear the terrible story of her son and his family   7  Death and burial  In November 1925  Maria s favourite sister  Queen Alexandra  died  That was the last loss that she could bear   She was ready to meet her Creator   wrote her son in law  Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich  about Maria s last years  On 13 October 1928 at Hvidøre near Copenhagen  in a house she had once shared with her sister Queen Alexandra  Maria died at the age of 80  having outlived four of her six children  Following services in Copenhagen s Russian Orthodox Alexander Nevsky Church  the Empress was interred at Roskilde Cathedral   In 2005  Queen Margarethe II of Denmark and President Vladimir Putin of Russia and their respective governments agreed that the Empress s remains should be returned to St  Petersburg in accordance with her wish to be interred next to her husband  took place from 23 to 28 September 2006  The funeral service  attended by high dignitaries  including the Crown Prince and Princess of Denmark and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent  did not pass without some turbulence  The crowd around the coffin was so great that a young Danish diplomat fell into the grave before the coffin was interred  On 26 September 2006  a statue of Maria Feodorovna was unveiled near her favourite Cottage Palace in Peterhof  Following a service at Saint Isaac s Cathedral  she was interred next to her husband Alexander III in the Peter and Paul Cathedral on 28 September 2006  140 years after her first arrival in Russia and almost 78 years after her death   8  Film and stage representations of the Dowager Empress  She was portrayed
