Plutocracy    or plutarchy  defines a society or a system ruled and dominated by the small minority of the wealthiest citizens  The first known use of the term was in 1652  Unlike systems such as democracy  capitalism  socialism or anarchism  plutocracy is not rooted in an established political philosophy  The concept of plutocracy may be advocated by the wealthy classes of a society in an indirect or surreptitious fashion  though the term itself is almost always used in a pejorative sense   1  Usage  The term plutocracy is generally used as a pejorative to describe or warn against an undesirable condition  Throughout history  political thinkers such as Winston Churchill  19th century French sociologist and historian Alexis de Tocqueville  19th century Spanish monarchist Juan Donoso Cortés and today Noam Chomsky have condemned plutocrats for ignoring their social responsibilities  using their power to serve their own purposes and thereby increasing poverty and nurturing class conflict  corrupting societies with greed and hedonism   1 1  Examples  Examples of plutocracies include the Roman Empire  some city states in Ancient Greece  the civilization of Carthage  the Italian city states merchant republics of Venice  Florence  Genoa  and pre World War II Empire of Japan  the zaibatsu    One modern  formal example of what some critics have described as a plutocracy is the City of London  The City  not the whole of modern London but the area of the ancient city  about 1 sq mile or 2 5 km2  which now mainly comprises the financial district  has a unique electoral system for its local administration  More than two thirds of voters are not residents  but rather representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City  with votes distributed according to their numbers of employees  The principal justification for this arrangement is that most of the services provided by the Corporation are used by the businesses in the City  In fact about 450 000 non residents constitute the city s day time population  far outnumbering the City s 7 000 residents   1 2  Modern politics  Historically  wealthy individuals and organizations have exerted influence over the political arena  In the modern era  many democratic republics permit fundraising for politicians who frequently rely on such income for advertising their candidacy to the voting public   Whether through individuals  corporations or advocacy groups  such donations are often believed to engender a cronyist or patronage system by which major contributors are rewarded on a quid pro quo basis  While campaign donations need not directly affect the legislative decisions of elected representatives  the natural expectation of donors is that their needs will be served by the person to whom they donated  If not  it is in their self interest to fund a different candidate or political organization   While quid pro quo agreements are generally illegal in most democracies  they are difficult to prove  short of a well documented paper trail  A core basis of democracy  being a politician s ability to freely advocate policies which benefit his or her constituents  also makes it difficult to prove that doing so might be a crime  Even the granting of appointed positions to a well documented contributor may not transgress the law  particularly if the appointee appears to be suitably qualified for the post  Some systems even specifically provide for such patronage   1 3  United States  Some modern historians  politicians and economists state that the United States was effectively plutocratic for at least part of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era periods between the end of the Civil War until the beginning of the Great Depression  President Theodore Roosevelt became known as the  trust buster  for his aggressive use of United States antitrust law  through which he managed to break up such major combinations as the largest railroad and Standard Oil  the largest oil company  According to historian David Burton   When it came to domestic political concerns  TR’s Bete Noire was the plutocracy  In his autobiographical account of taking on monopolistic corporations as president  TR recounted  ’’ …we had come to the stage where for our people what was needed was a real democracy  and of all forms of tyranny the least attractive and the most vulgar is the tyranny of mere wealth  the tyranny of a plutocracy ’’ The Sherman Antitrust Act had been enacted in 1890  with large industries reaching monopolistic or near monopolistic levels of market concentration and financial capital increasingly integrating corporations  a handful of very wealthy heads of large corporations began to exert increasing influence over industry  public opinion and politics after the Civil War  Money  according to contemporary progressive and journalist Walter Weyl  was  the mortar of this edifice   with ideological differences among politicians fading and the political realm becoming  a mere branch in a still larger  integrated business  The state  which through the party formally sold favors to the large corporations  became one of their departments    In his book The Conscience of a Liberal  in a section entitled The Politics of Plutocracy  economist Paul Krugman says plutocracy took hold because of three factors  at that time  the poorest quarter of American residents  African Americans and non naturalized immigrants  were ineligible to vote  the wealthy funded the campaigns of politicians they preferred  and vote buying was  feasible  easy and widespread   as were other forms of electoral fraud such as ballot box stuffing and intimidation of the other party s voters   The U S  instituted progressive taxation in 1913  but according to Shamus Khan  in the 1970s  elites used their increasing political power to lower their taxes  and today successfully employ what political scientist Jeffrey Winters calls  the income defense industry  to greatly reduce their taxes   1 3 1  Post World War II  In modern times  the term is sometimes used pejoratively to refer to societies rooted in state corporate capitalism or which prioritize the accumulation of wealth over other interests  According to Kevin Phillips  author and political strategist to U S  President Richard Nixon  the United States is a plutocracy in which there is a  fusion of money and government    Chrystia Freeland  author of Plutocrats  The Rise of the New Global Super Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else  says that the present trend towards plutocracy occurs because the rich feel that their interests are shared by society   When the Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote the 2011 Vanity Fair magazine article entitled  Of the 1%  by the 1%  for the 1%   the title as well as the content pointed to evidence that the United States is increasingly ruled by the wealthiest 1%  Some researchers have said the US may be drifting towards a form of oligarchy  as individual citizens have less impact than economic elites and organized interest groups upon public policy  A study conducted by political scientists Martin Gilens  Princeton University  and Benjamin Page  Northwestern University   which was released in April 2014  stated that their  analyses suggest that majorities of the American public actually have little influence over the policies our government adopts   that Gilens and Page do not characterize the US as an  oligarchy  or  plutocracy  per se  however  they do apply the concept of  civil oligarchy  as used by Jeffrey A  Winters with respect to the US   1 4  Russia  A report by Credit Suisse in 2013 states that  Russia has the highest level of wealth inequality in the world  apart from small Caribbean nations with resident billionaires  Worldwide  there is one billionaire for every USD 170 billion in household wealth  Russia has one for every USD 11 billion  Worldwide  billionaires collectively account for 1%– 2% of total household wealth  in Russia today 110 billionaires own 35% of all wealth    2  As a propaganda term  In the political jargon and propaganda of Fascist Italy  Nazi Germany and the Communist International  western democratic states were referred to as plutocracies  with the implication being that a small number of extremely wealthy individuals were controlling the countries and holding them to ransom  Plutocracy replaced democracy and capitalism as the principal fascist term for the United States and Great Britain during the Second World War  For the Nazis  the term was often a code word for  the Jews    3  See also  Anarcho capitalism  Corporatocracy  Oligarchy  Plutonomy  Corporate republic  Meritocracy  Neo feudalism  4  References  5  Further reading  Howard  Milford Wriarson
