In statistics  a power law is a functional relationship between two quantities  where one quantity varies as a power of another  For instance  the number of cities having a certain population size is found to vary as a power of the size of the population  Empirical power law distributions hold only approximately or over a limited range   1  Empirical examples of power laws  The distributions of a wide variety of physical  biological  and man made phenomena approximately follow a power law over a wide range of magnitudes  these include the sizes of earthquakes  craters on the moon and of solar flares  the foraging pattern of various species  the sizes of activity patterns of neuronal populations  the frequencies of words in most languages  frequencies of family names  the species richness in clades of organisms  the sizes of power outages  wars  criminal charges per convict  and many other quantities  Few empirical distributions fit a power law for all their values  but rather follow a power law in the tail  Acoustic attenuation follows frequency power laws within wide frequency bands for many complex media  Allometric scaling laws for relationships between biological variables are among the best known power law functions in nature   2  Properties of power laws  2 1  Scale invariance  One attribute of power laws is their scale invariance  Given a relation   scaling the argument by a constant factor causes only a proportionate scaling of the function itself  That is   That is  scaling by a constant simply multiplies the original power law relation by the constant   Thus  it follows that all power laws with a particular scaling exponent are equivalent up to constant factors  since each is simply a scaled version of the others  This behavior is what produces the linear relationship when logarithms are taken of both and   and the straight line on the log log plot is often called the signature of a power law  With real data  such straightness is a necessary  but not sufficient  condition for the data following a power law relation  In fact  there are many ways to generate finite amounts of data that mimic this signature behavior  but  in their asymptotic limit  are not true power laws  e g   if the generating process of some data follows a Log normal distribution   Thus  accurately fitting and validating power law models is an active area of research in statistics   2 2  No average  Power laws have a well defined mean only if the exponent exceeds 2 and have a finite variance only when the exponent exceeds 3  most identified power laws in nature have exponents such that the mean is well defined but the variance is not  implying they are capable of black swan behaviour This can be seen in the following thought experiment  imagine a room with your friends and estimate the average monthly income in the room  Now imagine the world s richest person entering the room  with a monthly income of about 1 billion US$  What happens to the average income in the room  Income is distributed according to a power law known as the Pareto distribution  for example  the net worth of Americans is distributed according to a power law with an exponent of 2    On the one hand  this makes it incorrect to apply traditional statistics that are based on variance and standard deviation  such as regression analysis   On the other hand  this also allows for cost efficient interventions  For example  given that car exhaust is distributed according to a power law among cars  very few cars contribute to most contamination  it would be sufficient to eliminate those very few cars from the road to reduce total exhaust substantially   2 3  Universality  The equivalence of power laws with a particular scaling exponent can have a deeper origin in the dynamical processes that generate the power law relation  In physics  for example  phase transitions in thermodynamic systems are associated with the emergence of power law distributions of certain quantities  whose exponents are referred to as the critical exponents of the system  Diverse systems with the same critical exponents—that is  which display identical scaling behaviour as they approach criticality—can be shown  via renormalization group theory  to share the same fundamental dynamics  For instance  the behavior of water and CO2 at their boiling points fall in the same universality class because they have identical critical exponents  In fact  almost all material phase transitions are described by a small set of universality classes  Similar observations have been made  though not as comprehensively  for various self organized critical systems  where the critical point of the system is an attractor  Formally  this sharing of dynamics is referred to as universality  and systems with precisely the same critical exponents are said to belong to the same universality class   3  Power law functions  Scientific interest in power law relations stems partly from the ease with which certain general classes of mechanisms generate them  The demonstration of a power law relation in some data can point to specific kinds of mechanisms that might underlie the natural phenomenon in question  and can indicate a deep connection with other  seemingly unrelated systems  see also universality above  The ubiquity of power law relations in physics is partly due to dimensional constraints  while in complex systems  power laws are often thought to be signatures of hierarchy or of specific stochastic processes  A few notable examples of power laws are the Gutenberg–Richter law for earthquake sizes  Pareto s law of income distribution  structural self similarity of fractals  and scaling laws in biological systems  Research on the origins of power law relations  and efforts to observe and validate them in the real world  is an active topic of research in many fields of science  including physics  computer science  linguistics  geophysics  neuroscience  sociology  economics and more   However much of the recent interest in power laws comes from the study of probability distributions  The distributions of a wide variety of quantities seem to follow the power law form  at least in their upper tail  large events   The behavior of these large events connects these quantities to the study of theory of large deviations  also called extreme value theory   which considers the frequency of extremely rare events like stock market crashes and large natural disasters  It is primarily in the study of statistical distributions that the name  power law  is used  in other areas  such as physics and engineering  a power law functional form with a single term and a positive integer exponent is typically regarded as a polynomial function   In empirical contexts  an approximation to a power law often includes a deviation term   which can represent uncertainty in the observed values  perhaps measurement or sampling errors  or provide a simple way for observations to deviate from the power law function  perhaps for stochastic reasons    Mathematically  a strict power law cannot be a probability distribution  but a distribution that is a truncated power function is possible  for where the exponent is greater than 1  otherwise the tail has infinite area   the minimum value is needed otherwise the distribution has infinite area as x approaches 0  and the constant C is a scaling factor to ensure that the total area is 1  as required by a probability distribution  More often one uses an asymptotic power law – one that is only true in the limit  see power law probability distributions below for details  Typically the exponent falls in the range   though not always   3 1  Examples of power law functions  More than a hundred

power law with an exponential cutoff is simply a power law multiplied by an exponential function   3 2 3  Curved power law  4  Power law probability distributions  In a looser sense  a power law probability distribution is a distribution whose density function  or mass function in the discrete case  has the form  where   and is a slowly varying function  which is any function that satisfies with constant and   This property of follows directly from the requirement that be asymptotically scale invariant  thus  the form of only controls the shape and finite extent of the lower tail  For instance  if is the constant function  then we have a power law that holds for all values of   In many cases  it is convenient to assume a lower bound from which the law holds  Combining these two cases  and where is a continuous variable  the power law has the form  where the pre factor to is the normalizing constant  We can now consider several properties of this distribution  For instance  its moments are given by  which is only well defined for   That is  all moments diverge  when   the average and all higher order moments are infinite  when   the mean exists  but the variance and higher order moments are infinite  etc  For finite size samples drawn from such distribution  this behavior implies that the central moment estimators  like the mean and the variance  for diverging moments will never converge – as more data is accumulated  they continue to grow  These power law probability distributions are also called Pareto type distributions  distributions with Pareto tails  or distributions with regularly varying tails   Another kind of power law distribution  which does not satisfy the general form above  is the power law with an exponential cutoff  In this distribution  the exponential decay term eventually overwhelms the power law behavior at very large values of   This distribution does not scale and is thus not asymptotically a power law  however  it does approximately scale over a finite region before the cutoff   Note that the pure form above is a subset of this family  with    This distribution is a common alternative to the asymptotic power law distribution because it naturally captures finite size effects  For instance  although the Gutenberg&ndash Richter law is commonly cited as an example of a power law distribution  the distribution of earthquake magnitudes cannot scale as a power law in the limit because there is a finite amount of energy in the Earth s crust and thus there must be some maximum size to an earthquake  As the scaling behavior approaches this size  it must taper off   The Tweedie distributions are a family of statistical models characterized by closure under additive and reproductive convolution as well as under scale transformation  Consequently these models all express a power law relationship between the variance and the mean  These models have a fundamental role as foci of mathematical convergence similar to the role that the normal distribution has as a focus in the central limit theorem  This convergence effect explains why the variance to mean power law manifests so widely in natural processes  as with Taylor s law in ecology and with fluctuation scaling in physics  It can also be shown that this variance to mean power law  when demonstrated by the method of expanding bins  implies the presence of 1 f noise and that 1 f noise can arise as a consequence of this Tweedie convergence effect   4 1  Graphical methods for identification  Although more sophisticated and robust methods have been proposed  the most frequently used graphical methods of identifying power law probability distributions using random samples are Pareto quantile quantile plots  or Pareto Q Q plots   mean residual life plots and log log plots  Another  more robust graphical method uses bundles of residual quantile functions   Please keep in mind that power law distributions are also called Pareto type distributions   It is assumed here that a random sample is obtained from a probability distribution  and that we want to know if the tail of the distribution follows a power law  in other words  we want to know if the distribution has a  Pareto tail    Here  the random sample is called  the data    Pareto Q Q plots compare the quantiles of the log transformed data to the corresponding quantiles of an exponential distribution with mean 1  or to the quantiles of a standard Pareto distribution  by plotting the former versus the latter  If the resultant scatterplot suggests that the plotted points   asymptotically converge  to a straight line  then a power law distribution should be suspected  A limitation of Pareto Q Q plots is that they behave poorly when the tail index  also called Pareto index  is close to 0  because Pareto Q Q plots are not designed to identify distributions with slowly varying tails   On the other hand  in its version for identifying power law probability distributions  the mean residual life plot consists of first log transforming the data  and then plotting the average of those log transformed data that are higher than the i th order statistic versus the i th order statistic  for i   1       n  where n is the size of the random sample  If the resultant scatterplot suggests that the plotted points tend to  stabilize  about a horizontal straight line  then a power law distribution should be suspected  Since the mean residual life plot is very sensitive to outliers  it is not robust   it usually produces plots that are difficult to interpret  for this reason  such plots are usually called Hill horror plots  Log log plots are an alternative way of graphically examining the tail of a distribution using a random sample  This method consists of plotting the logarithm of an estimator of the probability that a particular number of the distribution occurs versus the logarithm of that particular number  Usually  this estimator is the proportion of times that the number occurs in the data set  If the points in the plot tend to  converge  to a straight line for large numbers in the x axis  then the researcher concludes that the distribution has a power law tail  Examples of the application of these types of plot have been published  A disadvantage of these plots is that  in order for them to provide reliable results  they require huge amounts of data  In addition  they are appropriate only for discrete  or grouped  data   Another graphical method for the identification of power law probability distributions using random samples has been proposed  This methodology consists of plotting a bundle for the log transformed sample  Originally proposed as a tool to explore the existence of moments and the moment generation function using random samples  the bundle methodology is based on residual quantile functions  RQFs   also called residual percentile functions  which provide a full characterization of the tail behavior of many well known probability distributions  including power law distributions  distributions with other types of heavy tails  and even non heavy tailed distributions  Bundle plots do not have the disadvantages of Pareto Q Q plots  mean residual life plots and log log plots mentioned above  they are robust to outliers  allow visually identifying power laws with small values of   and do not demand the collection of much data   In addition  other types of tail behavior can be identified using bundle plots   4 2  Plotting power law distributions  In general  power law distributions are plotted on doubly logarithmic axes  which emphasizes the upper tail region  The most convenient way to do this is via the  complementary  cumulative distribution  cdf      Note that the cdf is also a power law function  but with a smaller scaling exponent  For data  an equivalent form of the cdf is the rank frequency approach  in which we first sort the observed values in ascending order  and plot them against the vector    Although it can be convenient to log bin the data  or otherwise smooth the probability density  mass  function directly  these methods introduce an implicit bias in the representation of the data  and thus should be avoided  The cdf  on the other hand  introduces no bias in the data and preserves the linear signature on doubly logarithmic axes   4 3  Estimating the exponent from empirical data  There are many ways of estimating the value of the scaling exponent for a power law tail  however not all of them yield unbiased and consistent answers  Some of the most reliable techniques are often based on the method of maximum likelihood  Alternative methods are often based on making a linear regression on either the log log probability  the log log cumulative distribution function  or on log binned data  but these approaches should be avoided as they can all lead to highly biased estimates of the scaling exponent   4 3 1  Maximum likelihood  For real valued  independent and identically distributed data  we fit a power law distribution of the form  to the data   where the coefficient is included to ensure that the distribution is normalized  Given a choice for   a simple derivation by this method yields the estimator equation  where are the data points   This estimator exhibits a small finite sample size bias of order   which is small when n   100  Further  the uncertainty in the estimation can be derived from the maximum likelihood argument  and has the form   This estimator is equivalent to the popular Hill estimator from quantitative finance and extreme value theory   For a set of n integer valued data points   again where each   the maximum likelihood exponent is the solution to the transcendental equation  where is the incomplete zeta function  The uncertainty in this estimate follows the same formula as for the continuous equation  However  the two equations for are not equivalent  and the continuous version should not be applied to discrete data  nor vice versa   Further  both of these estimators require the choice of   For functions with a non trivial function  choosing too small produces a significant bias in   while choosing it too large increases the uncertainty in   and reduces the statistical power of our model  In general  the best choice of depends strongly on the particular form of the lower tail  represented by above   More about these methods  and the conditions under which they can be used  can be found in   Further  this comprehensive review article provides  Matlab  R and C++  for estimation and testing routines for power law distributions   4 3 2  Kolmogorov–Smirnov estimation  Another method for the estimation of the power law exponent  which does not assume independent and identically distributed  iid  data  uses the minimization of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic    between the cumulative distribution functions of the data and the power law   with  where and denote the cdfs of the data and the power law with exponent   respectively  As this method does not assume iid data  it provides an alternative way to determine the power law exponent for data sets in which the temporal correlation can not be ignored   4 3 3  Two point fitting method  This criterion can be applied for the estimation of power law exponent in the case of scale free distributions and provides a more convergent estimate than the maximum likelihood method  It has been applied to study probability distributions of fracture apertures  In some contexts the probability distribution is described  not by the cumulative distribution function  by the cumulative frequency of a property X  defined as the number of elements per meter  or area unit  second etc   for which X   x applies  where x is a variable real number  As an example  the cumulative distribution of the fracture aperture  X  for a sample of N elements is defined as  the number of fractures per meter having aperture greater than x   Use of cumulative frequency has some advantages  e g  it allows one to put on the same diagram data gathered from sample lines of different lengths at different scales  e g  from outcrop and from microscope    4 3 4  R function  The following function estimates the exponent in R  plotting the log log data and the fitted line   5  Validating power laws  Although power law relations are attractive for many theoretical reasons  demonstrating that data do indeed follow a power law relation requires more than simply fitting a particular model to the data  For example log normal distributions are often mistaken for power law distributions  For example  Gibrat s law about proportional growth processes can actually produce limiting distributions that are lognormal  although their log log plots look linear  An explanation of this is that although the logarithm of the lognormal density function is quadratic in   yielding a  bowed  shape in a log log plot  if the quadratic term is small relative to the linear term then the result can appear almost linear  Therefore a log log plot that is slightly  bowed  downwards can reflect a log normal distribution – not a power law  In general  many alternative functional forms can appear to follow a power law form for some extent  Also  researchers usually have to face the problem of deciding whether or not a real world probability distribution follows a power law  As a solution to this problem  Diaz proposed a graphical methodology based on random samples that allow visually discerning between different types of tail behavior  This methodology uses bundles of residual quantile functions  also called percentile residual life functions  which characterize many different types of distribution tails  including both heavy and non heavy tails   One method to validate a power law relation tests many orthogonal predictions of a particular generative mechanism against data  Simply fitting a power law relation to a particular kind of data is not considered a rational approach  As such  the validation of power law claims remains a very active field of research in many areas of modern science   6  See also  Acoustic attenuation  Allometry  Empirical relationship  Fat tailed distribution  Finite time singularity  Fractional calculus  Fractional dynamics  Heavy tailed
