Stephen J   Steve  Ditko  born November 2  1927  is an American comic book artist and writer best known as the artist and co creator  with Stan Lee  of the Marvel Comics heroes Spider Man and Doctor Strange   Ditko studied under Batman artist Jerry Robinson at the Cartoonist and Illustrators School in New York City  He began his professional career in 1953  working in the studio of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby  beginning as an inker and coming under the influence of artist Mort Meskin  During this time  he then began his long association with Charlton Comics  where he did work in the genres of science fiction  horror  and mystery  He also co created the superhero Captain Atom in 1960   During the 1950s  Ditko also drew for Atlas Comics  a forerunner of Marvel Comics  He went on to contribute much significant work to Marvel  including co creating Spider Man  who would become the company s flagship character  Additionally  he co created the supernatural hero Doctor Strange and made important contributions to the Hulk and Iron Man  In 1966  after being the exclusive artist on The Amazing Spider Man and the  Doctor Strange  feature in Strange Tales  Ditko left Marvel for reasons never specified   Ditko continued to work for Charlton and also DC Comics  making major contributions  including a revamp of the long running character Blue Beetle  and creating or co creating the Question  the Creeper  Shade  the Changing Man  and Hawk and Dove  Ditko also began contributing to small independent publishers  where he created Mr  A  a hero reflecting the influence of Ayn Rand s philosophy of Objectivism  Since the 1960s  Ditko has declined most interviews  stating that it is his work he offers readers  and not his personality   Ditko was inducted into the comics industry s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990  and into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994   1  Early life  Stephen J  Ditko was born in Johnstown  Pennsylvania on November 2  1927  the son of first generation Americans of Slovak descent  Stephen Ditko  an artistically talented master carpenter at a steel mill  and Anna  a homemaker  The second eldest child in a working class family  he was preceded by sister Anna Marie and followed in uncertain order by sister Betty and brother Patrick  Inspired by his father s love of newspaper comic strips  particularly Hal Foster s Prince Valiant  Ditko found his interest in comics accelerated by the introduction of superhero Batman in 1940  and by Will Eisner s The Spirit  which appeared in a tabloid sized comic book insert in Sunday newspapers   Good with his hands  Ditko in junior high school was part of a group of students who crafted wooden models of German airplanes to aid civilian World War II aircraft spotters  Upon graduating from Johnstown High School in 1945  he enlisted in the U S  Army on October 26  1945  and did military service in postwar Germany  where he drew comics for an Army newspaper   Following his discharge  Ditko learned that his idol  Batman artist Jerry Robinson  was teaching at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School  later the School of Visual Arts  in New York City  Moving there in 1950  he enrolled in the art school under the G I  Bill  Robinson found the young student  a very hard worker who really focused on his drawing  and someone who  could work well with other writers as well as write his own stories and create his own characters   and he helped Ditko acquire a scholarship for the following year   He was in my class for two years  four or five days a week  five hours a night  It was very intense   Robinson  who invited artists and editors to speak with his class  once brought in Stan Lee  then editor of Marvel Comics  1950s precursor  Atlas Comics  and   I think that was when Stan first saw Steve s work    2  Career  Ditko began professionally illustrating comic books in early 1953  drawing writer Bruce Hamilton s science fiction story  Stretching Things  for the Key Publications imprint Stanmor Publications  which sold the story to Ajax Farrell  where it finally found publication in Fantastic Fears #5  cover dated Feb  1954   Ditko s first published work was his second professional story  the six page  Paper Romance  in Daring Love #1  Oct  1953   published by the Key imprint Gillmor Magazines   Shortly afterward  Ditko found work at the studio of celebrated writer artists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby  who had created Captain America and other characters and had instituted numerous industry innovations  Beginning as an inker on backgrounds  Ditko was soon working with and learning from Mort Meskin  an artist whose work he had long admired   Meskin was fabulous   Ditko once recalled   I couldn t believe the ease with which he drew  strong compositions  loose pencils  yet complete  detail without clutter  I loved his stuff   Ditko s known assistant work includes aiding inker Meskin on the Jack Kirby pencil work of Harvey Comics  Captain 3 D #1  Dec  1953   For his own third published story  Ditko penciled and inked the six page  A Hole in His Head  in Black Magic vol  4  #3  Dec  1953   published by Simon & Kirby s Crestwood Publications imprint Prize Comics   Ditko then began a long association with the Derby  Connecticut publisher Charlton Comics  a low budget division of a company best known for song lyric magazines  Beginning with the cover of The Thing #12  Feb  1954  and the eight page vampire story  Cinderella  in that issue  Ditko would continue to work intermittently for Charlton until the company s demise in 1986  producing science fiction  horror and mystery stories  as well as co creating Captain Atom  with writer Joe Gill  in Space Adventures #33  March 1960   He first went on hiatus from the company  and comics altogether  in mid 1954  when he contracted tuberculosis and returned to his parents  home in Johnstown to recuperate   2 1  Marvel Comics  After he recovered and moved back to New York City in late 1955  Ditko began drawing for Atlas Comics  the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics  beginning with the four page  There ll Be Some Changes Made  in Journey into Mystery #33  April 1956   this debut tale would be reprinted in Marvel s Curse of the Weird #4  March 1994   Ditko would go on to contribute a large number of stories  many considered classic  to Atlas Marvel s Strange Tales and the newly launched Amazing Adventures  Strange Worlds  Tales of Suspense and Tales to Astonish  issues of which would typically open with a Kirby drawn monster story  followed by one or two twist ending thrillers or sci fi tales drawn by Don Heck  Paul Reinman  or Joe Sinnott  all capped by an often surreal  sometimes self reflexive short by Ditko and writer editor Stan Lee   These Lee Ditko short stories proved so popular that Amazing Adventures was reformatted to feature such stories exclusively beginning with issue #7  Dec  1961   when the comic was rechristened Amazing Adult Fantasy — a name intended to reflect its more  sophisticated  nature  as likewise the new tagline  The magazine that respects your intelligence   Lee in 2009 described these  short  five page filler strips that Steve and I did together   originally  placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill   as  odd fantasy tales that I d dream up with O  Henry type endings   Giving an early example of what would later be known as the  Marvel Method  of writer artist collaboration  Lee said   All I had to do was give Steve a one line description of the plot and he d be off and running  He d take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect    2 1 1  Creation of Spider Man  After Marvel Comics editor in chief Stan Lee obtained permission from publisher Martin Goodman to create a new  ordinary teen  superhero named  Spider Man   Lee originally approached his leading artist  Jack Kirby  Kirby told Lee about his own 1950s character conception  variously called the Silver Spider and Spiderman  in which an orphaned boy finds a magic ring that gives him superpowers  Comics historian Greg Theakston says Lee and Kirby  immediately sat down for a story conference  and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages   A day or two later   Kirby showed Lee the first six pages  and  as Lee recalled   I hated the way he was doing it  Not that he did it badly — it just wasn t the character I wanted  it was too heroic    Lee turned to Ditko  who developed a visual motif Lee found satisfactory  although Lee would later replace Ditko s original cover with one penciled by Kirby  Ditko said   The Spider Man pages Stan showed me were nothing like the  eventually  published character  In fact  the only drawings of Spider Man were on the splash i e   page 1  and at the end  where  Kirby had the guy leaping at you with a web gun    Anyway  the first five pages took place in the home  and the kid finds a ring and turns into Spider Man    Ditko also recalled that   One of the first things I did was to work up a costume  A vital  visual part of the character  I had to know how he looked     before I did any breakdowns  For example  A clinging power so he wouldn t have hard shoes or boots  a hidden wrist shooter versus a web gun and holster  etc      I wasn t sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character s face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face  It would also add mystery to the character       Much earlier  in a rare contemporaneous account  Ditko described his and Lee s contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2  Summer 1965    Stan Lee thought the name up  I did costume  web gimmick on wrist & spider signal   He added he would continue drawing Spider Man   i f nothing better comes along   That same year  he expressed to the fanzine Voice of Comicdom  regarding a poll of  Best Liked  fan created comics   It seems a shame  since comics themselves have so little variety of stories and styles that you would deliberately restrict your own creative efforts to professional comics    shallow range  What is  Best Liked  by most readers is what they are most familiar in seeing and any policy based on readers likes has to end up with a lot of look a like strips  You have a great opportunity to show everyone a whole new range of ideas  unlimited types of stories and styles—why FLUB it    From 1958 to either 1966  or 1968  accounts differ   Ditko shared a Manhattan studio at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton  an art school classmate  When either artist was under deadline pressure  it was not uncommon for them to pitch in and help the other with his assignment  Ditko biographer Blake Bell  without citing sources  said   At one time in history  Ditko denied ever touching Stanton s work  even though Stanton himself said they would each dabble in each other s art  mainly spot inking   and the introduction to one book of Stanton s work says   Eric Stanton drew his pictures in India ink  and they were then hand coloured by Ditko   In a 1988 interview with Theakston  Stanton recalled that although his contribution to Spider Man was  almost nil   he and Ditko had  worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas  But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own    I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands    Spider Man debuted in Amazing Fantasy #15  Aug  1962   the final issue of that science fiction fantasy anthology series  When the issue proved to be a top seller  Spider Man was given his own series  The Amazing Spider Man  Lee and Ditko s collaboration on the series saw the creation of many of the character s best known antagonists including Doctor Octopus in issue #3  July 1963   the Sandman in #4  Sept  1963   the Lizard in #6  Nov  1963   Electro in #9  March 1964   and the Green Goblin in #14  July 1964   Ditko eventually demanded credit for the plotting he was contributing under the Marvel Method  Lee concurred  and starting with #25  June 1965   Ditko received plot credit for the stories   One of the most celebrated issues of the Lee Ditko run is #33  Feb  1966   the third part of the story arc  If This Be My Destiny       and featuring the dramatic scene of Spider Man  through force of will and thoughts of family  escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery  Comics historian Les Daniels noted   Steve Ditko squeezes every ounce of anguish out of Spider Man s predicament  complete with visions of the uncle he failed and the aunt he has sworn to save   Peter David observed   After his origin  this two page sequence from Amazing Spider Man #33 is perhaps the best loved sequence from the Stan Lee Steve Ditko era   Steve Saffel stated the  full page Ditko image from The Amazing Spider Man #33 is one of the most powerful ever to appear in the series and influenced writers and artists for many years to come   Matthew K  Manning wrote that  Ditko s illustrations for the first few pages of this Lee story included what would become one of the most iconic scenes in Spider Man s history   The story was chosen as #15 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel s readers in 2001  Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story   These first five pages are a modern day equivalent to Shakespeare as Parker s soliloquy sets the stage for his next action  And with dramatic pacing and storytelling  Ditko delivers one of the great sequences in all comics    2 1 2  Doctor Strange and other characters  After drawing the final issue of The Incredible Hulk  #6  March 1963   Ditko co created the supernatural hero Doctor Strange  in Strange Tales #110  July 1963   Ditko and Lee shortly thereafter relaunched a Hulk series as a short feature in the anthology Tales to Astonish  beginning with issue #60  Oct  1964   Ditko  inked by George Roussos  penciled the feature through #67  May 1965   Ditko designed the Hulk s primary antagonist  the Leader  in #62  Dec  1964    Ditko also penciled the Iron Man feature in Tales of Suspense #47–49  Nov  1963 – Jan  1964   with various inkers  The first of these debuted the initial version of Iron Man s modern red and golden armor  though whether Ditko or cover penciler and principal character designer Jack Kirby designed the costume is uncertain   Though often overshadowed by his Amazing Spider Man work  Ditko s  Doctor Strange  artwork has been equally acclaimed  for their surrealistic mystical landscapes and increasingly psychedelic visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students   People who read  Doctor Strange  thought people at Marvel must be heads  i e  drug users    recalled then associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer Roy Thomas in 1971   because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms  But     I don t use hallucinogens  nor do I think any artists do    Eventually Lee & Ditko would take Strange into ever more abstract realms  In an epic 17 issue story arc in Strange Tales #130–146  March 1965 – July 1966   Lee & Ditko introduced the cosmic character Eternity  who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos  As historian Bradford W  Wright describes   The cartoonist and fine artist Seth in 2003 described Ditko s style as  oddball for mainstream comics  Whereas Kirby s stuff clearly appealed to a boy s sensibility because there was so much raw power  Ditko s work was really delicate and cartoony  There was a sense of design to it  You can always recognize anything that Ditko designed because it s always flowery  There is a lot of embroidered detail in the art  which is almost psychedelic    Whichever feature he drew  Ditko s idiosyncratic  cleanly detailed  instantly recognizable art style  emphasizing mood and anxiety  found great favor with readers  The character of Spider Man and his troubled personal life meshed well with Ditko s own interests  which Lee eventually acknowledged by giving the artist plotting credits on the latter part of their 38 issue run  But after four years on the title  Ditko left Marvel  he and Lee had not been on speaking terms for some time  with art and editorial changes handled through intermediaries  The details of the rift remain uncertain  even to Lee  who confessed in 2003   I never really knew Steve on a personal level   Ditko later claimed it was Lee who broke off contact and disputed the long held belief that the disagreement was over the true identity of the Green Goblin   Stan never knew what he was getting in my Spider Man stories and covers until after  production manager  Sol Brodsky took the material from me     so there couldn t have been any disagreement or agreement  no exchanges     no problems between us concerning the Green Goblin or anything else from before issue #25 to my final issues   Spider Man successor artist John Romita  in a 2010 deposition  recalled that Lee and Ditko  ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything  cultural  social  historically  everything  they disagreed on characters      A friendly farewell was given to Ditko in the Bullpen Bulletins of Fantastic Four #52  July 1966    Steve recently told us he was leaving for personal reasons  After all these years  we re sorry to see him go  and we wish the talented guy success with his future endeavors    Regardless  said Lee in 2007   Quite a few years ago I met him up at the Marvel offices when I was last in New York  And we spoke  he s a hell of a nice guy and it was very pleasant      I haven t heard from him since that meeting    2 2  Charlton and DC Comics  Back at Charlton — where the page rate was low but creators were allowed greater freedom — Ditko worked on such characters as Blue Beetle  1967–1968   the Question  1967–1968   and Captain Atom  1965–1967   returning to the character he d co created in 1960  In addition  in 1966–1967  he drew 16 stories  most of them written by Archie Goodwin for Warren Publishing s horror comic magazines Creepy and Eerie  most of which were done using ink wash   In 1967  Ditko gave his Objectivist ideas ultimate expression in the form of Mr  A  published in Wally Wood s independent title witzend # 3  Ditko s hard line against criminals was controversial and he continued to produce Mr  A stories and one pagers until the end of the 1970s  Ditko returned to Mr  A in 2000 and in 2009  Ditko moved to DC Comics in 1968  where he co created the Creeper in Showcase #73  April 1968  with Don Segall  under editor Murray Boltinoff  DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that Ditko s art on the Creeper stories made  them look unlike anything else being published by DC at the time   Ditko co created the team Hawk and Dove in Showcase #75  June 1968   with writer Steve Skeates  Around this time  he penciled the lead story  written and inked by Wally Wood  in Wood s early mature audience  independent comics publication Heroes  Inc  Presents Cannon  1969    Ditko s stay at DC was short — he would work on all six issues of the Creeper s own title  Beware the Creeper  June 1968 – April 1969   though leaving midway through the final one — and the reasons for his departure uncertain  But while at DC  Ditko recommended Charlton staffer Dick Giordano to the company  who would go on to become a top DC penciller  inker  editor  and ultimately  in 1981  the managing editor   From this time up through the mid 1970s  Ditko worked exclusively for Charlton and various small press independent publishers  Frank McLaughlin  Charlton s art director during this period  describes Ditko as living  in a local hotel in Derby for a while  He was a very happy go lucky guy with a great sense of humor at that time  and always supplied the  female  color separators with candy and other little gifts    For Charlton in 1974 he did Liberty Belle backup stories in E Man and conceived Killjoy  Ditko produced much work for Charlton s science fiction and horror titles  as well as for former Marvel publisher Martin Goodman s start up line Atlas Seaboard Comics  where he co created the superhero the Destructor with writer Archie Goodwin  and penciled all four issues of the namesake series  Feb –Aug  1975   the first two of which were inked by fellow comics legend Wally Wood  Ditko worked on the second and third issues of Tiger Man and the third issue of Morlock 2001  with Bernie Wrightson inking   2 3  Latter day Ditko  Ditko returned to DC Comics in 1975  creating a short lived title  Shade  the Changing Man  1977–1978   Shade was later revived  without Ditko s involvement  in DC s mature audience imprint Vertigo  With writer Paul Levitz  he co created the four issue sword and sorcery series Stalker  1975–1976   Ditko and writer Gerry Conway produced the first issue of a short lived Man Bat series  He also revived the Creeper and did such various other jobs as a short Demon backup series in 1979 and stories in DC s horror and science fiction anthologies  Editor Jack C  Harris hired Ditko as guest artist on several issues of The Legion of Super Heroes  a decision which garnered a mixed reaction from the title s readership  Ditko also drew the Prince Gavyn version of Starman in Adventure Comics #467–478  1980   He then decamped to do work for a variety of publishers  briefly contributing to DC again in the mid 1980s  with four pinups of his characters for Who s Who in the DC Universe and a pinup for Superman #400  Oct  1984  and its companion portfolio   Ditko returned to Marvel in 1979  taking over Jack Kirby s Machine Man  drawing The Micronauts and Captain Universe  and continuing to freelance for the company into the late 1990s  A Godzilla story by Ditko and Marv Wolfman was changed into a Dragon Lord story published in Marvel Spotlight  Ditko and writer Tom DeFalco introduced the Speedball character in The Amazing Spider Man Annual #21  1988  and Ditko drew a ten issue series based on the character   In 1982  he also began freelancing for the early independent comics label Pacific Comics  beginning with Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers #6  Sept  1982   in which he introduced the superhero Missing Man  with Mark Evanier scripting to Ditko s plot and art  Subsequent Missing Man stories appeared in Pacific Presents #1–3  Oct  1982 – March 1984   with Ditko scripting the former and collaborating with longtime friend Robin Snyder on the script for the latter two  Ditko also created The Mocker for Pacific  in Silver Star #2  April 1983    For Eclipse Comics  he contributed a story featuring his character Static  no relation to the later Milestone Comics character  in Eclipse Monthly #1–3  Aug –Oct  1983   introducing supervillain the Exploder in #2  With writer Jack C  Harris  Ditko drew the backup feature  The Faceless Ones  in First Comics  Warp #2–4  April–June 1983   Working with that same writer and others  Ditko drew a handful of the Fly  Fly Girl and Jaguar stories for The Fly #2–8  July 1983 – Aug  1984   for Archie Comics  short lived 1980s superhero line  in a rare latter day instance of Ditko inking another artist  he inked penciler Dick Ayers on the Jaguar story in The Fly #9  Oct  1984   Western Publishing in 1982 announced a series by Ditko and Harris would appear in a new science fiction comic  Astral Frontiers  but that title never materialized   In 1992 Ditko worked with writer Will Murray to produce one of his last original characters for Marvel Comics  the satirical superheroine Squirrel Girl  who debuted in Marvel Super Heroes vol  2  #8  a k a  Marvel Super Heroes Winter Special  Jan  1992    In 1993  he did the Dark Horse Comics one shot The Safest Place in the World  For the Defiant Comics series Dark Dominion  he drew issue #0  which was released as a set of trading cards  In 1995  he pencilled a four issue series for Marvel based on the Phantom 2040 animated TV series  This included a poster that was inked by John Romita Sr  Steve Ditko s Strange Avenging Tales was announced as a quarterly series from Fantagraphics Books  although it only ran one issue  Feb  1997  due to publicly unspecified disagreements between Ditko and the publisher   The New York Times assessed in 2008 that   By the  70s he was regarded as a slightly old fashioned odd ball  by the  80s he was a commercial has been  picking up wretched work for hire gigs     following the example of  Ayn  Rand s John Galt  Ditko hacked out moneymaking work  saving his care for the crabbed Objectivist screeds he published with tiny presses  And boy  could Ditko hack  seeing samples of his Transformers coloring book and his Big Boy comic is like hearing Orson Welles sell frozen peas    Ditko retired from mainstream comics in 1998  His later work for Marvel and DC included such established superheroes as the Sub Mariner  in Marvel Comics Presents  and newer  licensed characters such as the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers  The last mainstream character he created was Marvel s Longarm in Shadows & Light #1  Feb  1998   in a self inked  12 page Iron Man story  A Man s Reach       scripted by Len Wein  His final mainstream work was a five page New Gods story for DC Comics   Infinitely Gentle Infinitely Suffering   inked by Mick Gray and believed to be intended for the 2000–2002 Orion series but not published until the 2008 trade paperback Tales of the New Gods   Since then  Ditko s solo work has been published intermittently by Robin Snyder  who was his editor at Charlton  Archie Comics  and Renegade Press in the 1980s  The Snyder publications have included a number of original books as well as reprints such as Static  The Missing Man  The Mocker and  in 2002  Avenging World  a collection of stories and essays spanning 30 years   In 2008  Ditko and Snyder released The Avenging Mind  a 32 page essay publication featuring several pages of new artwork  and Ditko  Etc     a 32 page comic book composed of brief vignettes and editorial cartoons  Releases have continued in that format  with stories introducing such characters as the Hero  Miss Eerie  the Cape  the Madman  the Grey Negotiator  the    and the Outline  He said in 2012 of his self published efforts  “I do those because that’s all they’ll let me do    In addition to the new material  Ditko and Snyder have reprinted earlier Ditko material  In 2010 they published a new edition of the 1973 Mr  A comic and a selection of Ditko covers in The Cover Series  In 2011 they published a new edition of the 1975 comic    Wha      Ditko s H  Series   Two  lost  stories drawn by Ditko in 1978 have been published by DC in hardcover collections of the artist s work  A Creeper story scheduled for the never published Showcase #106 appears in The Creeper by Steve Ditko  2010  and an unpublished Shade  the Changing Man story appears in The Steve Ditko Omnibus Vol  1  2011   A Hulk and the Human Torch story written by Jack C  Harris and drawn by Ditko in the 1980s was published by Marvel as Incredible Hulk and the Human Torch  From the Marvel Vault #1 in August 2011   3  Personal life  As of mid 2012  Ditko continues to work at a studio in Manhattan s Midtown West neighborhood  He has refused to give interviews or make public appearances since the 1960s  explaining in 1969 that   When I do a job  it s not my personality that I m offering the readers but my artwork  It s not what I m like that counts  it s what I did and how well it was done     I produce a product  a comic art story  Steve Ditko is the brand name   He has  however  contributed numerous essays to Snyder s fanzine The Comics   Ditko is an ardent supporter and advocate of the philosophy of Objectivism   He has a nephew who is an artist  also named Steve Ditko  According to Will Eisner  Ditko has one son  but this may have conflated the nephew  as Ditko is not known to ever have married or had children   Ditko said in 2012 he had made no income on the four Spider Man movies released to that time   4  Awards and honors  1962 Alley Award for Best Short Story   Origin of Spider Man  by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko
