The University of Arizona  also referred to as U of A  UA  or Arizona  is a public research university located in Tucson  Arizona  United States  UA was the first university in the state of Arizona  founded in 1885  twenty seven years before the Arizona Territory achieved statehood   The university includes the University of Arizona College of Medicine  which operates a medical center in Tucson  and a separate 4 year M D  college in downtown Phoenix  As of the 2012 2013 calendar year  total enrollment was 40 223 students  The University of Arizona is governed by the Arizona Board of Regents

hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory s mental hospital  which carried a $100 000 allocation instead of the $25 000 allotted to the territory s only university  Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885  but at the time it was created as Arizona s normal school  and not a university   Tucson s contingent of legislators was delayed in reaching Prescott due to flooding on the Salt River and by the time they arrived back room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had already been made  Tucson was largely disappointed at receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize  With no parties willing to step forth and provide land for the new institution  the citizens of Tucson prepared to return the money to the Territorial Legislature until two gamblers and a saloon keeper decided to donate the land necessary to build the school  Classes met for the first time in 1891 with 32 students in Old Main  the first building constructed on the 40 acre campus  and still in use to this day  Because there were no high schools in Arizona Territory  the University maintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation   2  Academics  The University of Arizona offers 334 fields of study leading to bachelor s  master s  doctoral  and professional degrees  Academic departments and programs are organized into colleges and schools  Currently  grades are given on a strict 4 point scale with  A  worth 4   B  worth 3   C  worth 2   D  worth 1 and  E  worth zero points  In 2004  there were discussions with students and faculty that may lead the UA towards eventual usage of the plus minus grading system in future years  the university still uses the 4 points scale   2 1  Rankings  The Center for World University Rankings in 2014

university globally  The U of A laboratory designed and operated the atmospheric radiation investigations and imaging on the probe  The UA operates the HiRISE camera  a part of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter  UA receives more NASA grants annually than the next nine top NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory funded universities combined  As of June 2011  the UA s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory is actively

Telescope  the instrument will produce images 10 times sharper than those from the Earth orbiting Hubble Telescope  The telescope is set to be completed in 2016 at a cost of $500 million USD  Researchers from at least nine institutions are working to secure the funding for the project  The telescope will include seven 18 ton mirrors capable of providing clear images of volcanoes and riverbeds on Mars and mountains on the moon at a rate 40 times faster than the world s current large telescopes  The mirrors of the Giant Magellan Telescope will be built at the U of A and transported to a permanent mountaintop site in the Chilean Andes where the telescope will be constructed   Reaching Mars in March 2006  the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter contained the HiRISE camera  with Primary Investigator is scientist Alfred McEwen as the lead on the project  This NASA mission to Mars carried a UA designed camera is capturing the highest resolution images of the planet ever seen  The

them the 1927 main library  and Centennial Hall  were designed by Roy Place  a prominent Tucson architect  It was Place s use of red brick that set the tone for the red brick facades that are a basic and ubiquitous part of nearly all UA buildings  even those built in recent decades  Indeed  almost every UA building has red brick as a major component of the design  or at the very least  a stylistic accent to harmonize it with the other buildings on campus   The campus is roughly divided into quadrants  The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall  which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus  eastern border at Campbell Avenue  a major north south arterial street   The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and

central area  The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the  1976  main library   Speedway Boulevard  one of Tucson s primary east west arterial streets  traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s  several university buildings have been constructed north of this street  expanding into a neighborhood

a food court with such national chains as Burger King  Panda Express  Papa John s Pizza and Chick fil A   a new two level bookstore  that includes a counter for Clinique merchandise as well as an office supplies section sponsored by Staples with many of the same Staples branded items found in their regular stores   23 meeting rooms  eight lounge areas  including one dedicated to the USS Arizona   a computer lab  a U S  Post Office  a Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt  and a copy center named Fast Copy   The building was designed to mirror the USS Arizona  BB 39   A variety of sculptures pepper the premises  decorating the air with the chimes of dog tags or the colors of refracted light in honor of those who have served  A bell housed on the USS Arizona  one of the two bells rescued from the ship after the attack on Pearl Harbor  has a permanent home in the clock tower of the Student Union Memorial Center on campus  The bell first arrived on campus in July 1946  The bell is rung seven
