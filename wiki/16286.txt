Count Johann von Werth  1591 舑 16 January 1652   also Jan von Werth or in French Jean de Werth  was a German general of cavalry in the Thirty Years  War   1  Biography  Werth was born in 1591 at Büttgen in the Duchy of Jülich as the eldest son with eight more brothers and sisters  His parents  Johann von Wierdt  † 1606  and Elisabeth Streithoven   He belonged to the numerous class of the lesser nobility  and at an early age he left home to follow the career of a soldier of fortune in the Walloon cavalry of the Spanish service  In 1622  at the taking of Jülich  he won promotion to the rank of lieutenant  He served as a colonel of cavalry in the Bavarian army in 1630  He obtained the command of a regiment  both titular and effective  in 1632  and in 1633 and 1634 laid the foundations of his reputation as a swift and terrible leader of cavalry forays  His services were even more conspicuous in the great pitched Battle of Nördlingen  1634   after which the emperor made him a Freiherr of the Empire  and the elector of Bavaria gave him the rank of lieutenant field marshal  About this time he armed his regiment with the musket as well as the sword   In 1635 and 1636 Werth s forays extended into Lorraine and Luxembourg  after which he projected an expedition into the heart of France  Starting in July 1636  from the country of the lower Meuse  he raided far and wide  and even urged the cardinal infante  who commanded in chief  to  plant the double eagle on the Louvre   Though this was not attempted  Worth s horsemen appeared at Saint Denis before the uprising of the French national spirit in the shape of an army of fifty thousand men at Compiègne forced the invaders to retire whence they had come  The memory of this raid lasted long  and the name of  Jean de Wert  figures in folk songs and serves as a bogey to quiet unruly children   In 1637 Werth was once more in the Rhine valley  destroying convoys  relieving besieged towns and surprising the enemy s camps  In February 1638 he defeated the Weimar troops in an engagement at Rheinfelden  but shortly afterwards was made prisoner by Bernhard of Saxe Weimar  His hopes of being exchanged for the Swedish field marshal Gustaf Horn were disappointed for Bernhard had to deliver up his captive to the French  The terrible Jean de Wert was brought to Paris  amidst great rejoicings from the country people  He was lionized by the society of the capital  visited in prison by high ladies  who marvelled at his powers of drinking and his devotion to tobacco  So light was his captivity that he said that nothing bound him but his word of honour  However  he looked forward with anxiety for his release  which was delayed until March 1642 because the imperial government feared to see Horn at the head of the Swedish army and would not allow an exchange   When at last Werth reappeared in the field it was as general of cavalry in the imperial and Bavarian and Cologne services  His first campaign against the French marshal Guebriant was uneventful  but his second  1643  in which Baron Franz von Mercy was his commander in chief  ended with the victory of Tuttlingen  a surprise on a large scale  in which Werth naturally played the leading part  In 1644 he was in the lower Rhine country  but he returned to Mercy s headquarters in time to take a brilliant share in the battle of Freiburg  In the following year his resolution and bravery  and also his uncontrolled rashness  played the most conspicuous part in deciding the day at the second battle of Nördlingen  Mercy was killed in this action  and Werth succeeded to the command of the defeated army  but he was soon superseded by Field marshal Geleen  Werth was disappointed  but remained thoroughly loyal to his soldierly code of honour  and found an outlet for his anger in renewed military activity   In 1647 differences arose between the elector and the emperor as to the allegiance due from the Bavarian troops  in which  after long hesitation  Werth  fearing that the cause of the Empire and of the Catholic religion would be ruined if the elector resumed control of the troops  attempted to take his men over the Austrian border  But they refused to follow and  escaping with great difficulty from the elector s vengeance  Werth found a refuge in Austria  The emperor was grateful for his conduct in this affair  ordered the elector to rescind his ban  and made Werth a count  The last campaign of the war  1648  was uneventful  and shortly after its close he retired to live on the estates which he had bought in the course of his career  and on one of these  Benatek NE of Prague in Bohemia  a gift from the emperor  he died on 16 of January 1652  and was buried in the church of Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Benátky   2  Notes  3  References   Attribution  Endnotes   Lives F  W  Barthold  Berlin  1826   W  von Janko  Vienna  1874   F  Teicher  Augsburg  1877    4  External links
