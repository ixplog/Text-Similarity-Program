U 571 is a 2000 war film directed by Jonathan Mostow  and starring Matthew McConaughey  Bill Paxton  Harvey Keitel  Thomas Kretschmann  Jon Bon Jovi  Jack Noseworthy  Will Estes and Tom Guiry  In the film  a World War II German submarine is boarded in 1942 by disguised United States Navy submariners seeking to capture her Enigma cipher machine   The film was financially successful and generally well received by critics in the USA and won an Academy Award for sound editing  The fictitious plot attracted substantial criticism since  in reality  it was British personnel from who first captured a naval Enigma machine  from in the North Atlantic in May 1941   months before the United States had even entered the war  The anger over the inaccuracies even reached the British Parliament  where Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that the film was an  affront  to British sailors   The real was never involved in any such events  was not captured  and was in fact sunk in January 1944  off Ireland  by a Short Sunderland flying boat from No  461 Squadron  Royal Australian Air Force   U 571 was filmed in the Mediterranean Sea  near Rome and Malta   1  Plot  German U boat U 571 is immobilized by an Allied destroyer  The US Navy submarine S 33 has been modified to resemble a German U boat to steal the Enigma coding device and sink the U 571   During a storm  the S 33 comes across U 571 and sends a boarding party over  After securing the ship and transporting the captured crew back to the American S 33 sub  the S 33 gets sunk by the arrival of a German resupply sub  The captain of the S 33  Lieutenant Commander Dahlgren  wounded in the water  orders his men on the captured U boat to submerge  Lieutenant Tyler takes command of the enemy U boat and dives to engage the resupply sub in an underwater battle before destroying it   After making repairs and restoring power Tyler decides to route the disabled submarine to Land s End in Cornwall  England  They are spotted by a German plane which is unaware that the U 571 has been commandeered by Americans  a nearby German destroyer sends over a small contingent but right before boarders arrive  Tyler gives orders to fire a shot from the deck gun  destroying the German ship s radio room  and preventing it from reporting that the capture of a German sub and its Enigma machine and code books  The sub dives underneath the German ship  which then begins to drop depth charges to sink U 571   Tyler attempts to trick the destroyer into stopping its attack by ejecting debris and a corpse out of a torpedo tube  faking their own destruction  The German destroyer continues dropping depth charges  U 571  hiding at below   is damaged by the high water pressure  Control of the main ballast tanks is lost and the ship ascends uncontrollably  Tyler orders crewman Trigger to submerse himself in the bilge underwater to repressurize the torpedo tubes   Trigger uses an air hose to enter the flooded compartment  He closes the air valve to the torpedo tubes  but a second leak and broken valve are found  which Trigger can t reach  U 571 surfaces  unable to fire its last torpedo  The destroyer fires on the ship  which is heavily damaged and begins to flood  The first hit causes pipes to collapse  pinning Trigger s leg  after he has left the air hose behind  Unable to turn back  he reaches for the valve and closes it before he dies  The second the pressure is available  Tyler orders Tank to fire the final torpedo  The German destroyer is destroyed  As the crew sigh in relief  Tank reports Trigger s death  U 571 has taken severe damage and will not remain afloat for long  The crew abandons ship with the Enigma in their possession  The crew watch U571 as she slips beneath the waves  Floating aboard an inflatable lifeboat  they are eventually rescued by a US Navy PBY Catalina flying boat   2  Cast  Matthew McConaughey as Lieutenant Andrew Tyler  Bill Paxton as Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren

was generally well received by critics  with 78 out of the 115 critics tallied by review aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes giving the film positive reviews  resulting in a 68%  and the critical consensus  Excellent cinematography and an interesting plot accompanied by a talented cast and crew make U 571 a tense thriller   The movie performed well at the box office   The film s depth charge sequences  which produce rumbling bass tones below 25 Hz  are widely cited as a way of testing subwoofers in a home theater set up   4  Controversies regarding content  4 1  Historical events  The film s depiction of American heroics in capturing an Enigma machine angered Britons  The Allies captured Enigma related codebooks and machines about 15 times during World War II  All but two of these actions were by British forces  The Royal Canadian Navy captured U 774 and the U S  Navy seized in June 1944  By this time the Allies were already routinely decoding German naval Enigma traffic   While the United States  direct participation in World War II commenced in mid 1941 with Lend Lease  tactical involvement did not commence until after the Attack on Pearl Harbor  by which time the history of capturing Enigma machines and breaking their codes had already begun in Europe   An earlier military Enigma machine had been captured by Polish Intelligence in 1928  the Polish Cipher Bureau broke the Enigma code in 1932 and gave their findings to Britain and France in 1939  just before the German invasion of Poland   The first capture of a naval Enigma machine and associated cipher keys from a U boat were made on May 9  1941 by of Britain s Royal Navy  commanded by Captain Joe Baker Cresswell  The U boat was   In 1942  the British seized   capturing additional Enigma codebooks  According to Britain s Channel 4   The captured codebooks provided vital assistance to the British cryptographers  led by Alan Turing  at the code breaking hothouse of Bletchley Park  near Milton Keynes    The capture  rather than sinking  of – the only ship to be captured by an aircraft – on August 27  1941 by a Lockheed Hudson from RAF Coastal Command was important for determining the fighting capacity of U boats  although her crew destroyed the Enigma and cipher information  The boat was towed to port and commissioned into the Royal Navy as    During Prime Minister s Questions  Tony Blair agreed with questioner Brian Jenkins MP that the film was  an affront  to British sailors  In response to a letter from Paul Truswell  MP for the Pudsey constituency  which includes Horsforth  a town proud of its connection with HMS Aubretia   U S  president Bill Clinton wrote assuring that the film s plot was only a work of fiction   David Balme  the British naval officer who led the boarding party aboard U 110  called U 571   a great film  and said that the film would not have been financially viable without being  Americanized   The film s producers did not agree to his request for a statement that the film was a work of fiction  but the end credits dedicate the film to the  Allied sailors and officers who risked their lives capturing Enigma materials  during World War II  The credits acknowledge the Royal Navy s role in capturing Enigma machines and code documents from U 110  U 559  and the U S  Navy s capture of U 505   In 2006  screenwriter David Ayer admitted that U 571 distorted history and stated that he would not do it again  Ayer told BBC Radio 4 s The Film Programme that he  did not feel good  about suggesting Americans  rather than the British  captured the naval Enigma cipher   4 2  Negative portrayal of U boat sailors  The film portrays a scene in which the U boat sailors kill the Allied merchant crewmen who have survived their ship s sinking  in compliance with naval policy and so that the survivors do not report the U boat position  German U boat crews were under War Order No  154 not to rescue survivors  which paralleled Allied policy  Of all the several thousand sinkings of merchant ships in World War II  there is only one case of a U boat crew s deliberately attacking the survivors of a sinking  that of the   whose crew attacked survivors of the Greek ship Peleus   4 3  General inaccuracies  Although the US submariners crewing U 571 successfully sink the German resupply U boat in an undersea battle  in reality this was extremely difficult for any World War II submarine to achieve  The only instance of a submerged submarine s sinking another submerged vessel was the Action of 9 February 1945  when sank the with torpedoes   The presence of the German destroyer in the Atlantic Ocean is a likely inaccuracy  as most of the surface fleet of the Kriegsmarine never ventured far west into the Atlantic  owing to the overwhelming strength of the British  Canadian and US surface fleets   and no German ship did so from 1942 onwards  The few exceptions were their capital ships  such as   and    Additionally  German Type XIV supply U boats did not possess torpedo tubes and thus  if historically accurate  could not have attacked S 33   In the discussion of the plan to capture the Enigma  Maj  Coonan addresses Lt  Tyler as  sir   As a major in the Marines  he outranked Tyler  A major in the Marines  Army or Air Force is the equivalent of a lieutenant commander in the Navy  which outranks a lieutenant  He might  however  have addressed him as  sir  because he was the submarine s executive officer  Also  an executive officer normally holds a rank higher than lieutenant unless the Captain is a Lieutenant commander  However  in the military rank structure  position usually takes precedence over rank   During the destroyer s depth charge attack more than 80 depth charges are detonated in the film  despite the fact that German destroyers rarely carried more than 30 depth charges during the war   The Messerschmitt 109 that buzzes the submarine prior to her encounter with the destroyer is referred to as a  long range reconnaissance  aircraft  In reality  the 109 was a relatively short range aircraft not typically deployed on such duties   The real   captained by Oberleutnant zur See Gustav Lüssow  was lost with all hands on January 28  1944  west of Ireland  She was hit by depth charges  dropped from a Short Sunderland Mk III flying boat  EK577  callsign  D for Dog   belonging to No  461 Squadron  Royal Australian Air Force  RAAF   The aircraft s commander  Flt Lt Richard Lucas  reported that most of the U boat s 52 crew managed to abandon ship  but all died from hypothermia   D for Dog   which was crewed partly by Royal Air Force  RAF  personnel  was based at RAF Pembroke Dock in Wales   The real was stationed in the Pacific Ocean from June 1942 till the end of the war  She was not sunk during World War II and was sold for scrap in 1946  The did not sink in a test dive  she instead sank in a collision with a patrol combatant    in January 1942   The Thompson submachine gun used by the sailors in the US boarding party had M1A1 Carbine folding stocks  There is no historical evidence that any such variant existed in this time period  or indeed at all   5  Deleted scenes  The film was originally  in the USA  rated  R  due to a scene where Lt  Pete Emmett  Jon Bon Jovi  is decapitated by flying debris  To get a  PG 13   the shot was redone with Emmett this time knocked overboard by flying debris  This left many audience members not knowing what happened to his character  A death scene was also filmed for Maj  Matthew Coonan  David Keith   but the effect did not work well so it was cut from the film   6  Awards and nominations  The film was nominated for two awards at the 73rd Academy Awards  Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing  Steve Maslow  Gregg Landaker  Rick Kline and Ivan Sharrock   It won the sound editing award   7  See also  Das Boot  Submarine films  History of cryptology — World War II cryptology  Biuro Szyfrów  Polish
