The Paleozoic  or Palaeozoic  Era   or   from the Greek palaios  παλαιός    old  and zoe  ζωή    life   meaning  ancient life   is the earliest of three geologic eras of the Phanerozoic Eon  spanning from roughly  ICS  2004   It is the longest of the Phanerozoic eras  and is subdivided into six geologic periods  from oldest to youngest   the Cambrian  Ordovician  Silurian  Devonian  Carboniferous  and Permian  The Paleozoic comes after the Neoproterozoic Era of the Proterozoic Eon  and is followed by the Mesozoic Era   The Paleozoic was a time of dramatic geological  climatic  and evolutionary change  The Cambrian Period witnessed the most rapid and widespread diversification of life in Earth s history  known as the Cambrian explosion  in which most modern phyla first appeared  Fish  arthropods  amphibians and reptiles all evolved during the Paleozoic  Life began in the ocean but eventually transitioned onto land  and by the late Paleozoic  it was dominated by various forms of organisms  Great forests of primitive plants covered the continents  many of which formed the coal beds of Europe and eastern North America  Towards the end of the era  large  sophisticated reptiles were dominant and the first modern plants  conifers  appeared   The Paleozoic Era ended with the largest mass extinction in Earth s history  the Permian–Triassic extinction event  The effects of this catastrophe were so devastating that it took life on land 30 million years into the Mesozoic to recover  Recovery of life in the sea may have been much faster   1  Geology  In North America  the era began with deep sedimentary basins along the eastern  southeastern  and western sides of the continent  while the interior was dry land  As the era proceeded  the marginal seas periodically washed over the stable interior  leaving sedimentary deposits to mark their incursions  During the early part of the era  the area of exposed Precambrian  or shield  rocks in central Canada were eroding  supplying sediment to the basins from the interior  Beginning in the Ordovician Period  mountain building intermittently proceeded in the eastern part of the Appalachian region throughout the rest of the era  bringing in new sediments  Sediments washing from the Acadian Mountains filled the western part of the Appalachian basins to form the famous coal swamps of the Carboniferous Period  In North America  carboniferous is not generally used  Instead  the time is divided between Mississippian and Pennsylvanian periods because of differences in the sedimentary rock deposited during that time  The Mississippian is characterized by limey sediments deposited in shallow seas  typically with abundant crinoidal fossils as in the Burlington Formation  The Pennsylvanian typically is characterized by terrestrial sediments such as sands  shale and most importantly coal  Most of our oil and gas are obtained from Pennsylvanian sediments  Where this has been stripped  as in the Ozark domal region  oil is not typically available   Paleoclimatic studies and evidence of glaciers indicate that central Africa was most likely in the polar regions during the early Paleozoic  During the early Paleozoic  the huge continent Gondwanaland had either formed or was forming  By mid Paleozoic  the collision of North America and Europe produced the Acadian Caledonian uplifts  and a subduction plate uplifted eastern Australia  By the late Paleozoic  continental collisions formed the supercontinent Pangaea and resulted in some of the great mountain chains  including the Appalachians  Urals  and mountains of Tasmania   1 1  Tectonic activity  Geologically  the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Pannotia  Throughout the early Paleozoic  the Earth s landmass was broken up into a substantial number of continents  Towards the end of the era  the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea  which included most of the Earth s land area   2  Climate  The Ordovician and Silurian periods were warm greenhouse periods  with the highest sea levels of the Paleozoic  200 m above today s   the warm climate was interrupted only by a cool period  the Early Palaeozoic Icehouse  culminating in the Hirnantian glaciation   The early Cambrian climate was probably moderate at first  becoming warmer over the course of the Cambrian  as the second greatest sustained sea level rise in the Phanerozoic got underway  However  as if to offset this trend  Gondwana moved south with considerable speed  so that  in Ordovician time  most of West Gondwana  Africa and South America  lay directly over the South Pole  The early Paleozoic climate was also strongly zonal  with the result that the  climate   in an abstract sense became warmer  but the living space of most organisms of the time—the continental shelf marine environment—became steadily colder  However  Baltica  Northern Europe and Russia  and Laurentia  eastern North America and Greenland  remained in the tropical zone  while China and Australia lay in waters which were at least temperate  The Early Paleozoic ended  rather abruptly  with the short  but apparently severe  late Ordovician ice age  This cold spell caused the second greatest mass extinction of Phanerozoic time  Over time  the warmer weather moved into the Paleozoic Era   The middle Paleozoic was a time of considerable stability  Sea levels had dropped coincident with the ice age  but slowly recovered over the course of the Silurian and Devonian  The slow merger of Baltica and Laurentia  and the northward movement of bits and pieces of Gondwana created numerous new regions of relatively warm  shallow sea floor  As plants took hold on the continental margins  oxygen levels increased and carbon dioxide dropped  although much less dramatically  The north–south temperature gradient also seems to have moderated  or metazoan life simply became hardier  or both  At any event  the far southern continental margins of Antarctica and West Gondwana became increasingly less barren  The Devonian ended with a series of turnover pulses which killed off much of Middle Paleozoic vertebrate life  without noticeably reducing species diversity overall   The late Paleozoic was a time which has left us a good many unanswered questions  The Mississippian began with a spike in atmospheric oxygen  while carbon dioxide plummeted to unheard of lows  This destabilized the climate and led to one  and perhaps two  ice ages during the Carboniferous  These were far more severe than the brief Late Ordovician Ice  but  this time  the effects on world biota were inconsequential  By the Cisuralian  both oxygen and carbon dioxide had recovered to more normal levels  On the other hand  the assembly of Pangaea created huge arid inland areas subject to temperature extremes  The Lopingian is associated with falling sea levels  increased carbon dioxide and general climatic deterioration  culminating in the devastation of the Permian extinction   3  Flora  While macroscopic plant life appeared early in the Paleozoic and possibly late in the Neoproterozoic  it mostly remained aquatic until sometime in the Silurian and Devonian  when it began to transition onto dry land  Terrestrial flora reached its climax in the Carboniferous  when towering lycopsid rainforests dominated the tropical belt of Euramerica  Climate change caused the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse which fragmented this habitat  diminishing the diversity of plant life in the late Carboniferous and Permian   4  Fauna  A noteworthy feature of Paleozoic life is the sudden appearance of nearly all of the invertebrate animal phyla in great abundance at the beginning of the Cambrian  The first vertebrates appeared in the form of primitive fish  which greatly diversified in the Silurian and Devonian  The first animals to venture onto dry land were the arthropods  Some fish had lungs  and powerful bony fins that also could crawl onto land  The bones in their fins eventually evolved into legs and they became the first tetrapods  Amphibians were the dominant tetrapods until the mid Carboniferous  when climate change greatly reduced their diversity  Later  reptiles prospered and continued to increase in number and variety by the late Permian   5  See also  Geologic timescale  Precambrian  Cenozoic  Mesozoic  6  References and further
