Maniac Mansion is a 1987 graphic adventure game developed and published by Lucasfilm Games  Initially released for the Commodore&nbsp 64 and Apple&nbsp II  it was Lucasfilm s foray into video game publishing  The game follows teenager Dave Miller as he ventures into a mansion and attempts to rescue his girlfriend from an evil mad scientist  whose family has been controlled by a sentient meteor that crashed near the mansion 20 years earlier  The player uses a point and click interface to guide Dave and two of his friends through the mansion while avoiding its dangerous inhabitants and solving puzzles   The game was conceived in 1985 by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick  They based the story on horror film and B movie clichés with humorous elements  and they based the game s characters on people they knew and characters from movies  comics  and horror magazines  The developers based the mansion s design on the Main House at Skywalker Ranch  outlining the map and pathways prior to programming  The interface came from the designers  desire to improve on contemporary text parser based graphical adventure games seen in earlier adventure titles  To reduce the effort required for creating the game  Gilbert implemented a game engine called SCUMM  which would be re used for many other LucasArts titles  The game was ported to several other platforms  the Nintendo Entertainment System  NES  version had to be considerably modified to follow Nintendo of America s content policies  which barred material deemed inappropriate for children   Regarded as a seminal adventure title  Maniac Mansion was critically acclaimed  reviewers lauded its graphics  cutscenes  animation  and humor  Reviewers and other developers have considered its point and click interface revolutionary  the system has led competitors to adopt similar interfaces  The game influenced numerous other titles  has been placed in several  hall of fame  lists  and has led fans to create remakes with enhanced visuals  A TV series  written by Eugene Levy and starring Joe Flaherty  was created in 1990 and lasted for three seasons  filming 66 episodes  Lucasfilm Games released the sequel Day of the Tentacle in 1993  which also received critical acclaim   1  Overview  Maniac Mansion takes place in the mansion of the Edison family  Dr  Fred  Nurse Edna  and their son Weird Ed  Living with the Edisons are two large  disembodied tentacles – one purple and the other green  The intro sequence shows that a meteor crashed near the mansion twenty years earlier  The sentient meteor took control of the family and caused Dr  Fred to start sucking out human brains for use in experiments  his family supported and encouraged him in these efforts  One day  main protagonist Dave Miller s girlfriend  cheerleader Sandy Pantz  disappears without a trace  and he suspects that Dr  Fred has kidnapped her  After the game s introduction  Dave and his two companions prepare to enter the mansion to rescue Sandy  the game starts with a prompt for the player to select two of six characters to accompany Dave   Maniac Mansion is a graphic adventure game in which the player uses a point and click interface to guide characters through a two dimensional  2D  game world and to solve puzzles  Players can select from fifteen different commands with this scheme  examples include  walk to   to move the characters   new kid   to switch between the three characters  and  pick up   to collect objects  Each character possesses unique abilities  for example  Syd and Razor can play musical instruments  while Bernard can repair appliances  The game may be completed with any character combination  but because many puzzles can be solved only with specific skills  the game can be finished in different ways  depending on the characters the player has chosen   The gameplay is regularly interrupted by cutscenes  a term Ron Gilbert coined  that advance the story and inform the player about non player characters  actions  Aside from the green tentacle  the mansion s inhabitants pose a threat and will throw the player characters into the dungeon—or in some situations kill them—if they see them  If one character dies  the player must choose a replacement from the unselected characters  the game ends if all the characters die  Maniac Mansion has five possible successful endings that depend on which characters the player uses  which ones survive  and what events occur   2  Development  2 1  Conception  Maniac Mansion was first conceived in 1985  when Lucasfilm Games assigned employees Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick the task of creating an original game  Noah Falstein had recently hired Gilbert at Lucasfilm Games on a three month contract to program the game Koronis Rift  At the same time  Winnick was working on Labyrinth  The Computer Game  and it was then in which both Gilbert and Winnick found that they shared similar tastes in humor  movies  and television programs  Eventually  Gilbert was hired full time  As with earlier Lucasfilm titles  the company s management provided little oversight in the development process  which Gilbert credited the success of many of its earlier games   Gilbert and Winnick were co writers and lead designers of Maniac Mansion  but they worked separately  Gilbert on programming and Winnick on the art   Together  they brainstormed story ideas and  based on their love of B horror films  decided to create a comedy–horror title set in a haunted house  They drew inspiration from what Winnick called  a ridiculous teen horror movie   which the teens were in a house and were slaughtered one by one and not once thinking about leaving  The pair compared this film to clichés in other popular horror films such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street  and used them to come up with the game s setting  Early development involved experimentation and was organic  according to Gilbert   Very little was written down  Gary and I just talked and laughed a lot  and out it came   After development had begun  Lucasfilm Games relocated its office to the Stable House at Skywalker Ranch  The ranch s Main House inspired Winnick s design of the game s mansion and him to create the game s concept art  He recreated several rooms in the Main House for the game  such as a library with a spiral staircase and a media room with a large screen TV and grand piano  The various rooms at the ranch inspired the design of other rooms in the mansion   The pair prioritized the story and characters  and wanted to maintain a balance between a  sense of peril and sense of humor   The first character concepts were a set of siblings and their friends  which gradually evolved into the final characters  Gilbert and Winnick based the characters on stereotypes and people they knew  For example  Winnick s girlfriend Ray inspired Razor  and while Gilbert s mother apparently served as the basis for Nurse Edna – Gilbert has denied the connection  Dave and Wendy were based on Gilbert and a fellow employee named Wendy  respectively  According to Winnick  the Edison family were based on various movie characters and elements from EC Comics and Warren Publishing magazines  They sought to give each playable character unique abilities  However  they had to exclude several characters due to size limitations  To parody the horror genre  the developers inserted many film clichés into the story  For instance  the sentient meteor that takes control of Dr  Fred was inspired from a segment of the 1982 anthology film Creepshow titled  The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill   The designers also included a man eating plant similar to the villain of the 1986 film Little Shop of Horrors   The pair struggled to choose a gameplay genre  Gilbert described their early ideas as  disconnected   While visiting relatives for Christmas  Gilbert saw his cousin playing King s Quest  Quest for the Crown  Gilbert was an adventure games fan and decided that the ideas he and Winnick had conceived would work well with the genre  His first exposure to a text adventure with graphics  Gilbert spent the holiday playing the game to familiarize himself with the format   Gilbert and Winnick created Maniac Mansions basic structure and story prior to programming  its earliest version was a simple paper and pencil board game  which the mansion s floor plan served as the game board  and cards represented events and characters  Lines connected the rooms to illustrate pathways characters could travel  The designers used layers of cellulose acetate to map out the game s puzzles by tracking which items worked together when used by certain characters  Impressed with the map s complexity  Winnick included it in the game as a poster in one of the mansion s rooms  Because each character contributed different skills and resources  the pair spent months working on the event combinations that could occur  This extended the game s production time beyond that of Lucasfilm Games  previous titles  which almost led to Gilbert s firing  Though they had outlined the game s events  the dialogue was not written until after programming had started  David Fox provided the dialog  Alternate endings were uncommon at the time  and Maniac Mansion was one of the first games to feature them   2 2  Commodore 64 limitations  Development focused on the Commodore&nbsp 64 home computer  so a concern was to make the game small enough to fit into its 64 KB memory  Scrolling was used to show objects and characters in rooms during cutscenes  The designers used this technique to force players to explore the mansion s larger rooms by hiding elements off screen  However  the Commodore s bitmap mode was unsuitable because it needed a large amount of memory  8k  and did not permit scrolling  only character screens can be scrolled on the VIC II chip   Thus the game had to use character graphics which were scrollable and only took 1k  but couldn t have the same level of graphical detail as bitmaps  The set uses 8 × 8 pixel tiles  Since the VIC II could only have 256 tiles  two 128 character sets which may be switched   it limited the level of detail Winnick could design into the graphics  To circumvent this  Gilbert created a program to generate the tiles from Winnick s pixel art  To comply with the tile limit  the program compared similar tiles and created approximations that could replace multiple tiles  Winnick inspected the results for visual errors and then repeated the process until the number of tiles was sufficiently reduced  To make the characters easily recognizable  Winnick made the heads relatively large  Each character consisted of three multicolor sprites stacked on each other  Because the Commodore 64 restricted sprites to 24 pixels horizontally  the characters  animations never extend outside this width   2 3  SCUMM  game engine and scripting language  Gilbert started programming the game in assembly language for the 6502 microprocessor which was the norm for Commodore&nbsp 64 games  However  he quickly realized that the game was too large and complex to easily be written in assembly and that a high level scripting engine similar to Sierra s AGI system would have to be developed  Gilbert initially considered basing the language on LISP but ultimately chose a syntax that more closely resembles that of the C programming language  He discussed the problem with fellow Lucasfilm employee Chip Morningstar  who helped him build a foundation for the game engine  which Gilbert then extended  In designing the engine and language  Gilbert developed a  system that could be used on many adventure games  cutting down the time it took to make them   He logged considerable overtime with the goal of creating an adventure game superior to those of Lucasfilm s competitors  Gilbert designed the engine to allow for multitasking  allowing designers to isolate and manipulate specific game objects independently  Most of the first six to nine months of Maniac Mansions development involved building the engine   A primary development goal was to create a control system that not only retained the structure of classic text adventures  but also dispensed with the typing  The two lead designers were frustrated with the text parsers and the inevitable player character deaths that were prominent in the genre  While in college  Gilbert had enjoyed Colossal Cave Adventure and Infocom s games but had  really wanted to see graphics   He felt that the visual element Sierra Entertainment added for its games was  a big improvement   but he disliked the games  use of text parsers  While playing King s Quest  Gilbert found guessing what terms the designer had programmed it to recognize aggravating because he could see the object he wanted to interact with on the screen  but he had to figure out the correct commands  Gilbert reasoned that if he could view the graphic  then he should be able to click on it with a cursor  by extension  the player should also be able to click on verb commands  Gilbert devised a new and simpler interface  because I m lazy and don t like to type  I hated playing adventure games where I had to type everything in  and I hated playing the  second guess the parser  game so I figure everything should be point and click    The team originally envisioned 40 verb commands  but it whittled the number down to the 12 it felt were essential  The commands were then integrated into the scripting language in a similar fashion Sierra did with its Adventure Game Interpreter and Sierra s Creative Interpreter  Gilbert believed that a complex game did not need a text parser  but rather an innovative use of the interactions between in game objects  He showed the team a demonstration of Sierra games and then led a discussion about their user interface and gameplay issues  Gilbert finished the engine – which he later named  Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion   SCUMM  – after around a year of development  It freed the developers from having to code the details in low level language  Though the game had been designed with the Commodore 64 in mind  the SCUMM engine enabled easy porting of Maniac Mansion to other platforms  Lucasfilm developers Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor would assist in the PC port of the script   2 4  Scripting and testing  At Gilbert s request  David Fox  who had previously worked on Labyrinth  The Computer Game  assisted with Maniac Mansions scripting  Fox was between projects and planned to do a month s work on the game  however  he stayed on the project for roughly six months  He discussed the game s events with Gilbert and Winnick  and used that information to create the rooms with the script  The developers added designated areas or  walk boxes  that characters could traverse in the game world  Gilbert and Fox wrote the characters  dialog and choreographed the action  Fox expanded the game based on ideas he conceived while viewing Winnick s concept art  such as allowing players to place a hamster in the kitchen microwave   Gilbert wanted players to enjoy Maniac Mansion and not be punished for applying real world logic  In the Sierra game Space Quest&nbsp II  the player can get killed by merely picking up broken glass and bleed to death with no prior warning  Fox asserted that  I know that in the real world I can successfully pick up a broken piece of mirror without dying  and characterized such game design as  sadistic   The team wanted to avoid illogical  surprise deaths  to spare players from having to regularly reload the game from a previous save state  As a result  the group created a number of possibilities to give the player more freedom  While there are several ways players can get the characters killed in Maniac Mansion  they re almost impossible to do except intentionally  While scripting the game  however  the designers realized that the number of characters resulted in a very complex game with a number of flaws  particularly dead ends that prevented the player from completing the game  To address these issues  they often revised the puzzles  In retrospect  Gilbert acknowledged that the fact that Lucasfilm Games had only one tester allowed many errors to go undetected  Gilbert s uncle also helped as an outside play tester  Each week  Gilbert would mail him a floppy disk of the game s latest build   The PC  Amiga  and Atari ST versions of the game came with a booklet called Nuke m Alarms – named after the security system that protects the mansion – that served as copy protection for the corresponding piece of software  The booklet contained a list of codes that had to be entered to disarm the mansion s nuclear security device and open the door at the top of the foyer  The codes  which were Commodore graphics characters  were printed on a special paper so that they could not be easily photocopied  players had to use a special cellophane lens to read the codes  They were given three opportunities to enter the codes correctly  after which the mansion would explode  ending the game  Moreover  if the player tries to use Bernard to disarm the security device  the mansion automatically explodes  Although the designers had intended for the copy protection codes to be in the original Commodore and Apple versions  they had to be left out because of insufficient disk space and instead an on disk protection was used  When the game was ported to the NES  the copy protection device and script was inadvertently left in the game  hidden behind a statue  According to developer David Warhol  players could interact with the now invisible device and subsequently cause a  game over    3  Release  In contrast to its previous games  where Lucasfilm Games had been only the developer and had used external publishers  the company started taking on the role of publisher with Maniac Mansion  Lucasfilm Games hired Ken Macklin  whom Winnick knew  to design the packaging s artwork  Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design the back cover  The two also created an insert that includes hints  a backstory  and jokes   After around 18 to 24 months of development  the game debuted at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago  The game was initially released for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in October 1987  After a Toys  R  Us customer complained about the word  lust  on the back cover  the store pulled the game from its shelves until Lucasfilm Games altered the box  In March 1988  the PC port was released which used slightly more detailed title screen graphics  Ports for the Amiga  Atari ST  and NES followed   3 1  Nintendo Entertainment System version  Published by Jaleco in September 1990  Maniac Mansion was Lucasfilm Games  first NES release  The developer was unable to properly focus on the project owing to a large workload  therefore  Douglas Crockford volunteered to manage it  The studio used a modified version of the SCUMM engine titled  NES SCUMM  for the port  Crockford noted that  one of the main differences between the NES and PCs is that the NES can do certain things much faster   Developer Tim Schafer  who would go on to develop other Lucasfilm games such as Maniac Mansions sequel Day of the Tentacle  play tested the port  this was Schafer s first professional credit  The studio had to completely redraw the game s graphics to conform with the NES s display resolution requirements   During its initial development for home computers  Lucasfilm Games censored profanity in the game  for instance  the company forced the developers to change Dave Miller s opening line of  Don t be a shit head  to  Don t be a tuna head   However  for the NES version  the designers had to remove further content so that it was suitable for younger audiences and according to Nintendo s policies  Jaleco USA president Howie Rubin advised Crockford about what content Nintendo might object  such as any usage of the word  kill  in the game  However  Crockford s interpretation of the NES Game Standards Policy led him to believe that other elements might also conflict with it  so he sent a list of questionable content to Jaleco  Its staff believed that the content was reasonable  and Lucasfilm Games submitted Maniac Mansion to Nintendo   A month after submitting the game  Nintendo of America sent Lucasfilm Games a report that outlined offensive on screen text and nude graphics that it wanted removed  Crockford further modified the content to comply  while trying to maintain the game s essential aspects  For example  Nintendo wanted the developers to remove graffiti in a room that provided players with hints on how to activate a story event  unable to remove it without also removing the hints  the designers shortened the message  Nintendo listed objectionable dialog lines that needed to be changed  including many of Nurse Edna s sexually suggestive lines  They also removed the line from one of Dr  Fred s cutscene in which he said  getting your pretty brains sucked out   not saying right away what part of the line was offensive  they clarified  saying that  sucked  was deemed too graphic  Crockford changed the word to  removed  and also removed a poster that said  disco sucks  from the green tentacle s bedroom to be consistent with their wishes  The nudity Nintendo outlined encompassed a poster of a mummy in a playmate pose  a swimsuit calendar  and a classical statue of reclining woman  The studio removed the poster and calendar  but they fought to keep the statue  claiming that it was modeled after a Michelangelo sculpture  The censors suggested an alteration  but Lucasfilm Games ultimately removed the object  Nintendo of America also objected to the phrase  NES SCUMM  in the end credits  which Crockford removed but not without questioning why the censors had overlooked the more offensive content  In retrospect  Crockford felt that such standards resulted in  bland  products and called Nintendo a  jealous god    After implementing the changes  Lucasfilm Games re submitted Maniac Mansion to Nintendo  which then manufactured 250 000 cartridges  The NES cartridge features a battery back up to save data  and a prototype NES cartridge with the original content is rumored to exist  In early 1990  Nintendo announced the port in its official magazine and provided further coverage later in the year  The ability to microwave a hamster remained in the game  which Crockford cited as an example of the censors  confusing criteria  However  Nintendo later noticed it and demanded its removal  Originally  there was only one printing of the NTSC version of the game  meaning that only PAL region copies were affected  A second run of the game for NTSC regions then removed this content  After the first batch of cartridges was sold  Nintendo made Jaleco remove the content in future releases  The Japanese release omitted some graphical and musical elements  featured flip screen scrolling  and had alterations to the characters  appearances  Maniac Mansion was one of four games in the NES library – along with Shadowgate  F 15 Strike Eagle  and Déjà Vu – to be translated into Swedish   The port s music was handled by Realtime Associates  Late in development  Jaleco asked the company to provide background music  noting that port lacked it and despite the lack of background music in all previous ports  Realtime Associates  founder and president David Warhol noted that  video games at that time had to have  wall to wall  music   Warhol went to George  The Fat Man  Sanger and his band Team Fat  and David Hayes to write the background music  while Warhol worked on translating them to NES chiptune music  The musicians composed music to best suit the characters  such as a punk rock theme for Razor  an electronic rock theme for Bernard  a surfer based theme for Jeff  and a Hayes inspired version of Thin Lizzy s  The Boys Are Back in Town  for the main protagonist Dave   4  Reception  Maniac Mansion was well received by critics  and several reviewers likened the game to films  Commodore Users Bill Scolding and Zzap 64s three reviewers – Paul Summer  Julian Rignall  and Steve Jarratt – compared it to The Rocky Horror Picture Show  Other comparisons were drawn to Psycho  Friday the 13th  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre  The Addams Family  and Scooby Doo  Compute  s Gazettes Keith Farrell cited Maniac Mansions similarity to films  particularly with its use of cutscenes to add  information or urgency   He lauded the game s high level of detail along with its graphics and animation  writing   Each of the teenagers is fully realized  with features and wardrobe that are wholly in character   In later issues  editor Orson Scott Card praised the game s humor  cinematic storytelling  and lack of violence  He called it  a compellingly good game  and evidence that Lucasfilm was helping  to make computer games a valid storytelling art   and Shay Addams wrote in the magazine that  the interface  graphics  and warped comedy make Maniac Mansion a must explore for fans of both horror and humor   Commodore Magazines Russ Ceccola praised its cutscenes as creative and high quality  He called the ending  unforgettable  and praised the game s audio visuals  Ceccola noted that the  characters are distinctively Lucasfilm s  bringing facial expressions and personality to each individual character   He ended by recommending readers to buy Maniac Mansion  as it would please fans of the genre   Zzap 64s reviewers praised the game s humor and called its point and click control  tremendous   they concluded by describing the game as  innovative and polished   ACE magazine s reviewer enjoyed the game s animation  multi character gameplay  and depth  and called it  one of the better pics n  action games on the market   The reviewer enjoyed the game but commented that  traditional adventurers  wouldn t as much  Scolding noted Maniac Mansions  flash graphics and black humour  and finished by calling the game one of the best of its kind  German magazine Happy Computer compared the cinematic cutscene usage to earlier Lucasfilm titles Koronis Rift and Labyrinth  The Computer Game  and the menu system to ICOM Simulations  Uninvited  The reviewers lauded the game s user friendly menu system  graphics  originality  and overall enjoyability  one of the reviewers called it the best adventure title at the time  The magazine later reported that it was West Germany s highest selling video game for three straight months   In more recent reviews  Eurogamers Kristan Reed praised the game s  ambitious  design  citing the cast of characters   elegant  interface  and writing  Game designer Sheri Graner Ray listed Maniac Mansion as an example of a game that challenged the  damsel in distress  concept by including female protagonists  However  writer Mark Dery commented that rescuing the kidnapped cheerleader reinforced negative gender roles  In choosing the top ten all time games for the Commodore 64  Retro Gamer stated that Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken were equally good  but it selected the latter because of Maniac Mansions prominence  In another issue  editor Ashley Day listed the game as having his favorite ending – the mansion s explosion upon pressing an unexpected button  In 2009  IGN staff named Maniac Mansion one of the ten best LucasArts adventure games  Richard Cobbett of PC Gamer called it  one of the most intricate and important adventure games ever made   citing the SCUMM interface and its establishment of a legacy for Lucasfilm Games during this time   4 1  Reception of ports  Maniac Mansion was also well received in multi format reviews  including the Commodore 64  Apple II  and PC versions  In noting the game s parodic nature  Questbusters  The Adventurer s Newsletter editor Shay Addams wrote that the SCUMM system worked better than the wheel used in Labyrinth  The Computer Game  calling it an improvement from Interplay s title Tass Times in Tonetown  He concluded by writing that Maniac Mansion was Lucasfilm s best title released and that it is a good buy for Commodore 64 and Apple II users who were unable to play games with better visuals such as from Sierra Entertainment  Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai praised the game s pacing  cutscenes  and humor  stating that it  strikes the necessary and precarious balance between laughs and suspense that so many comic horror films and novels lack   Despite faulting its small number of commands  he hailed its control system as  one of the most comfortable ever devised   However  Ardai disliked the game s small quantity of sound effects and music  Ardai finished by calling it  a clever and imaginative game       and  a successful stylistic experiment    In other multi format reviews  The Deseret News staff called it  wonderful fun  and noted that the  art and animation are gorgeous   The writers considered the game s audio  the best  they had  heard   Reviewing the PC and Atari ST ports  a critic from The Games Machine called Maniac Mansion  an enjoyable romp  with a structure superior to subsequent LucasArts adventure games  However  the magazine writer noted the game s poor pathfinding and stated that  the lack of sound effects reduces atmosphere   Of the two versions  the reviewer believed that the Atari ST audiovisuals were better  Comparing the PC version to Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  The Graphic Adventure  reviewers from French magazine Génération 4 praised the game s story  interface  and humor  stating that it was  beautifully done   however  one reviewer commented that the developers ripped the graphics from Indiana Jones  Bill Kunkel and Joyce Worley of VideoGames & Computer Entertainment called Maniac Mansion  the most popular haunted house adventure  and  a genuine cult classic   while they found the plot and setup similar to most horror themed games  the pair praised the game s interface and execution   The game s Amiga version received a fair amount of praise  despite graphical shortcomings  In a 1993 review  The One Amigas Simon Byron noted that the game retained its  charm and humour  six years after its first release  However  he believed that Maniac Mansions art direction had become  tacky  compared to more recent games  Byron ended by writing that  if you fancy a cheap edge of the seat challenge then you couldn t really do much better   Amiga Format reviewer Stephen Bradly found the game derivative  but he noted that it featured  loads of visual humour   he added   Strangely  it s quite compelling after a while   Heinrich Lenhardt of German magazine Power Play wrote that the Amiga version  played like a poem  and just as well as the other ports  Michael Labiner of Amiga Joker  another German magazine  stated that it was one of the best adventure games released for the computer  While he wrote that there were minor graphical flaws  such as limited colors  Labiner stated that the gameplay made up for those shortcomings  Sweden based Datormagazins Ingela Palmér stated that the Amiga version differed little from the Commodore 64 one  and that those who already have the latter need not get the Amiga version  She added that  while the graphics and gameplay were not the best  Maniac Mansion remained highly enjoyable and easy  Palmér recommended that people new to the genre play this game first   Reviewers well received Maniac Mansions NES version  Based on the computer release s success  Game Players writers speculated that the NES port would be one of 1990 s better titles  UK based Mean Machines reviewers lauded the game for its presentation  playability  and replay value  while criticizing the blocky graphics and  ear bashing tunes   Reviewer Edward Laurence wrote that aside from minor graphical and sound improvements  little had changed from the Commodore 64 version  Julian Rignall compared the game to Shadowgate but noted differences between the two  he commented how Maniac Mansion had easy controls and that it lacked Shadowgates  death without warning situations   Despite his criticism of the audiovisuals  he wrote   Maniac Mansions excellent  thoroughly rewarding and genuinely funny gameplay more than makes up for its deficiencies  and the end result is a highly original and very addictive adventure that no Nintendo owner should be without   Video Games magazine reviewed the translated German version  and the reviewers labeled the game as a  Video Games Classic   Co reviewer Heinrich Lenhardt said that Maniac Mansion was unique and that no similar NES adventure game has since been released  He wrote that it was just as fun as the computer versions with good controls  but he noted that the graphics could be misleading at times  Co reviewer Winnie Forster wrote that the game was  one of the most original representatives of the  adventure game  genre  and that it was one of Lucasfilm s more successful games  In recent commentary  Edge magazine staff described the port as more conservative than the original version  calling it  somewhat neutered   GamesTM magazine writers referred to the NES version as  infamous  and heavily censored   Maniac Mansion was featured often in the magazine Nintendo Power  The game debuted on the magazine s Top 30 list at number 19 in February 1991  peaking at number 16 in August 1991  The magazine reviewed Maniac Mansion again in its February 1993 issue  as part of a staff overview on overlooked or otherwise undersold NES games  The editors felt that the popular RPG Final Fantasy overshadowed its September 1990 feature and drew more people to that game instead  Seven years after the game s release  the magazine ranked the NES version the 61st best game in its 100th issue in September 1997  calling Maniac Manion a  brilliant adventure   In its 20th anniversary issue  the magazine listed Maniac Mansion as the 16th best NES title  praising the game for its clever and funny writing and for being unlike any other game on the system  In its November 2010 issue  as part of the NES  25th anniversary  Chris Hoffman described the game as  unlike anything else out there – a point and click adventure with an awesome sense of humor and multiple solutions to almost every puzzle   Nintendo Power also commented on the ability to microwave a hamster  in its 25th anniversary retrospective  the staff stated that  it s hard to mention Maniac Mansion without it   Retro Gamer listed the hamster incident as one of the top 100 video game moments in March 2012   5  Impact and legacy  Referring to Maniac Mansion as a  seminal  title  GamesTM staff credited it with reinventing the graphical adventures  gameplay  The writer stated that removing the need to guess input verbs allowed players to focus more on the story and puzzles  resulting in less frustration and more enjoyment  Eurogamer s Kristan Reed made similar comments  saying that the design freed players from the  guessing game frustration  and made the process  infinitely more elegant and intuitive   However  Connie Veugen and Felipe Quérette noted that determining the game s vocabulary was an enjoyable aspect of the genre  GamesTM magazine further commented that the game had solidified Lucasfilm Games as a leader in the graphic adventure genre  Authors Mike and Sandie Morrison commented that the studio had brought  serious competition  to the genre in the form of Maniac Mansion  Authors Rusel DeMaria and Johnny Wilson echoed the sentiment  calling it a  landmark title  for the company  They also stated that the game  along with Space Quest and Leisure Suit Larry  had inaugurated a  new era of humor based adventure games   Reed seconded the statement  noting that the game  set in motion a captivating chapter in the history of gaming  that encompassed wit  invention  and style  GameSpy s Christopher Buecheler credited the game s success with making its genre commercially and critically viable  It was also one of the first video games to feature product placement  Pepsi brands   other games  such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II  The Arcade Game  Zool  and Tapper followed suit  Retro Gamers Stuart Hunt wrote in a September 2011 issue that  Maniac Mansion proved that videogames could capture the essence of an entirely different medium and opened our eyes to the wonderful things that happened when they placed their interactive stamp on them   The Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle developer Dave Grossman said that Maniac Mansion revolutionized the adventure game genre  also noting the fact that the game was only 64 KB large and that the music was good  especially for PCs  In a Joystiq interview on his development of The Cave  Gilbert said that some people originally did not classify Maniac Mansion as an adventure game because it was not a text based adventure with stationary graphics and a text parser  just as people did not classify The Cave as an adventure game because it is not point and click  He concluded by citing Maniac Mansion as an example of the evolution of the adventure game genre  saying   I think adventure games just evolve and they change  and I think you just need to do what s right for them    The game engine  SCUMM  has been described as  revolutionary   Throughout the following decade Lucasfilm Games used the engine to develop eleven other games  improving the engine with each subsequent game  GamesTM attributed this change to a desire to streamline production and produce fun games  Competitors eventually adopted similar systems for their adventure games  Following his departure from LucasArts  Lucasfilm Games had been combined under this name with ILM and Skywalker Sound in 1990  in 1992  Gilbert used the SCUMM technology to create adventure games and Backyard Sports games at Humongous Entertainment  The designers built on their experience from Maniac Mansion and expanded the process and their ambition in subsequent titles  In retrospect  Gilbert commented that he made a number of mistakes designing the game  for instance  the dead end situations that arise if certain items are used incorrectly  and applied the lessons to future games  In cutscenes  Gilbert had used a timer rather than a specific event to trigger them  which occasionally resulted in awkward scene changes  The designer aimed to avoid these flaws in the Monkey Island series of games  However  Gilbert commented that Maniac Mansion is his favorite because of its imperfections   5 1  In popular culture  Elements of Maniac Mansion have appeared elsewhere in popular culture  especially in other Lucasfilm games  An in game object called  Chuck the Plant  reappeared in other Lucas adventure titles like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Tales of Monkey Island  According to Gilbert  Steve Arnold  the LucasFilm general manager at the time  had a long running joke in which he continually requested game designers to add a character named Chuck to their game  Gilbert and Winnick were the first to humor Steve s request in Maniac Mansion  Because the developers were unable to fit an extra character name in the game  they named an existing in game plant  David Fox included a gasoline item for a nonexistent chainsaw in his game Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders as a parody of the chainsaw that required nonexistent gasoline in Maniac Mansion  Enthusiasts have created fan art depicting the characters  participated in cosplay based on the tentacle characters  and produced a trailer of a fictitious live action film   5 2  Fanmade Remakes  Various fanmade enhanced remakes of Maniac Mansion have appeared over the years   Maniac Mansion Deluxe  One German fan  Sascha Borisow  created a remake with enhanced audio and visuals  He used the freeware Adventure Game Studio to develop the game  and distributed it free on the internet  The remake had over 200 000 downloads by the end of 2004   Meteor Mess 3D  German developer Vampyr Games created a remake with 3D computer graphics which began as a learning tool for Gamestudio   Night of the Meteor  A group of German gamers  called Edison Interactive  is developing another remake which combines Maniac Mansions features with Day of the Tentacles visual design   Fans also created an episodic series of games based on Maniac Mansion   An uncensored unofficial NES version exists on Frank Cifaldi s website LostLevels org  Gilbert stated that he would like to see an official remake resemble the gameplay and graphics from Tales of Monkey Island  but he balked  citing George Lucas  enhanced remakes of the original Star Wars trilogy as a reason to keep the flaws in the original game   5 3  TV adaptation and game sequel  Lucasfilm had conceived the idea for a television adaptation  which The Family Channel purchased in 1990  A sitcom named after the game debuted in September 1990  It aired on YTV in Canada and The Family Channel in the United States  Partially based on the video game  the show focused on the Edison family s life and featured Joe Flaherty as Dr  Fred  Eugene Levy headed the writing staff  The program was a collaboration between Lucasfilm  The Family Channel  and Atlantis Films  In retrospect  Gilbert commented that the premise gradually changed during production to something that differed greatly from the game s original plot  Upon its debut  the show was well received by critics  Time magazine named it one of the best new shows of the year  However  other reviewers  such as Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker  questioned how the show made it on The Family Channel  given Flaherty s usage of SCTV like humor  PC Gamers Richard Cobbett  in a retrospective on the series  criticized its generic storylines and lack of relevance to the game  The series lasted for three seasons  filming 66 episodes   In the early 1990s  LucasArts asked Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer  who had both worked with Gilbert on the Monkey Island games  to design a sequel to Maniac Mansion  eventually titled Day of the Tentacle  Winnick and Gilbert initially assisted with the writing  Grossman and Schafer were able to include the voices and the improved visuals Gilbert had originally envisioned for Maniac Mansion  The game discarded the character selection and branching story lines in favor of a simpler format  and introduced time travel as the main puzzle element  The developers retained the Edison family and Bernard characters  but changed the art style to more closely resemble Chuck Jones  works  As a homage to Maniac Mansion  the designers included a puzzle that involves freezing a hamster  according to Grossman  he gave a happier outcome for the hamster as a response to Gilbert s grim ending for the hamster in Maniac Mansion  They also made the original game playable on an in game computer resembling a Commodore 64  which Grossman attributed to Gilbert reminiscing about the original s file size  LucasArts released Day of the Tentacle in 1993 to critical acclaim   6  References  7  External links  at C64Sets com
