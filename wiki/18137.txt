The logistic map is a polynomial mapping  equivalently  recurrence relation  of degree 2  often cited as an archetypal example of how complex  chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non linear dynamical equations  The map was popularized in a seminal 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May  in part as a discrete time demographic model analogous to the logistic equation first created by Pierre François Verhulst  Mathematically  the logistic map is written  where   This nonlinear difference equation is intended to capture two effects   reproduction where the population will increase at a rate proportional to the current population when the population size is small   starvation  density dependent mortality  where the growth rate will decrease at a rate proportional to the value obtained by taking the theoretical  carrying capacity  of the environment less the current population  However  as a demographic model the logistic map has the pathological problem that some initial conditions and parameter values lead to negative population sizes  This problem does not appear in the older Ricker model  which also exhibits chaotic dynamics   The case of the logistic map is a nonlinear transformation of both the bit shift map and the case of the tent map   1  Behavior dependent on r  The image below shows the amplitude and frequency content of some logistic map iterates for parameter values ranging from 2 to 4   By varying the parameter r  the following behavior is observed   With r between 0 and 1  the population will eventually die  independent of the initial population   With r between 1 and 2  the population will quickly approach the value   independent of the initial population   With r between 2 and 3  the population will also eventually approach the same value   but first will fluctuate around that value for some time  The rate of convergence is linear  except for r 3  when it is dramatically slow  less than linear   With r between 3 and  approximately 3 44949   from almost all initial conditions the population will approach permanent oscillations between two values  These two values are dependent on r   With r between 3 44949 and 3 54409  approximately   from almost all initial conditions the population will approach permanent oscillations among four values  The latter number is a root of a 12th degree polynomial    With r increasing beyond 3 54409  from almost all initial conditions the population will approach oscillations among 8 values  then 16  32  etc  The lengths of the parameter intervals that yield oscillations of a given length decrease rapidly  the ratio between the lengths of two successive such bifurcation intervals approaches the Feigenbaum constant δ   4 66920  This behavior is an example of a period doubling cascade   At r approximately 3 56995 is the onset of chaos  at the end of the period doubling cascade  From almost all initial conditions  we no longer see oscillations of finite period  Slight variations in the initial population yield dramatically different results over time  a prime characteristic of chaos   Most values beyond 3 56995 exhibit chaotic behaviour  but there are still certain isolated ranges of r that show non chaotic behavior  these are sometimes called islands of stability  For instance  beginning at  approximately 3 82843  there is a range of parameters r that show oscillation among three values  and for slightly higher values of r oscillation among 6 values  then 12 etc   The development of the chaotic behavior of the logistic sequence as the parameter r varies from approximately 3 56995 to approximately 3 82843 is sometimes called the Pomeau–Manneville scenario  characterized by a periodic  laminar  phase interrupted by bursts of aperiodic behavior  Such a scenario has an application in semiconductor devices  There are other ranges that yield oscillation among 5 values etc   all oscillation periods occur for some values of r  A period doubling window with parameter c is a range of r values consisting of a succession of sub ranges  The kth sub range contains the values of r for which there is a stable cycle  a cycle that attracts a set of initial points of unit measure  of period This sequence of sub ranges is called a cascade of harmonics  In a sub range with a stable cycle of period there are unstable cycles of period for all The r value at the end of the infinite sequence of sub ranges is called the point of accumulation of the cascade of harmonics  As r rises there is a succession of new windows with different c values  The first one is for c   1  all subsequent windows involving odd c occur in decreasing order of c starting with arbitrarily large c   Beyond r   4  the values eventually leave the interval  0 1  and diverge for almost all initial values  For any value of r there is at most one stable cycle  A stable cycle attracts almost all points  For an r with a stable cycle of some period  there can be infinitely many unstable cycles of various periods   A bifurcation diagram summarizes this  The horizontal axis shows the values of the parameter r while the vertical axis shows the possible long term values of x   The bifurcation diagram is a self similar  if you zoom in on the above mentioned value r   3 82843 and focus on one arm of the three  the situation nearby looks like a shrunk and slightly distorted version of the whole diagram  The same is true for all other non chaotic points  This is an example of the deep and ubiquitous connection between chaos and fractals   2  Chaos and the logistic map  The relative simplicity of the logistic map makes it an excellent point of entry into a consideration of the concept of chaos  A rough description of chaos is that chaotic systems exhibit a great sensitivity to initial conditions—a property of the logistic map for most values of r between about 3 57 and 4  as noted above   A common source of such sensitivity to initial conditions is that the map represents a repeated folding and stretching of the space on which it is defined  In the case of the logistic map  the quadratic difference equation  1  describing it may be thought of as a stretching and folding operation on the interval  0 1    The following figure illustrates the stretching and folding over a sequence of iterates of the map  Figure  a   left  gives a two dimensional phase diagram of the logistic map for r 4  and clearly shows the quadratic curve of the difference equation  1   However  we can embed the same sequence in a three dimensional phase space  in order to investigate the deeper structure of the map  Figure  b   right  demonstrates this  showing how initially nearby points begin to diverge  particularly in those regions of Xt corresponding to the steeper sections of the plot   This stretching and folding does not just produce a gradual divergence of the sequences of iterates  but an exponential divergence  see Lyapunov exponents   evidenced also by the complexity and unpredictability of the chaotic logistic map  In fact  exponential divergence of sequences of iterates explains the connection between chaos and unpredictability  a small error in the supposed initial state of the system will tend to correspond to a large error later in its evolution  Hence  predictions about future states become progressively  indeed  exponentially  worse when there are even very small errors in our knowledge of the initial state  This quality of unpredictability and apparent randomness led the logistic map equation to be used as a Pseudo random number generator in early computers   Since the map is confined to an interval on the real number line  its dimension is less than or equal to unity  Numerical estimates yield a correlation dimension of 0 500 ± 0 005  Grassberger  1983   a Hausdorff dimension of about 0 538  Grassberger 1981   and an information dimension of 0 5170976     Grassberger 1983  for r 3 5699456     onset of chaos   Note  It can be shown that the correlation dimension is certainly between 0 4926 and 0 5024   It is often possible  however  to make precise and accurate statements about the likelihood of a future state in a chaotic system  If a  possibly chaotic  dynamical system has an attractor  then there exists a probability measure that gives the long run proportion of time spent by the system in the various regions of the attractor  In the case of the logistic map with parameter  r   4  and an initial state in  0 1   the attractor is also the interval  0 1  and the probability measure corresponds to the beta distribution with parameters  a   0 5  and  b   0 5  Specifically  the invariant measure is   Unpredictability is not randomness  but in some circumstances looks very much like it  Hence  and fortunately  even if we know very little about the initial state of the logistic map  or some other chaotic system   we can still say something about the distribution of states a long time into the future  and use this knowledge to inform decisions based on the state of the system   3  Solution in some cases  The special case of r   4 can in fact be solved exactly  as can the case with r   2  however the general case can only be predicted statistically  The solution when r   4 is   where the initial condition parameter is given by   For rational   after a finite number of iterations maps into a periodic sequence  But almost all are irrational  and  for irrational   never repeats itself 舑 it is non periodic  This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos 舑 stretching and folding  the factor 2n shows the exponential growth of stretching  which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions  while the squared sine function keeps folded within the range  0  1    For r   4 an equivalent solution in terms of complex numbers instead of trigonometric functions is  where is either of the complex numbers  with modulus equal to 1  Just as the squared sine function in the trigonometric solution leads to neither shrinkage nor expansion of the set of points visited  in the latter solution this effect is accomplished by the unit modulus of    By contrast  the solution when r 2 is  for   Since for any value of other than the unstable fixed point 0  the term goes to 0 as n goes to infinity  so goes to the stable fixed point  4  Finding cycles of any length when r   4  For the r   4 case  from almost all initial conditions the iterate sequence is chaotic  Nevertheless  there exist an infinite number of initial conditions that lead to cycles  and indeed there exist cycles of length k for all integers k ≥ 1  We can exploit the relationship of the logistic map to the dyadic transformation  also known as the bit shift map  to find cycles of any length  If x follows the logistic map and y follows the dyadic transformation  then the two are related by  The reason that the dyadic transformation is also called the bit shift map is that when y is written in binary notation  the map moves the binary point one place to the right  and if the bit to the left of the binary point has become a  1   this  1  is changed to a  0    A cycle of length 3  for example  occurs if an iterate has a 3 bit repeating sequence in its binary expansion  which is not also a one bit repeating sequence   001  010  100  110  101  or 011  The iterate 001001001    maps into 010010010     which maps into 100100100     which in turn maps into the original 001001001     so this is a 3 cycle of the bit shift map  And the other three binary expansion repeating sequences give the 3 cycle 110110110    → 101101101    → 011011011    → 110110110     Either of these 3 cycles can be converted to fraction form  for example  the first given 3 cycle can be written as 1 7 → 2 7 → 4 7 → 1 7  Using the above translation from the bit shift map to the r   4 logistic map gives the corresponding logistic cycle  611260467    →  950484434    →  188255099    →  611260467      We could similarly translate the other bit shift 3 cycle into its corresponding logistic cycle  Likewise  cycles of any length k can be found in the bit shift map and then translated into the corresponding logistic cycles   However  since almost all numbers in  0  1  are irrational  almost all initial conditions of the bit shift map lead to the non periodicity of chaos  This is one way to see that the logistic r   4 map is chaotic for almost all initial conditions   Amount of cycles of  minimal  length k for logistic map with r   4  tent map with   is a known integer sequence   2  1  2  3  6  9  18  30  56  99  186  335  630  1161     It tells us that logistic map with r   4 has 2 fixed points  1 cycle of length 2  2 cycles of length 3 and so on  This sequence takes a particularly simple form for prime k    For example  is the number of cycles of length 13   5  See also  Logistic function  the continuous version  Lyapunov stability for iterated
