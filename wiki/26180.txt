REO Speedwagon  originally styled as R E O  Speedwagon  is an American rock band  Formed in 1967  the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s  Hi Infidelity  1980  contained four US Top 40 hits and is the group s best selling album  with over ten million copies sold   Over the course of its career  the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted thirteen Top 40 hits  including the number ones  Keep On Loving You  and  Can t Fight This Feeling   REO Speedwagon s mainstream popularity dissipated in the 1990s but the band remains a popular live act   1  History  1 1  Formation  In the fall of 1966  Neal Doughty entered the electrical engineering program at the University of Illinois in Champaign  Illinois  coming in as a junior  On his first night  he met another student  Alan Gratzer  They soon started a rock band  Gratzer had been a drummer since high school  and was playing in a local group on the weekends  while Doughty had learned some Beatles songs on his parents  piano   Doughty started to follow around Gratzer s band  eventually sitting in on a song or two  The keyboard player was the leader  but several other band members weren t happy with the situation  On the last day of the university s spring semester  guitarist Joe Matt called the band s leader and told him that he  drummer Gratzer  and bassist Mike Blair had decided to leave the band and start a new one with Doughty   They made a list of songs to learn over the summer break  and Doughty got a summer job to buy his first keyboard  On his Farfisa organ  he learned  Light My Fire  by The Doors  note for note   The members returned to school in the fall of 1967  and had their first rehearsal before classes even started  They named the band REO Speedwagon  from the REO Speed Wagon  a flatbed truck Doughty had studied in transportation history  and the initials are those of its founder Ransom E  Olds  Rather than pronouncing REO as a single word as the motor company did  they chose to spell out the name with the individual letters each pronounced  An ad in the school paper got them their first job—a fraternity party that turned into a food fight  They continued to perform cover songs in campus bars  fraternity parties  and university events  The first line up consisted of Doughty on keyboards  Gratzer on drums and vocals  Joe Matt on guitar and vocals  and Mike Blair on bass and vocals   In the spring of 1968  Terry Luttrell became lead singer  and Bob Crownover and Gregg Philbin replaced Matt and Blair  respectively  Marty Shepard played trumpet and Joe McCabe played sax at this time until McCabe moved to Southern Illinois University  Crownover played guitar for the group until the summer of 1969 when Bill Fiorio replaced him  Fiorio then departed in late 1969  eventually assuming the name Duke Tumatoe  and went on to form the All Star Frogs  Steve Scorfina  who would go on to found progressive rock AOR band Pavlov s Dog  came aboard for over a year  composing with the band and performing live  before being replaced by Gary Richrath in late 1970   Richrath was a Peoria  Illinois based guitarist and prolific songwriter who brought original material to the band including REO s signature song  Ridin  the Storm Out   With Richrath on board  the regional popularity of the band grew tremendously  The Midwestern United States was the original REO Speedwagon fan stronghold and is pivotal in this period of the band s history   The band signed to Epic Records in 1971  Paul Leka  an East Coast record producer  brought the band to his recording studio in Bridgeport  Connecticut where it recorded original material for its first album  The lineup on the first album consisted of Richrath  Gratzer  Doughty  Philbin  and Luttrell   1 2  Early years  With their equipment being hauled to dates in a friend s station wagon  REO played bars and clubs all over the Midwest  The band s debut album  R E O  Speedwagon  was released on Epic Records in 1971  The most popular track on this record was  157 Riverside Avenue   The title refers to the Westport  Connecticut address  where the band stayed while recording in Leka s studio in nearby Bridgeport and remains an in concert favorite   Although the rest of the band s line up remained stable  REO Speedwagon switched lead vocalists three times for their first three albums  Luttrell left the band in early 1972  eventually becoming the vocalist for Starcastle  He was replaced by Kevin Cronin  Cronin recorded one album with the band  1972 s R E O  T W O  but left the band during the recording sessions for 1973 s Ridin  the Storm Out because of internal conflicts  Ridin  the Storm Out was completed with Michael Bryan Murphy on lead vocal  Murphy stayed on for two more albums  Lost in a Dream and This Time We Mean It  before Cronin returned to the fold in January 1976 and recorded R E O   which was released that same year   Cronin s return came after Greg X  Volz turned down the position for lead vocalist due to his commitment to Christianity and Volz would instead go on to accept an offer made by Bob Hartman to join his band Petra as lead vocalist   In 1977 REO convinced Epic Records that their strength was in their live performances  Epic agreed to let them produce their first live album  Live  You Get What You Play For  which was certified platinum   In 1977 Philbin was replaced with Bruce Hall to record You Can Tune a Piano but You Can t Tuna Fish  released in 1978  which received FM radio airplay  The album was REO s first to make the Top 40  peaking at #29  The album sold over 2 million copies in the U S  achieving Double Platinum status   In 1979 the band took a turn back to hard rock with the release of Nine Lives   1 3  Mainstream success  The stage was now set for the band s most popular era  In the fall of 1980  REO Speedwagon released Hi Infidelity  which represented a change in the music from hard rock to more pop oriented material  Hi Infidelity spawned four hit singles written by Richrath and Cronin  including the #1  Keep On Loving You   Cronin   the #5  Take It on the Run   Richrath    In Your Letter   #20   Richrath   and  Don t Let Him Go   #24   Cronin   and remained on the charts for 65 weeks  32 of which were spent in the top ten  including 15 weeks atop the Billboard 200  Hi Infidelity sold over 10 million copies and set the bar for rock bands across the country   The band s follow up album  Good Trouble was released in 1982  Although it was not as successful as its predecessor  the album performed moderately well commercially  featuring the hit singles  Keep the Fire Burnin    U S  #7    Sweet Time   U S  #26  and the Album Rock chart hit  The Key    The band came storming back two years later with Wheels Are Turnin   an album that included the #1 hit single  Can t Fight This Feeling  plus three more hits   I Do  Wanna Know   U S  #29    One Lonely Night   U S  #19   and  Live Every Moment   U S  #34    On July 13  1985  the band made a stop in Philadelphia  en route to a show in Milwaukee  to play at the US Leg of Live Aid  which broke a record for number of viewers  They performed  Can t Fight This Feeling  and  Roll With the Changes   which featured members of the Beach Boys  the REO Speedwagon band members  families  and Paul Shaffer on stage for backing vocals   1987 s Life as We Know It saw a decline in sales  but still managed to provide the band with the top 20 hits  That Ain t Love   U S  #16  and  In My Dreams   U S  #19    1 4  Declining popularity  By the end of the 1980s  the band s popularity was waning  Gratzer retired in September 1988 after he decided to retire from music to open a restaurant  leaving Neal Doughty as the only remaining original member   In early 1989  Richrath ended up leaving over disagreements with Cronin regarding musical direction  Cronin had been playing in a jazz ensemble called  The Strolling Dudes  with jazz trumpet player Rick Braun  Miles Joseph on lead guitar and Graham Lear on drums  Lear had already been invited to join REO in September 1988 after Gratzer s departure and Joseph was brought in as a temporary guitarist  Back up singers Carla Day and Melanie Jackson were also added in 1989 to boost the group s vocal sound onstage  This lineup did only one show—on January 7  1989 in Viña del Mar  Chile—winning the award for best group at the city s annual International Song Festival  After that  Miles Joseph and the back up singers were dropped in favor of former Ted Nugent guitarist Dave Amato  who was brought aboard in May 1989  and keyboardist songwriter producer Jesse Harms  Eddie Money  Sammy Hagar    The 1990 release The Earth  a Small Man  His Dog and a Chicken  with Bryan Hitt  formerly of Wang Chung  replacing Graham Lear on drums  Dave Amato debuting on lead guitar  and songwriter keyboardist Jesse Harms  was a commercial disappointment  The album produced only one  and at this time the last  Billboard Hot 100 single   Love Is a Rock  at #66  Harms was disillusioned and his tenure in the group ended in early 1991   Shortly after his departure  Richrath assembled former members of the midwestern band Vancouver to form a namesake band  Richrath  After touring for several years  the Richrath band released Only the Strong Survive in 1992 on the GNP Crescendo label  Richrath continued to perform for several years before disbanding in the late 1990s   Without the guitar wizardry and song writing input from Richrath  REO Speedwagon lost their recording contract with Epic  and ended up releasing Building the Bridge  1996  on the Priority Rhythm Safari label  When that label went bankrupt  the album was released on the ill fated Castle Records which also experienced financial troubles  REO Speedwagon ultimately self financed this effort  which failed to chart   1 5  Revival of the hits  The commercial failure of the band s newer material with its revised lineup demanded a change in marketing strategy  As a consequence  Epic began re releasing recordings from older albums with updated artwork and design   From 1995 to the present  the label released over a dozen compilation albums featuring greatest hits  including 1999 s The Ballads  In 2000  REO teamed up with Styx for an appearance at Riverport Amphitheater in St  Louis  which was released as a live concert video Arch Allies  Live at Riverport  The REO portion of the show was released again under three separate titles  Live   Plus  2001   Live Plus 3  2001  and Extended Versions  2001   which was certified Gold by the RIAA on 4 26 2006   REO once again teamed with Styx in 2003 for the Classic Rock s Main Event tour which also included Journey   1 6  2000s 2010s  The band released a self financed album entitled Find Your Own Way Home in April 2007  Though it did not chart as an album  it produced two singles which appeared on Billboard s Adult Contemporary radio chart   REO Speedwagon continues to tour regularly  performing mostly their classic hits  They are popular on the fair and casino circuits  but still team with other acts to play large venues  They teamed up with Styx to record a new single entitled  Can t Stop Rockin    released in March 2009  as well as for a full tour that includes special guest  38 Special   In November 2009  REO Speedwagon released a Christmas album  Not So Silent Night   Christmas with REO Speedwagon   In summer 2010  the band – then touring with Pat Benatar – announced that it will release a 30th anniversary deluxe edition reissue of Hi Infidelity   On December 2  2009  REO Speedwagon released an online video game  Find Your Own Way Home  produced by digital design agency  Curious Sense  The game was the first  downloadable casual game  produced with a rock band and was cited by numerous publications including the New York Times as an innovative marketing product for a music act  REO Speedwagon headlined on the M&I Classic Rock Stage at the Milwaukee Summerfest on June 30  2011  On March 11  2012  Kevin Cronin appeared on the Canadian reality TV series Star Académie  He sang a sampling of REO s hits with the show s singing finalists   On November 22  2013  they announced a benefit concert with Styx titled  Rock to the Rescue  to raise money for the affected families of the tornadoes in central Illinois  The concert was held on December 4  2013 in Bloomington  Illinois  Richard Marx joined REO on stage for a joint performance of two of his hit songs  Gary Richrath reunited with REO for a performance of  Ridin  the Storm Out  to end REO s set at the sold out concert  Richrath stayed on stage to help with the encore of  With a Little Help From My Friends  along with REO  Styx  Richard Marx  and others  Richrath is originally from the town of East Peoria which was damaged during the storm  Families impacted by the storm and first responders sat near the stage for this special concert and REO reunion   In early 2014  it was announced that REO Speedwagon and Chicago would be teaming up for 15 dates
