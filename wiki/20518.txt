A metaphor is a figure of speech that identifies one thing as being the same as some unrelated other thing  thus strongly implying the similarities between the two  It is therefore considered more rhetorically powerful than a simile  While a simile compares two items  a metaphor directly equates them  and so does not apply any words of comparison  such as  like  or  as   Metaphor is a type of analogy and is closely related to other rhetorical figures of speech that achieve their effects via association  comparison or resemblance including allegory  hyperbole  and simile   One of the most prominent examples of a metaphor in English literature is the All the world s a stage monologue from As You Like It   All the world s a stage  And all the men and women merely players  They have their exits and their entrances  This quotation contains a metaphor because the world is not literally a stage  By figuratively asserting that the world is a stage  Shakespeare uses the points of comparison between the world and a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the world and the lives of the people within it   The Philosophy of Rhetoric  1937  by I  A  Richards describes a metaphor as having two parts  the tenor and the vehicle  The tenor is the subject to which attributes are ascribed  The vehicle is the object whose attributes are borrowed  In the previous example   the world  is compared to a stage  describing it with the attributes of  the stage    the world  is the tenor  and  a stage  is the vehicle   men and women  is the secondary tenor  and  players  is the secondary vehicle   Other writers employ the general terms ground and figure to denote the tenor and the vehicle  In cognitive linguistics  the terms target and source are used respectively   1  Etymology  The English metaphor derives from the 16th century Old French métaphore  which comes from the Latin metaphora   carrying over   in turn from the Greek μεταφορά  metaphorá    transfer   from μεταφέρω  metapherō    to carry over    to transfer  and that from μετά  meta    after  with  across  + φέρω  pherō    to bear    to carry    2  Comparison with other types of analogy  Metaphors are most frequently compared with similes  The Columbia Encyclopedia  6th edition  explains the difference as   Where a metaphor asserts the two objects in the comparison are identical on the point of comparison  a simile merely asserts a similarity  For this reason a metaphor is generally considered more forceful than a simile   The metaphor category also contains these specialised types   Allegory  An extended metaphor wherein a story illustrates an important attribute of the subject   Catachresis  A mixed metaphor used by design and accident  a rhetorical fault    Parable  An extended metaphor narrated as an anecdote illustrating and teaching such as in Aesop s fables  or Jesus  teaching method as told in the Bible   Pun  Similar to a metaphor  a pun alludes to another term  However the main difference is that a pun is a frivolous allusion between two different things whereas a metaphor is a purposeful allusion between two different things  Metaphor  like other types of analogy  can usefully be distinguished from metonymy as one of two fundamental modes of thought  Metaphor and analogy both work by bringing together two concepts from different conceptual domains  whereas metonymy works by using one element from a given domain to refer to another closely related element  Thus  a metaphor creates new links between otherwise distinct conceptual domains  whereas a metonymy relies on the existing links within them   3  Common types  A dead metaphor is one in which the sense of a transferred image is absent  Examples   to grasp a concept  and  to gather what you ve understood  use physical action as a metaphor for understanding  Most people do not visualize the action—dead metaphors normally go unnoticed  Some people distinguish between a dead metaphor and a cliché  Others use  dead metaphor  to denote both   A mixed metaphor is one that leaps from one identification to a second identification inconsistent with the first   I smell a rat       but I ll nip him in the bud —Irish politician Boyle Roche  This form is often used as a parody of metaphor itself   If we can hit that bull s eye then the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards    Checkmate   Futurama character Zapp Brannigan   4  Aristotle on Rhetoric  Aristotle said in his work  The Rhetoric  that metaphors make learning pleasant   To learn easily is naturally pleasant to all people  and words signify something  so whatever words create knowledge in us are the pleasantest   When discussing The Rhetoric  Jan Garret quoted how  Metaphor most brings about learning  for when  Homer  calls old age  stubble   he creates understanding and knowledge through the genus  since both old age and stubble are  species of the genus of  things that have lost their bloom   Metaphors  according to Aristotle  have  qualities of the exotic and the fascinating  but at the same time we recognize that strangers do not have the same rights as our fellow citizens    5  Uses outside of rhetoric  The term metaphor is also used for the following terms that are not a part of rhetoric   A cognitive metaphor is the association of object to an experience outside the object s environment  A conceptual metaphor is an underlying association that is systematic in both language and thought  A root metaphor is the underlying worldview that shapes an individual s understanding of a situation  A nonlinguistic metaphor is an association between two nonlinguistic realms of experience  A visual metaphor uses an image to create the link between different ideas Metaphors can also be implied and extended throughout pieces of literature   5 1  Conceptual metaphors  Some theorists have suggested that metaphors are not merely stylistic  but that they are cognitively important as well  In Metaphors We Live By  George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argue that metaphors are pervasive in everyday life  not just in language  but also in thought and action  A common definition of a metaphor can be described as a comparison that shows how two things that are not alike in most ways are similar in another important way  They explain how a metaphor is simply understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another  The authors call this concept a  conduit metaphor   By this they meant that a speaker can put ideas or objects into words or containers  and then send them along a channel  or conduit  to a listener who takes that idea or object out of the container and makes meaning of it  In other words  communication is something that ideas go into  The container is separate from the ideas themselves  Lakoff and Johnson give several examples of daily metaphors we use  such as  argument is war  and  time is money   Metaphors are widely used in context to describe personal meaning  The authors also suggest that communication can be viewed as a machine   Communication is not what one does with the machine  but is the machine itself    Johnson  Lakoff  1980    5 2  Nonlinguistic metaphors  Metaphors can also map experience between two nonlinguistic realms  In The Dream Frontier  Mark Blechner describes musical metaphors  in which a piece of music can  map  to the personality and emotional life of a person  Musicologist Leonard Meyer demonstrated how purely rhythmic and harmonic events can express human emotions   Art theorist Robert Vischer argued that when we look at a painting  we  feel ourselves into it  by imagining our body in the posture of a nonhuman or inanimate object in the painting  For example  the painting  The Solitary Tree  by Caspar David Friedrich shows a tree with contorted  barren limbs  In looking at that painting  we imagine our limbs in a similarly contorted and barren shape  and that creates a feeling in us of strain and distress  Nonlinguistic metaphors may be the foundation of our experience of visual  musical  dance  and other art forms   6  In historical linguistics  In historical onomasiology or in historical linguistics  a metaphor is defined as a semantic change based on a similarity in form or function between the original concept named by a word and the target concept named by this word   For example  mouse  small  gray rodent → small  gray  mouse shaped computer device   Some recent linguistic theories view language as by its nature all metaphorical  or that language in essence is metaphorical   7  Historical theories of metaphor  Friedrich Nietzsche s On Truth and Lies in the Non Moral Sense makes metaphor the conceptual centre of his early theory of society  Some sociologists have found this an essay useful for thinking about metaphors at use in society  as well as for reflecting on their own use of metaphor  Sociologists of religion  for example  note the importance of metaphor in religious worldviews  but also that it is impossible to think sociologically about religion without metaphor  7 1  Metaphor as style in speech and writing  Viewed as an aspect of speech and writing  metaphor qualifies as style  in particular  style characterized by a type of analogy  An expression  word  phrase  that by implication suggests the likeness of one entity to another entity gives style to an item of speech or writing  whether the entities consist of objects  events  ideas  activities  attributes  or almost anything expressible in language  For example  in the first sentence of this paragraph  the word  viewed  serves as a metaphor for  thought of   implying analogy of the process of seeing and the thought process  The phrase   viewed as an aspect of   projects the properties of seeing  vision  something from a particular perspective onto thinking about something from a particular perspective  that  something  in this case referring to  metaphor  and that  perspective  in this case referring to the characteristics of speech and writing   As a characteristic of speech and writing  metaphors can serve the poetic imagination  Sylvia Plath  in her poem  Cut   to compare the blood issuing from her cut thumb to the running of a million soldiers   redcoats  every one   and  enabling Robert Frost  in  The Road Not Taken   to compare one s life to a journey   Viewed also as an aspect of speech  metaphor can serve as a device for persuading the listener or reader of the speaker or writer s argument or thesis  the so called rhetorical metaphor   7 2  Metaphor as foundational to our conceptual system  Cognitive linguists emphasize that metaphors serve to facilitate the understanding of one conceptual domain  typically an abstract one like  life  or  theories  or  ideas   through expressions that relate to another  more familiar conceptual domain  typically a more concrete one like  journey  or  buildings  or  food   Food for thought  we devour a book of raw facts  try to digest them  stew over them  let them simmer on the back burner  regurgitate them in discussions  cook up explanations  hoping they do not seem half baked  Theories as buildings  we establish a foundation for them  a framework  support them with strong arguments  buttressing them with facts  hoping they will stand  Life as journey  some of us travel hopefully  others seem to have no direction  many lose their way   Lakoff and Johnson  1980  1999  greatly contributed to establishing the importance of conceptual metaphor as a framework for thinking in language  In recent years many scholars have investigated the original ways in which writers use novel metaphors and question the fundamental frameworks of thinking implicit in conceptual metaphors   When considering the role conceptual metaphor plays in the worldview of the community  the problem becomes twofold  From a sociological  cultural  or philosophical perspective  the question becomes  to what extent ideologies maintain and impose conceptual patterns of thought by introducing  supporting  and adapting fundamental patterns of thinking metaphorically  To what extent does the ideology fashion and refashion the idea of the nation as a container with borders  How are enemies and outsiders represented  As diseases  As attackers  How are the metaphoric paths of fate  destiny  history  and progress represented  As the opening of an eternal monumental moment  German fascism   Or as the path to communism  in Russian or Czech for example    Though cognitive scholars have made some attempts to take on board the idea that different languages have evolved radically different concepts and conceptual metaphors  they have on the whole remained tied up in the somewhat reductive concept of worldview which derives from the Sapir Whorf hypothesis  The true source of ethnolinguistics and the thinker who contributed most to the debate on the relationship between culture  language  and linguistic communities was the German philologist Wilhelm von Humboldt  1767–1835   Humboldt remains  however  little known in English speaking nations  Andrew Goatly  in  Washing the Brain   John Benjaminns 2007  does take on board the dual problem of conceptual metaphor as a framework implicit in the language as a system  and the way individuals and ideologies negotiate conceptual metaphors   James W  Underhill  in Creating Worldviews  Ideology  Metaphor & Language  Edinburgh UP   considers the way individual speech adopts and reinforces certain metaphoric paradigms  This involves a critique of both communist and fascist discourse  But Underhill s studies are situated in Czech and German  which allows him to demonstrate the ways individuals are both thinking  within   and resisting the modes by which ideologies seek to appropriate key concepts such as  the people    the state    history   and  struggle    Though metaphors can be considered to be  in  language  Underhill s chapter on French  English and ethnolinguistics demonstrates that we cannot conceive of language or languages in anything other than metaphoric terms  French is a treasure  for example  English is a  tool  for liberating minorities engaging in debate in the global world  Underhill continues his investigation of the relationship between worldview and language in Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts  Truth
