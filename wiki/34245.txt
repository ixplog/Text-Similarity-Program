Yemen is one of the oldest centers of civilization in the Near East  Its relatively fertile land and adequate rainfall in a moister climate helped sustain a stable population  a feature recognized by the ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy  who described Yemen as Eudaimon Arabia  better known in its Latin translation  Arabia Felix  meaning  fortunate Arabia  or Happy Arabia   The Nomadic Semites from the Yemeni desert regions  Rub  al Khali and Sayhad  migrated to the North  settling Akkad  later penetrating Mesopotamia  eventually conquering Sumer by 2300 BCE  and assimilating the Amorites of Syria   Some scholars believe that Yemen remains the only region in the world that is exclusively Semitic  meaning that Yemen historically did not have any non–Semitic speaking people  Yemeni Semites derived their Musnad script by the 12th to 8th centuries BCE  which explains why most historians date all of the ancient Yemeni kingdoms to the 12th to 8th centuries BCE   Between the 12th century BCE and the 6th century CE  it was dominated by six successive civilizations which rivaled each other  or were allied with each other and controlled the lucrative spice trade  M ain  Qataban  Hadhramaut  Awsan  Saba and Himyarite  Islam arrived in 630 CE  and Yemen became part of the Muslim realm   1  Prehistory  According to Arab tradition  the Semites of South Arabia integrated into Qahtan lineage 40 generations before the Qahtani Yemeni tribe of Jurhum adopted Ismail and 80 generations before Adnan was born  in the 23rd century BCE  After the fall of the Northern Semitic cultures  Qahtan revived the Semitic influence in the North through the famous Kahlan  Azd and Lakhm  and other Yemenite tribes migration into the North during the 3rd century CE after the first destruction of the Marib Dam  The Horn of Africa s first Semitic nation  Dʿmt  was a Yemeni settlement   The Qahtani Semites remained dominant in Yemen from 2300 BCE to 800 BCE  but little is known about this era because the Semites of the South were separated by the vast Arabian desert from Mesopotamian Semites and they lacked any type of script to record their history  However  it is known that they actively traded along the Red Sea coasts  This led to contact with the Phoenicians and from them  the Southern Semites adopted their writing script in 800 BCE and began recording their history   The Tihama Semitic culture lasted from 1500 1200 BCE  During the late 2nd millennium BCE  a cultural Semitic complex arose in the Tihamah region of Yemen and spread to northern Ethiopia and Eritrea  specifically the Tigray Region  central Eritrea  and coastal areas like Adulis   The Semites of Yemen began settling the Ethiopian highlands  These settlements would reach their climax by the 8th century BCE  eventually giving rise to the Dʿmt and Aksum kingdoms  2  Kingdoms  During the rule of the Sabaeans  8th century BCE to 275 CE  trade and agriculture flourished generating much wealth and prosperity  The Sabaean kingdom is located in what is now the Aseer region in southwestern Yemen  and its capital  Ma rib  is located near what is now Yemen s modern capital  Sana a   During Sabaean rule  Yemen was called  Arabia Felix  by the Romans who were impressed by its wealth and prosperity  The success of the Kingdom was based on the cultivation and trade of spices and aromatics including frankincense and myrrh  These were exported to the Mediterranean  India  and Abyssinia where they were greatly prized by many cultures  using camels on routes through Arabia  and to India by sea   During the 8th century BCE  The Sabaens established a colony in northern Ethiopia  building the first Temple in Yeha and introducing the alphabet to the natives Agriculture in Yemen thrived during this time due to an advanced irrigation system which consisted of large water tunnels in mountains  and dams  The most impressive dam  known as the dam of Ma rib was built ca  700 BCE  provided irrigation for about of land and stood for over a millennium  finally collapsing in CE 570 after centuries of neglect   The Sabaean kingdom  with its capital at Ma rib where the remains of a large temple can still be seen  thrived for almost 14 centuries  Some have argued that this kingdom was the Sheba described in the Old Testament  The first known inscriptions of the Kingdom of Hadramaut are from the 8th century BCE  It was first referenced by an outside civilization in an Old Sabaic inscription of Karab il Watar from the early 7th century BCE  in which the King of Hadramaut  Yadail  is mentioned as being one of his allies  When the Minaeans took control of the caravan routes in the 4th century BCE  however  Hadramaut became one of its confederates  probably because of commercial interests  It later became independent and was invaded by the growing kingdom of Himyar toward the end of the first century BC  but it was able to repel the attack  Hadramaut annexed Qataban in the second half of the 2nd century AD  reaching its greatest size  During this period  Hadramaut was continuously at war with Himyar and Saba   and the Sabaean king Sha irum Awtar was even able to take its capital  Shabwa  in 225  During this period the Kingdom of Aksum began to interfere in South Arabian affairs  King GDRT of Aksum acted by dispatching troops under his son  BYGT  sending them from the western coast to occupy Zafar  the Himyarite capital  as well as from the southern coast against Hadramaut as Sabaean allies  The kingdom of Hadramaut was eventually conquered by the Himyarite king Shammar Yuhar ish around 300 CE  unifying all of the South Arabian kingdoms   The ancient Kingdom of Awsan with a capital at Hagar Yahirr in the wadi Markha to the south of the wadi Bayhan is now marked by a tell or artificial mound  which is locally named Hagar Asfal  Once it was one of the most important small kingdoms of South Arabia   The city  which has its origin in 800 BC  seems to have been destroyed in the 7th century BCE by the king and mukarrib of Saba Karib il Watar  according to a Sabaean text that reports the victory in terms that attest to its significance for the Sabaeans   Qataban  which lasted from the 4th century BCE to 200 CE  was one of the ancient Yemeni kingdoms which thrived in the Baihan valley  Like the other Southern Arabian kingdoms it gained great wealth from the trade of frankincense and myrrh incense which were burned at altars  The capital of Qataban was named Timna and was located on the trade route which passed through the other kingdoms of Hadramaut  Saba and Ma in  The chief deity of the Qatabanians was Amm  or  Uncle  and the people called themselves the  children of Amm    2 1  Kingdom of Ma in  During Minaean rule the capital was at Karna  now known as Sadah   Their other important city was Yathill  now known as Baraqish   Other parts of modern Yemen include Qataban and the coastal string of watering stations known as the Hadhramaut  Though Saba  dominated in the earlier period of South Arabian history  Minaic inscriptions are of the same time period as the first Sabaic inscriptions  Note  however  that they pre date the appearance of the Minaeans themselves  and  hence  are called now more appropriately as  Madhabic  rather than  Minaic   The Minaean Kingdom was centered in northwestern Yemen  with most of its cities laying along the Wadi Madhab  Minaic inscriptions have been found far afield of the Kingdom of Ma in  as far away as al  Ula in northwestern Saudi Arabia and even on the island of Delos and in Egypt  It was the first of the South Arabian kingdoms to end  and the Minaic language died around 100 CE   2 2  Kingdom of Himyar  In the 1st century BCE the Himyarites had united most of Southwestern Arabia after the conquest of Qataban and Saba   controlling the Red Sea as well as the coasts of the Gulf of Aden  In the early 2nd century CE Saba  and Qataban split from the Kingdom of Ḥimyar  yet in a few decades Qataban was conquered by Hadramawt  conquered in its turn by Ḥimyar in the 4th century   whereas Saba  was finally conquered by Ḥimyar in the late 3rd century CE  From their capital city  the Himyarite Kings launched successful military campaigns  and had stretched its domain at times as far east as the Persian Gulf and as far north to the Arabian Desert   During the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE  the South Arabian kingdoms were in continuous conflict with one another  GDRT of Aksum began to interfere in South Arabian affairs  signing an alliance with Saba   and a Himyarite text notes that Hadramaut and Qataban were also all allied against the kingdom  As a result of this  the Kingdom of Aksum was able to capture the Himyarite capital of Zafar in the first quarter of the 3rd century  However  the alliances did not last  and Sha ir Awtar of Saba  unexpectedly turned on Hadramaut  allying again with Aksum and taking its capital in 225  Himyar then allied with Saba  and invaded the newly taken Aksumite territories  retaking Zafar  which had been under the control of GDRT s son BYGT  and pushing Aksum back into the Tihama   They established their capital at Zafar  now just a small village in the Ibb region  and gradually absorbed the Sabaean kingdom  They traded from the port of al Mocha on the Red Sea  Dhu Nuwas  a Himyarite king  changed the state religion to Judaism in the beginning of the 6th century and began to make war against the Christians and Ethiopians who took advantage of the unrest  Dhu Nuwas killed over 22 000 Abyssinians and was not defeated until Justinian I sent a fleet to Yemen around 525 The Western coasts of Yemen and part of Hejaz across the shores of Ethiopia became a vassal state while the rest of the country was ruled by various tribal elites in 531  an Ethiopian commander Abraha sent to roman citizen killed the Himyarite Viceroy and declared himself  King of Saba   Kaleb sent two armies that were defeated The country entered a chaotic phase and abraha managed to stay in power by forming alliances with tribes against other  He was challenged with stiff resistance from the Kindah tribe He was able to defeat the kendite chief  Yazid Bin Kabshat  with the help of Banu Hamdan and other Yemeni tribes by 570  a noble Himyarite Jew managed to partly regain the rule of his family with the help of Sassanid Persians The Persians never ruled or annexed Yemen  A lot of modern scholars refer to the contradicting references of tribal elites ruling large portions of the country and believe that the accounts given by Islamic historians was meant to portray Islam as a  liberator  of Arabs As there are no archaeological accounts for the alleged Persian rule   3  Medieval history  Islam came to Yemen around 630  during the Islamic prophet Muhammad s lifetime  At that time the Persian governor Badhan was ruling  Thereafter Yemen was ruled as part of Arab Islamic caliphates  and Yemen became a province in the Islamic empire   It was only after the arrival of Islam that most of Yemen began to shift to Arabic language   Yemeni textiles  long recognized for their fine quality  maintained their reputation and were exported for use by the Abbasid elite  including the caliphs themselves  The products of Sana a and Aden are especially important in the East West textile trade   When the Abbasid Caliphate declined in the 9th century  the Yemeni lands fell under various competing regimes  Part of the highland in former North Yemen came under control of Imams of various Zaidi sect  who established a theocratic political structure that survived until modern times  The first Zaidi ruler was Yahya al Hadi ila l Haqq  who founded a line of imams  the Rassids in 897  Although he did not create a stable state  his Shiite successors ruled in the northern highlands for most of the period up to the second half of the 20th century   Nevertheless  Yemen s medieval history is a tangled chronicle of contesting local rulers  The Tihama lowland was governed by the Ziyadid dynasty in 818 1018  first as Abbasid governors and then as independent kings  They were succeeded by the Ethiopian Najahids in 1022 1158  Other dynasties held sway in the southern highlands  The Fatimids of Egypt helped the Isma ilis maintain dominance in the 11th century through the Sulayhid dynasty  founded and brought to peak by Ali al Sulayhi between 1047 1063  Ali s daughter in law Arwa al Sulayhi wieled power as ruling queen in 1086 1138  Being one of the few Muslim women rulers in the Arab world  she is praised as virtuous and politically skilled   Turan Shah annexed Yemen to the Ayyubid Empire of Saladin in 1174  With this feat  almost the entire Yemen was united under one rule for the first time since the Abbasid heyday  The Rasulid dynasty ruled Yemen  with Zabid as its capital  from 1229 to 1454  Of all the medieval Yemini dynasties  they were the most enduring and prosperous  The sultans of this dynasty were Sunni  as were their successors  the Tahirids  In 1517  the Mamluks of Egypt defeated the Tahirids and annexed Yemen  but in the same year  the Mamluk governor surrendered to the Ottomans  Turkish armies subsequently overran the country after 1538  They were challenged by the Zaidi Imam  Qasim the Great  r 1597舑1620   and were expelled from the interior around 1629  The Ottomans retained control of the coastal areas until 1635 when they were forced to leave   The descendants of Imam Qasim  the Qasimids  subsequently ruled an extensive but highly decentralized realm that also encompassed Hadramawt and Dhofar  Up to the 1720s Yemen was the only exporter of coffee in the world  which gave the imams a financial basis to wield power  However  the territory of the Qasimids began to shrink after 1681  and in 1731 they lost the important port Aden  Although the dignity of imam was not strictly speaking hereditary but depending on personal qualifications  the imams adopted royal trappings by the late 17th century and were usually succeeded by their sons or close kin  Yemen in this period has been characterized as a quasi state with an inherent conflict between autonomous tribal groups and the Zaidi regime based in Sana a   4  Ottoman influence  Declining coffee incomes  Wahhabite incursions after 1800  tribal uprisings  and power struggles among the Qasimid descendants  contributed to the decline of the imamic state  After 1849 the Zaidi Imamate collapsed entirely due to the internal divisions  Meanwhile the Ottomans moved south along the west coast of Arabia  Forces of the Egyptian viceroy intervened in northern Yemen in the 1830s  and in 1849 Ottoman troops secured Tihama  In 1872 they eventually took San a  which they made the Yemeni district capital  The Ottomans were aided by the adoption of modern weapons which they were acquainted with since the Crimean War   British interests in the area which would later become South Yemen  began to grow when in 1839  British East India Company forces captured the port of Aden  to provide a coaling station for ships en route to India  The British designs in protecting the route to India led to their establishing the Aden Settlement  subordinated to the Bombay Presidency  over the town of Aden and its harbor in 1839  The colony gained much political and strategic importance after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the increased traffic on the Red Sea route to India  The Ottomans and the British eventually established a de facto border between north and south Yemen  which was formalized in a treaty in 1904  However the interior boundaries were never clearly established  However the presence of the Ottomans  and to a lesser extent the British  allowed the Zaydi Imamate to rebuild against a common enemy  Guerrilla warfare and banditry erupted into the rebellion of the Zaydi tribes in 1905   Starting in the latter decades of the 19th century and continuing into the 20th century  Britain signed agreements with local rulers of traditional polities that  together  became known as the Aden Protectorate  The area was divided into numerous sultanates  emirates  and sheikhdoms  and was divided for administrative purposes into the East Aden Protectorate and the West Aden Protectorate  The eastern protectorate consisted of the three Hadhramaut states  Qu aiti State of Shihr and Mukalla  Kathiri State of Seiyun  Mahra State of Qishn and Socotra  with the remaining states comprising the west   Ottoman suzerainty was reestablished in northern Yemen in the late 19th century but its control was largely confined to cities  and the Zaidi imam s rule over Upper Yemen was formally recognized  Turkish forces withdrew in 1918  and Imam Yahya Muhammad strengthened his control over northern Yemen creating the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen   The Aden Settlement became Aden Province in 1932  Finally in 1937 Aden was separated from British India and was transferred to the Colonial Office as a Crown Colony  a status that it retained until 1963   5  Modern history  5 1  Mutawakkilite kingdom and southern protectorates  The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen engaged in hostilities with the House of Saud  feuding over Asir  The conflict escalated into a full fledged war in 1934  though it did not result in any territorial changes   Aden was ruled as part of British India until 1937  when the city of Aden became the Colony of Aden  a crown colony in its own right  The Aden hinterland and Hadhramaut to the east formed the remainder of what would become South Yemen and were not administered directly by Aden but were tied to Britain by treaties of protection  Economic development was largely centred in Aden  and while the city flourished partly due to the discovery of crude oil on the Arabian Peninsula in the 1930s  the states of the Aden Protectorate stagnated   Yemen became a member of the Arab League in 1945 and the United Nations in 1947   Imam Yahya died during an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1948 and was succeeded by his son Ahmad  Ahmad bin Yahya s reign was marked by growing economic and political reforms  renewed friction with the United Kingdom over the British presence in the south  and growing pressures to support the Arab nationalist objectives of Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser  He died in September 1962   The Aden Trade Union Congress  ATUC or TUC  was founded during serious labour disturbances in the Aden Colony in 1956  The Secretary General of the trade union was Abdullah Asnag  a pro independence Arab nationalist and admirer of Nasser who also advocated union with Yemen  Supported by the UAR the ATUC rose in importance when the political disturbances and the violence reached a head and political parties ceased to function  By 1959 it was the only entity representing nationalist aspirations in Aden and it used its leverage to boycott elections as the main grouping of the People s Union  In November 1960 the ATUC boycotted the Aden municipal elections   Encouraged by the rhetoric of President Nasser of Egypt against British colonial rule in the Middle East  pressure for the British to leave South Yemen grew  Following Nasser s creation of the United Arab Republic  attempts to incorporate Yemen in turn threatened Aden and the Protectorate  To counter this  the British attempted to unite the various states under its protection and  on 11 February 1959  six of the West Aden Protectorate states formed the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South to which nine other states were subsequently added   Shortly after assuming power in 1962  Ahmad s son  the Crown Prince Muhammad al Badr was deposed by coup forces  who took control of Sanaa and created the Yemen Arab Republic  YAR   Egypt assisted the YAR with troops and supplies to combat forces loyal to the Kingdom  Saudi Arabia and Jordan supported Badr s royalist forces to oppose the newly formed republic starting the North Yemen Civil War  Conflict continued periodically until 1967 when Egyptian troops were withdrawn   During the 1960s  the British sought to incorporate all of the Aden Protectorate territories into the Federation  On 18 January 1963  the Colony of Aden was incorporated against the wishes of much of the city s populace as the State of Aden and the Federation was renamed the Federation of South Arabia  Several more states subsequently joined the Federation and the remaining ones that declined to join  mainly in Hadhramaut  formed the Protectorate of South Arabia   In 1963 fighting between Egyptian forces and British led Saudi financed guerrillas in the Yemen Arab Republic spread to South Arabia with the formation of the National Liberation Front  NLF   who hoped to force the British out of South Arabia  Hostilities started with a grenade attack by the NLF against the British High Commissioner on 10 December 1963  killing one person and injuring fifty  and a state of emergency was declared  becoming known as the Aden Emergency   In January 1964  the British moved into the Radfan hills in the border region to confront Egyptian backed guerrillas  later reinforced by the NLF  By October they had largely been suppressed  and the NLF switched to grenade attacks against off duty military personnel and police officers elsewhere in the Aden Colony   In 1964  the new British government under Harold Wilson announced their intention to hand over power to the Federation of South Arabia in 1968  but that the British military would remain  In 1964  there were around 280 guerrilla attacks and over 500 in 1965  In 1966 the British Government announced that all British forces would be withdrawn at independence  In response  the security situation deteriorated with the creation of the socialist Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen  FLOSY  which started to attack the NLF in a bid for power  as well as attacking the British   In January 1967  there were mass riots by NLF and FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town  which continued until mid February  despite the intervention of British troops  During the period there were many attacks on the troops  and an Aden Airlines Douglas DC 3 plane was destroyed in the air with no survivors  At the same time  the members of FLOSY and the NLF were also killing each other in large numbers   The temporary closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 effectively negated the last reason that British had kept hold of the colonies in Yemen  and  in the face of uncontrollable violence  they began to withdraw   On 20 June 1967  there was a mutiny in the Federation of South Arabia Army  which also spread to the police  Order was restored by the British  mainly due to the efforts of the 1st Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders  under the command of Lt Col  Colin Campbell Mitchell   Nevertheless  deadly guerrilla attacks particularly by the NLF soon resumed against British forces once again  with the British being defeated and driven from Aden by the end of November 1967  earlier than had been planned by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and without an agreement on the succeeding governance  Their enemies  the NLF  managed to seize power  with Aden itself under NLF control  The Royal Marines  who had been the first British troops to occupy Aden in 1839  were the last to leave  The Federation of South Arabia collapsed and Southern Yemen became independent as the People s Republic of South Yemen  The NLF  with the support of the army  attained total control of the new state after defeating the FLOSY and the states of the former Federation in a drawn out campaign of terror   Most of the opposing leaders reconciled by 1968  in the aftermath of a final royalist siege of San a   In 1970  Saudi Arabia recognized the Yemen Arab Republic and a ceasefire was effected   A radical  Marxist  wing of the NLF gained power in South Yemen in June 1969   5 2  South and North Yemen  The NLF changed the name of South Yemen on 1 December 1970 to the People s Democratic Republic of Yemen  PDRY   In the PDRY  all political parties were amalgamated into the Yemeni Socialist Party  YSP   which became the only legal party  The PDRY established close ties with the Soviet Union  People s Republic of China  Cuba  and radical Palestinians   The major communist powers assisted in the building of the PDRYs armed forces  Strong support from Moscow resulted in Soviet naval forces gaining access to naval facilities in South Yemen   Unlike East and West Germany  the two Yemens remained relatively friendly  though relations were often strained  In 1972 it was declared unification would eventually occur   However  in October 1972 fighting erupted between North Yemen and South Yemen  North Yemen was supplied by Saudi Arabia and South Yemen by the USSR  Fighting was short lived and the conflict led to the October 28  1972 Cairo Agreement  which set forth a plan to unify the two countries   Fighting broke out again in February and March 1979  with South Yemen allegedly supplying aid to rebels in the north through the National Democratic Front and crossing the border  Southern forces made it as far as the city of Taizz before withdrawing  This conflict was also short lived   The war was only stopped by an Arab League intervention  The goal of unity was reaffirmed by the northern and southern heads of state during a summit meeting in Kuwait in March 1979   What the PDRY government failed to tell the YAR government was that it wished to be the dominant power in any unification  and left wing rebels in North Yemen began to receive extensive funding and arms from South Yemen   In 1980  PDRY president Abdul Fattah Ismail resigned and went into exile  His successor  Ali Nasir Muhammad  took a less interventionist stance toward both North Yemen and neighbouring Oman  On January 13  1986  a violent struggle  known as South Yemen Civil War began in Aden between Ali Nasir s supporters and supporters of the returned Ismail  who wanted power back  Fighting lasted for more than a month and resulted in thousands of casualties  Ali Nasir s ouster  and Ismail s death  Some 60 000 people  including the deposed Ali Nasir  fled to the YAR   Efforts toward unification proceeded from 1988  See also  Aden  Aden Protectorate  Federation of South Arabia  Hadhramaut  and the People s Democratic Republic of Yemen  Although the governments of the PDRY and the YAR declared that they approved a future union in 1972  little progress was made toward unification  and relations were often strained   In May 1988  the YAR and PDRY governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions including agreement to renew discussions concerning unification  to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border  to demilitarize the border  and to allow Yemenis unrestricted border passage on the basis of only a national identification card   In November 1989  the leaders of the YAR  Ali Abdullah Saleh  and the PDRY  Ali Salim al Baidh  agreed on a draft unity constitution originally drawn up in 1981   5 3  Unified Yemen  5 3 1  Unification  The Republic of Yemen  ROY  was declared on 22 May 1990 with Saleh becoming President and al Baidh Vice President  For the first time in centuries  much of Greater Yemen was politically united  A 30 month transitional period for completing the unification of the two political and economic systems was set  A presidential council was jointly elected by the 26 member YAR advisory council and the 17 member PDRY presidium  The presidential council appointed a Prime Minister  who formed a Cabinet  There was also a 301 seat provisional unified parliament  consisting of 159 members from the north  111 members from the south  and 31 independent members appointed by the chairman of the council   A unity constitution was agreed upon in May 1990 and ratified by the populace in May 1991  It affirmed Yemen s commitment to free elections  a multiparty political system  the right to own private property  equality under the law  and respect of basic human rights  Parliamentary elections were held on 27 April 1993  International groups assisted in the organization of the elections and observed actual balloting  The resulting Parliament included 143 GPC  69 YSP  63 Islaah  Yemeni grouping for reform  a party composed of various tribal and religious groups   six Baathis  three Nasserists  two Al Haq  and 15 independents  The head of Islaah  Paramount Hashid Sheik Abdallah Bin Husayn Al Ahmar  is the speaker of Parliament   In late 1991 through early 1992  deteriorating economic conditions led to significant domestic unrest  including several riots  Legislative elections were nonetheless held in early 1993  and in May the two former ruling parties  the GPC and the YSP  merged to create a single political party with an overall majority in the new House of Representatives  In August Vice President al Baydh exiled himself voluntarily to Aden  and the country’s general security situation deteriorated as political rivals settled scores and tribal elements took advantage of the widespread unrest  In January 1994  representatives of the main political parties signed a document of pledge and accord in Amman  Jordan  that was designed to resolve the ongoing crisis  Despite this  clashes intensified until civil war broke out in early May 1994   5 3 2  1994 Civil War  Almost all of the actual fighting in the 1994 civil war occurred in the southern part of the country despite air and missile attacks against cities and major installations in the north  Southerners sought support from neighboring states and received billions of dollars of equipment and financial assistance  mostly from Saudi Arabia  which felt threatened by a united Yemen  The United States strongly supported Yemeni unity  but repeatedly called for a cease fire and a return to the negotiating table  Various attempts  including by a UN special envoy  were unsuccessful to effect a cease fire   Southern leaders declared secession and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen  DRY  on 21 May 1994  but the DRY was not recognized by the international community  Ali Nasir Muhammad supporters greatly assisted military operations against the secessionists and Aden was captured on 7 July 1994  Other resistance quickly collapsed and thousands of southern leaders and military went into exile  Early during the fighting  President Ali Abdallah Salih announced a general amnesty which applied to everyone except a list of 16 persons  Most southerners returned to Yemen after a short exile   An armed opposition was announced from Saudi Arabia  but no significant incidents within Yemen materialized  The government prepared legal cases against four southern leaders  Ali Salim al Baidh  Haydar Abu Bakr Al Attas  Abd Al Rahman Ali Al Jifri  and Salih Munassar Al Siyali—for misappropriation of official funds  Others on the list of 16 were told informally they could return to take advantage of the amnesty  but most remained outside Yemen  Although many of Ali Nasir Muhammad s followers were appointed to senior governmental positions  including Vice President  Chief of Staff  and Governor of Aden   Ali Nasir Muhammad himself remained abroad in Syria   In the aftermath of the civil war  YSP leaders within Yemen reorganized the party and elected a new politburo in July 1994  However  the party remained disheartened and without its former influence  Islaah held a party convention in September 1994  The GPC did the same in June 1995   In 1994  amendments to the unity constitution eliminated the presidential council  President Ali Abdallah Saleh was elected by Parliament on 1 October 1994 to a 5 year term  The constitution provides that henceforth the President will be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates selected by the legislature  Yemen held its first direct presidential elections in September 1999  electing President Ali Abdallah Salih to a 5 year term in what were generally considered free and fair elections  Yemen held its second multiparty parliamentary elections in April 1997   Constitutional amendments adopted in the summer of 2000 extended the presidential term by 2 years  creating a 7 year presidential term  The constitution provides that henceforth the president will be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates selected by the legislature  The amendments also extended the parliamentary term of office to a 6 year term  with the next elections supposed to take place in 2012  On February 20  2001  a new constitutional amendment created a bicameral legislature consisting of a Shura Council  111 seats  members appointed by the president  and a House of Representatives  301 seats  members elected by popular vote   In April 2003  the third multiparty parliamentary elections were held with improvements in voter registration for both men and women and in a generally free and fair atmosphere  Two women were elected  In September 2006  citizens re elected President Saleh to a second term in a generally open and competitive election  although there were multiple problems with the voting process and use of state resources on behalf of the ruling party   5 3 3  Destabilization and insurgency campaigns  In the 2000s the government has been fighting numerous rebel groups  such as the one led by Hussein al Houthi s Zaydi movement Shabab al Mu mineen   The Young Believers   In 2009  armed insurgency also resumed in southern Yemen  led by South Yemen Movement successors   The 2011 Yemeni protests followed the initial stages of the Arab Spring and began simultaneously with the Egyptian Revolution  The protests were initially against unemployment  economic conditions and corruption  as well as against the government s proposals to modify the constitution of Yemen  The protestors  demands then escalated to calls for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to resign   The situation however quickly deteriorated into a widescale uprising  with various insurgency campaigns consolidating into an armed tribal struggles  both between the armed opposition and terror groups vs  the government and among themselves  Despite the assassination attempt on Saleh  and the eventually signed Saudi brockered agreement on Saleh s resignation the conflict kept inflicting casualties nationwide in late 2011   6  See also  History of
