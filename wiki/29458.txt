Smallfilms is a British company that made animated television programmes for children  from 1959 to the 1980s  In 2014 the company was operating again and producing a remake of the Clangers  It was originally a partnership between Oliver Postgate  writer  animator and narrator  and Peter Firmin  modelmaker and illustrator   Several very popular series of short films were made using stop motion animation  including The Clangers  Noggin the Nog  and Ivor the Engine  Another Smallfilms production  Bagpuss  came top of a BBC poll to find the favourite children s programme   1  Background  In 1957 Postgate was appointed a stage manager with Associated Rediffusion  which then held the commercial weekday television franchise for London  Attached to the children s programming section  he thought he could do better with the relatively low budgets of the then black and white television productions   Postgate wrote Alexander the Mouse  a story about a mouse born to be king  Using an Irish produced magnetic system – on which animated characters were attached to a painted background  and then photographed through a 45 degree mirror – he persuaded Peter Firmin  who was then teaching at the Central School of Art  to create the background scenes  Postgate later recalled they undertook around 26 of these programmes live to air  which were made harder by the production problems encountered by the use and restrictions of using magnets   After the relative success of Alexander the Mouse  Postgate agreed a deal to make the next series on film  for a budget of £175 per programme  Making a stop motion animation table in his bedroom  he wrote the Chinese story The Journey of Master Ho  This was intended for deaf children  a distinct advantage in that the production required no soundtrack which reduced the production costs  He engaged a painter to produce the backgrounds  but as the painter was classical Chinese trained he produced them in three quarters view  rather than in the conventional Egyptian full view manner used for flat animation under a camera  This resulted in the Firmin produced characters looking like they were short in one leg  but the success of the production provided the foundation for Postgate and Firmin to start up their own company solely producing animated children s programmes   2  History  Setting up their business in a disused cowshed at Firmin s home in Blean near Canterbury  Kent  Postgate and Firmin worked on children s animation programmes  Based on concepts which mostly originated with Postgate  Firmin did the artwork and built the models  while Postgate wrote the scripts  did the stop motion filming and many of the voices  Smallfilms was resultantly able to produce two minutes of film per day  ten times as much as a conventional animation studio  with Postgate moving the cardboard pieces himself  and working his 16mm camera frame by frame with a home made clicker  As Postgate wholly voiced many of the productions  including the WereBear story tapes  his distinctive voice became familiar to generations of children   They started in 1959 with Ivor the Engine  a series for ITV about a Welsh steam locomotive who wanted to sing in a choir  Based on Postgate s wartime encounter with Welshman Denzyl Ellis  who used to be the fireman on the Royal Scot  it was remade in colour for the BBC in the 1970s  This was followed by Noggin the Nog for the BBC  which established Smallfilms as a safe and reliable pair of hands to produce children s entertainment  in the days when the number of UK television channels was restricted   In 2000 Postgate and his friend Loaf set up a small publishing company called the Dragons Friendly Society to look after Noggin the Nog  Pogles Wood  Pingwings   After Postgate s death in December 2008 Smallfilms was inherited by his son Daniel Postgate  Also  Universal took the distribution rights to the works of Smallfilms  Any such agreement does not include the materials Oliver published with The Dragons Friendly Society   In 2014 Postgate s son Daniel was working with Peter Firmin on a remake of the Clangers   3  Series development and philosophy  Postgate and Firmin recognised that their product was not to be sold to or bought by children  but by the commissioning television executives  Postgate described in a later interview the then  gentlemanly and rather innocent  business of programme commissioning thus   Postgate had strict views on storyline development  which perhaps resultantly restricted the length of each particular series development  When asked if the Clangers adventures were quite surreal sometimes  Postgate replied   The Smallfilms system was reliant on the company s only two employees 舑 Postgate and Firmin 舑 and was devoid of the modern considerations and essentials  as Postgate pointed out   excused the interference of educationalists  sociologists and other pseudo scientists  which produces eventually a confection of formulae which have no integrity  No  the mainspring of what we did was because it was fun    Recognising their commissioning audience  Smallfilms purposefully developed storylines which were engaging for both adults and children  While the storylines and production were remembered by children  the adult jokes like those about the Welsh in Ivor the Engine  or the fact that the Clangers swore occasionally  gave them both an instant parent engagement as well as a later revival with children who had grown up and were re watching their favourite programmes   4  Coolabi  In October 2008  production company Coolabi acquired the merchandising and distribution rights until 2013 to a number of the Smallfilms productions  Coolabi planned to introduce Bagpuss to a new generation  the company said there was  significant potential to build on the affection in which this classic brand is held    5  Productions  Alexander The Mouse  1958   The Journey Of Master Ho  1958   Ivor the
