The term phonation has slightly different meanings depending on the subfield of phonetics  Among some phoneticians  phonation is the process by which the vocal folds produce certain sounds through quasi periodic vibration  This is the definition used among those who study laryngeal anatomy and physiology and speech production in general  Phoneticians in other subfields  such as linguistic phonetics  call this process voicing  and use the term phonation to refer to any oscillatory state of any part of the larynx that modifies the airstream  of which voicing is just one example  Voiceless and supra glottal phonations are included under this definition   1  Voicing  The phonatory process  or voicing  occurs when air is expelled from the lungs through the glottis  creating a pressure drop across the larynx  When this drop becomes sufficiently large  the vocal folds start to oscillate  The minimum pressure drop required to achieve phonation is called the phonation threshold pressure  and for humans with normal vocal folds  it is approximately 2–3 cm H2O  The motion of the vocal folds during oscillation is mostly lateral  though there is also some superior component as well  However  there is almost no motion along the length of the vocal folds  The oscillation of the vocal folds serves to modulate the pressure and flow of the air through the larynx  and this modulated airflow is the main component of the sound of most voiced phones   The sound that the larynx produces is a harmonic series  In other words  it consists of a fundamental tone  called the fundamental frequency  the main acoustic cue for the percept pitch  accompanied by harmonic overtones  which are multiples of the fundamental frequency  The human instrument  Principles of Voice Production  Prentice Hall  currently published by NCVS org  According to the Source Filter Theory  the resulting sound excites the resonance chamber that is the vocal tract to produce the individual speech sounds   The vocal folds will not oscillate if they are not sufficiently close to one another  are not under sufficient tension or under too much tension  or if the pressure drop across the larynx is not sufficiently large  In linguistics  a phone is called voiceless if there is no phonation during its occurrence  In speech  voiceless phones are associated with vocal folds that are elongated  highly tensed  and placed laterally  abducted  when compared to vocal folds during phonation   Fundamental frequency  the main acoustic cue for the percept pitch  can be varied through a variety of means  Large scale changes are accomplished by increasing the tension in the vocal folds through contraction of the cricothyroid muscle  Smaller changes in tension can be effected by contraction of the thyroarytenoid muscle or changes in the relative position of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages  as may occur when the larynx is lowered or raised  either volitionally or through movement of the tongue to which the larynx is attached via the hyoid bone  In addition to tension changes  fundamental frequency is also affected by the pressure drop across the larynx  which is mostly affected by the pressure in the lungs  and will also vary with the distance between the vocal folds  Variation in fundamental frequency is used linguistically to produce intonation and tone   There are currently two main theories as to how vibration of the vocal folds is initiated  the myoelastic theory and the aerodynamic theory  These two theories are not in contention with one another and it is quite possible that both theories are true and operating simultaneously to initiate and maintain vibration  A third theory  the neurochronaxic theory  was in considerable vogue in the 1950s  but has since been largely discredited   1 1  Myoelastic and aerodynamic theory  The myoelastic theory states that when the vocal cords are brought together and breath pressure is applied to them  the cords remain closed until the pressure beneath them—the subglottic pressure—is sufficient to push them apart  allowing air to escape and reducing the pressure enough for the muscle tension recoil to pull the folds back together again  Pressure builds up once again until the cords are pushed apart  and the whole cycle keeps repeating itself  The rate at which the cords open and close—the number of cycles per second—determines the pitch of the phonation   The aerodynamic theory is based on the Bernoulli energy law in fluids  The theory states that when a stream of breath is flowing through the glottis while the arytenoid cartilages are held together by the action of the interarytenoid muscles  a push pull effect is created on the vocal fold tissues that maintains self sustained oscillation  The push occurs during glottal closing  when the glottis is convergent  whereas the pull occurs during glottal opening  when the glottis is divergent  During glottal closure  the air flow is cut off until breath pressure pushes the folds apart and the flow starts up again  causing the cycles to repeat  The textbook entitled Myoelastic Aerodynamic Theory of Phonation by Ingo Titze credits Janwillem van den Berg as the originator of the theory and provides detailed mathematical development of the theory   1 2  Neurochronaxic theory  This theory states that the frequency of the vocal fold vibration is determined by the chronaxy of the recurrent nerve  and not by breath pressure or muscular tension  Advocates of this theory thought that every single vibration of the vocal folds was due to an impulse from the recurrent laryngeal nerves and that the acoustic center in the brain regulated the speed of vocal fold vibration  Speech and voice scientists have long since left this theory as the muscles have been shown to not be able to contract fast enough to accomplish the vibration  In addition  persons with paralyzed vocal folds can produce phonation  which would not be possible according to this theory  Phonation occurring in excised larynges would also not be possible according to this theory   2  State of the glottis  In linguistic phonetic treatments of phonation  such as those of Peter Ladefoged  phonation was considered to be a matter of points on a continuum of tension and closure of the vocal cords  More intricate mechanisms were occasionally described  but they were difficult to investigate  and until recently the state of the glottis and phonation were considered to be nearly synonymous   If the vocal cords are completely relaxed  with the arytenoid cartilages apart for maximum airflow  the cords do not vibrate  This is voiceless phonation  and is extremely common with obstruents  If the arytenoids are pressed together for glottal closure  the vocal cords block the airstream  producing stop sounds such as the glottal stop  In between there is a sweet spot of maximum vibration  This is modal voice  and is the normal state for vowels and sonorants in all the world s languages  However  the aperture of the arytenoid cartilages  and therefore the tension in the vocal cords  is one of degree between the end points of open and closed  and there are several intermediate situations utilized by various languages to make contrasting sounds   For example  Gujarati has vowels with a partially lax phonation called breathy voice or murmured  while Burmese has vowels with a partially tense phonation called creaky voice or laryngealized  Both of these phonations have dedicated IPA diacritics  an under umlaut and under tilde  The Jalapa dialect of Mazatec is unusual in contrasting both with modal voice in a three way distinction   Note that Mazatec is a tonal language  so the glottis is making several tonal distinctions simultaneously with the phonation distinctions    Javanese does not have modal voice in its stops  but contrasts two other points along the phonation scale  with more moderate departures from modal voice  called slack voice and stiff voice  The  muddy  consonants in Shanghainese are slack voice  they contrast with tenuis and aspirated consonants   Although each language may be somewhat different  it is convenient to classify these degrees of phonation into discrete categories  A series of seven alveolar stops  with phonations ranging from an open lax to a closed tense glottis  are   The IPA diacritics under ring and subscript wedge  commonly called  voiceless  and  voiced   are sometimes added to the symbol for a voiced sound to indicate more lax open  slack  and tense closed  stiff  states of the glottis  respectively   Ironically  adding the  voicing  diacritic to the symbol for a voiced consonant indicates less modal voicing  not more  because a modally voiced sound is already fully voiced  at its sweet spot  and any further tension in the vocal cords dampens their vibration    Alsatian  like several Germanic languages  has a typologically unusual phonation in its stops  The consonants transcribed  ambiguously called  lenis   are partially voiced  The vocal cords are positioned as for voicing  but do not actually vibrate  That is  they are technically voiceless  but without the open glottis usually associated with voiceless stops  They contrast with both modally voiced and modally voiceless in French borrowings  as well as aspirated word initially   2 1  Glottal consonants  It has long been noted that in many languages  both phonologically and historically  the glottal consonants do not behave like other consonants  Phonetically  they have no manner or place of articulation other than the state of the glottis  glottal closure for   breathy voice for   and open airstream for   Some phoneticians have described these sounds as neither glottal nor consonantal  but instead as instances of pure phonation  at least in many European languages  However  in Semitic languages they do appear to be true glottal consonants   3  Supra glottal phonation  In the last few decades it has become apparent that phonation may involve the entire larynx  with as many as six valves and muscles working either independently or together  From the glottis upward  these articulations are   glottal  the vocal cords   producing the distinctions described above  ventricular  the  false vocal cords   partially covering and damping the glottis   arytenoid  sphincteric compression forwards and upwards   epiglotto pharyngeal  retraction of the tongue and epiglottis  potentially closing onto the pharyngeal wall   raising or lowering of the entire larynx  narrowing of the pharynx Until the development of fiber optic laryngoscopy  the full involvement of the larynx during speech production was not observable  and the interactions among the six laryngeal articulators is still poorly understood  However  at least two supra glottal phonations appear to be widespread in the world s languages  These are harsh voice   ventricular  or  pressed  voice   which involves overall constriction of the larynx  and faucalized voice   hollow  or  yawny  voice   which involves overall expansion of the larynx   The Bor dialect of Dinka has contrastive modal  breathy  faucalized  and harsh voice in its vowels  as well as three tones  The ad hoc diacritics employed in the literature are a subscript double quotation mark for faucalized voice    and underlining for harsh voice    Examples are   Other languages with these contrasts are Bai  modal  breathy  and harsh voice   Kabiye  faucalized and harsh voice  previously seen as ±ATR   Somali  breathy and harsh voice    Elements of laryngeal articulation or phonation may occur widely in the world s languages as phonetic detail even when not phonemically contrastive  For example  simultaneous glottal  ventricular  and arytenoid activity  for something other than epiglottal consonants  has been observed in Tibetan  Korean  Nuuchahnulth  Nlaka pamux  Thai  Sui  Amis  Pame  Arabic  Tigrinya  Cantonese  and Yi   4  Familiar language examples  In languages such as French  all obstruents occur in pairs  one modally voiced and one voiceless   In English  every voiced fricative corresponds to a voiceless one  For the pairs of English stops  however  the distinction is better specified as voice onset time rather than simply voice  In initial position  b d g  are only partially voiced  voicing begins during the hold of the consonant   while  p t k  are aspirated  voicing doesn t begin until well after its release   Certain English morphemes have voiced and voiceless allomorphs  such as the plural  verbal  and possessive endings spelled  s  voiced in kids but voiceless in kits   and the past tense ending spelled  ed  voiced in buzzed but voiceless in fished    A few European languages  such as Finnish  have no phonemically voiced obstruents but pairs of long and short consonants instead  Outside of Europe  a lack of voicing distinctions is not uncommon  indeed  in Australian languages it is nearly universal  In languages without the distinction between voiceless and voiced obstruents  it is often found that they are realized as voiced in voiced environments such as between vowels  and voiceless elsewhere   5  Vocal registers  5 1  Phonology  In phonology  a register is a combination of tone and vowel phonation into a single phonological parameter  For example  among its vowels  Burmese combines modal voice with low tone  breathy voice with falling tone  creaky voice with high tone  and glottal closure with high tone  These four registers contrast with each other  but no other combination of phonation  modal  breath  creak  closed  and tone  high  low  falling  is found   5 2  Pedagogy and speech pathology  Among vocal pedagogues and speech pathologists  a vocal register also refers to a particular phonation limited to a particular range of pitch  which possesses a characteristic sound quality  The term  register  may be used for several distinct aspects of the human voice   A particular part of the vocal range  such as the upper  middle  or lower registers  which may be bounded by vocal breaks  A particular phonation  A resonance area such as chest voice or head voice  A certain vocal timbre Four combinations of these elements are identified in speech pathology  the vocal fry register  the modal register  the falsetto register  and the whistle register   6  See also  List of phonetics topics  Breathy voice  Slack voice  Stiff voice  Creaky voice  Harsh voice  Strident vowel  Faucalized voice  Voice onset time  Voice organ  Vocal
