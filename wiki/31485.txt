Thomas Jonathan  Stonewall  Jackson  January 21  1824 – May 10  1863  was a Confederate general during the American Civil War  and the best known Confederate commander after General Robert E  Lee  His military career includes the Valley Campaign of 1862 and his service as a corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E  Lee  Confederate pickets accidentally shot him at the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 2  1863  The general survived with the loss of an arm to amputation  but died of complications from pneumonia eight days later  His death was a severe setback for the Confederacy  affecting not only its military prospects  but also the morale of its army and of the general public  Jackson in death became an icon of Southern heroism and commitment  becoming a mainstay in the pantheon of the  Lost Cause    Military historians consider Jackson to be one of the most gifted tactical commanders in U S  history  His Valley Campaign and his envelopment of the Union Army right wing at Chancellorsville are studied worldwide even today as examples of innovative and bold leadership  He excelled as well in other battles  the First Battle of Bull Run  First Manassas  where he received his famous nickname  Stonewall   Second Bull Run  Second Manassas   Antietam  and Fredericksburg  Jackson was not universally successful as a commander  however  as displayed by his weak and confused efforts during the Seven Days Battles around Richmond in 1862   1  Early life  1 1  Paternal ancestry  Thomas Jonathan Jackson was the great grandson of John Jackson  1715 or 1719 – 1801  and Elizabeth Cummins  also known as Elizabeth Comings and Elizabeth Needles   1723–1828   John Jackson was a Protestant  Ulster Scottish  from Coleraine  County Londonderry  Ireland  While living in London  England  he was convicted of the capital crime of larceny for stealing £170  the judge at the Old Bailey sentenced him to a seven year indenture in America  Elizabeth  a strong  blonde woman over tall  born in London  England was also convicted of larceny in an unrelated case for stealing 19 pieces of silver  jewelry  and fine lace  and received a similar sentence  They both were transported on the prison ship Litchfield  which departed London in May 1749 with 150 convicts  John and Elizabeth met on board and were in love by the time the ship arrived at Annapolis  Maryland  Although they were sent to different locations in Maryland for their indentures  the couple married in July 1755   The family migrated west across the Blue Ridge Mountains to settle near Moorefield  Virginia   now West Virginia  in 1758  In 1770  they moved farther west to the Tygart Valley  They began to acquire large parcels of virgin farming land near the present day town of Buckhannon  including 3 000 acres  12 km²  in Elizabeth s name  John  and his two teenage sons  were early recruits for the American Revolutionary War  fighting in the Battle of Kings Mountain on October 7  1780  John finished the war as captain and served as a lieutenant of the Virginia Militia after 1787  While the men were in the Army  Elizabeth converted their home to a haven   Jackson s Fort   for refugees from Indian attacks   John and Elizabeth had eight children  Their second son was Edward Jackson  March 1  1759 – December 25  1828   and Edward s third son was Jonathan Jackson  Thomas s father   1 2  Early childhood  Thomas Jackson was the third child of Julia Beckwith  née Neale  Jackson  1798–1831  and Jonathan Jackson  1790–1826   an attorney  Both of Jackson s parents were natives of Virginia  The family already had two young children and were living in Clarksburg  in what is now West Virginia  when Thomas was born  He was named for his maternal grandfather  There is some dispute about the actual location of Jackson s birth  A historical marker on the floodwall in Parkersburg  West Virginia  claims that he was born in a cabin near that spot when his mother was visiting her parents who lived there  It is said that in Jackson s early childhood  he has been known to be called  The Real Macaroni   It is a common legend and myth of how Jackson had ever achieved the nickname   Thomas s sister Elizabeth  age six  died of typhoid fever on March 6  1826  with two year old Thomas at her bedside  His father also died of a typhoid fever on March 26  Jackson s mother gave birth to Thomas s sister Laura Ann the day after Jackson s father died  Julia Jackson thus was widowed at 28 and was left with much debt and three young children  including the newborn   She sold the family s possessions to pay the debts  She declined family charity and moved into a small rented one room house  Julia took in sewing and taught school to support herself and her three young children for about four years   In 1830  Julia Neale Jackson remarried  Her new husband  Blake Woodson  an attorney  did not like his stepchildren  There were continuing financial problems  The following year  after giving birth to Thomas s half brother  Julia died of complications  leaving her three older children orphaned  Julia was buried in an unmarked grave in a homemade coffin in Westlake Cemetery along the James River and Kanawha Turnpike in Fayette County within the corporate limits of present day Ansted  West Virginia   1 3  Working and teaching at Jackson s Mill  As their mother s health continued to fail  Jackson and his sister Laura Ann were sent to live with their uncle  Cummins Jackson  who owned a grist mill in Jackson s Mill  near present day Weston in Lewis County in central West Virginia   Their older brother  Warren  went to live with other relatives on his mother s side of the family  but he later died of tuberculosis in 1841 at the age of 20  Thomas and Laura Ann returned from Jackson s Mill in November 1831 to be at their dying mother s bedside  They spent four years together at the Mill before being separated—Laura Ann was sent to live with her mother s family  Thomas to live with his Aunt Polly  his father s sister  and her husband  Isaac Brake  on a farm 4 miles from Clarksburg  Thomas was treated by Brake as an outsider and  having suffered verbal abuse for over a year  ran away from the family  When his cousin in Clarksburg besought him to return to Aunt Polly s  he replied   Maybe I ought to  ma am  but I am not going to   He walked 18 miles through mountain wilderness to Jackson s Mill  where he was welcomed by his uncles and he remained there for the following seven years   Cummins Jackson was strict with Thomas  who looked up to Cummins as a schoolteacher  Jackson helped around the farm  tending sheep with the assistance of a sheepdog  driving teams of oxen and helping harvest wheat and corn  Formal education was not easily obtained  but he attended school when and where he could  Much of Jackson s education was self taught  He once made a deal with one of his uncle s slaves to provide him with pine knots in exchange for reading lessons  Thomas would stay up at night reading borrowed books by the light of those burning pine knots  Virginia law forbade teaching a slave  free black or mulatto to read or write  as enacted following Nat Turner s Slave Rebellion in Southampton County in 1831  Nevertheless  Jackson secretly taught the slave to write  as he had promised  Once literate  the young slave fled to Canada via the underground railroad  In his later years at Jackson s Mill  Thomas was a schoolteacher   1 4  Brother against sister  The Civil War has sometimes been referred to as a war of  brother against brother   but in the case of the Jackson family  it was brother against sister  Laura Jackson Arnold was close to her brother Thomas until the Civil War period  As the war loomed  she became a staunch Unionist in a somewhat divided Harrison County  She was so strident in her beliefs that she expressed mixed feelings upon hearing of Thomas s death  One Union officer said that  though she seemed depressed at hearing the news  her Unionism was stronger than her family bonds  In a letter  he wrote that Laura had said she  would rather know that he was dead than to have him a leader in the rebel army   Her Union sentiment also estranged her later from her husband  Jonathan Arnold   2  Early military career  2 1  West Point  In 1842  Jackson was accepted to the United States Military Academy at West Point  New York  Because of his inadequate schooling  he had difficulty with the entrance examinations and began his studies at the bottom of his class  Displaying a dogged determination that was to characterize his life  however  he became one of the hardest working cadets in the academy  and moved steadily up the academic rankings  Jackson graduated 17th out of 59 students in the Class of 1846  It was said by his peers that if he had stayed there another year  he would have graduated first   2 2  U S  Army and the Mexican War  Jackson began his United States Army career as a second lieutenant in the 1st U S  Artillery Regiment and was sent to fight in the Mexican–American War from 1846 to 1848  He served at the Siege of Veracruz and the battles of Contreras  Chapultepec  and Mexico City  eventually earning two brevet promotions  and the regular army rank of first lieutenant  It was in Mexico that Thomas Jackson first met Robert E  Lee   During the assault on Chapultepec Castle  he refused what he felt was a  bad order  to withdraw his troops  Confronted by his superior  he explained his rationale  claiming withdrawal was more hazardous than continuing his overmatched artillery duel  His judgment proved correct  and a relieving brigade was able to exploit the advantage Jackson had broached  In contrast to this display of strength of character  he obeyed what he also felt was a  bad order  when he raked a civilian throng with artillery fire after the Mexican authorities failed to surrender Mexico City at the hour demanded by the U S  forces  The former episode  and later aggressive action against the retreating Mexican army  earned him field promotion to the brevet rank of major  September 13  1847    After the war  Thomas Jackson was briefly assigned to forts in New York  and then to Florida during the Second Interbellum of the Seminole Wars  during which the Americans were attempting to force the remaining Seminoles in Florida to move West  He was stationed briefly at Fort Casey before being named second in command at Fort Meade  a small fort about 30 miles south of Tampa  His commanding officer was Major William H  French  Jackson and French disagreed often  and filed numerous complaints against each other  Jackson stayed in Florida less than a year   3  Lexington and the Virginia Military Institute  In the spring of 1851  Jackson accepted a newly created teaching position at the Virginia Military Institute  VMI   in Lexington  Virginia  He became Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Instructor of Artillery  Parts of Jackson s curriculum are still taught at VMI  regarded as timeless military essentials  discipline  mobility  assessing the enemy s strength and intentions while attempting to conceal your own  and the efficiency of artillery combined with an infantry assault   Despite the high quality of his work – he spent a great deal of time preparing in depth for each class meeting – Jackson was unpopular as a teacher  His students called him  Tom Fool   He memorized his lectures and then recited them to the class  any student who came to ask for help was given the same explanation as before  And if a student asked for help a second time  Jackson viewed him as insubordinate and punished him  The students mocked his apparently stern  religious nature and his eccentric traits  In 1856  a group of alumni attempted to have Jackson removed from his position   Jackson s peculiar personal traits contributed to his unpopularity as an educator  With little sense of humor  he once tried to get a cadet dismissed from VMI for playing a prank on him  He was a hypochondriac who had sinus problems and arthritis and stood for long periods of time to keep his internal organs in place  a tiring activity that he believed contributed to good health  He rarely ate much food and often subsisted on crackers and milk  He required little sleep but was known to take catnaps  He liked mineral baths   Little as he was known to the white inhabitants of Lexington  Jackson was revered by many of the African Americans in town  both slaves and free blacks  He was instrumental in the organization in 1855 of Sunday School classes for blacks at the Presbyterian Church  His second wife  Mary Anna Jackson  taught with Jackson  as  he preferred that my labors should be given to the colored children  believing that it was more important and useful to put the strong hand of the Gospel under the ignorant African race  to lift them up   The pastor  Dr  William Spottswood White  described the relationship between Jackson and his Sunday afternoon students   In their religious instruction he succeeded wonderfully  His discipline was systematic and firm  but very kind      His servants reverenced and loved him  as they would have done a brother or father      He was emphatically the black man s friend   He addressed his students by name and they  in turn  referred to him affectionately as  Marse Major    Jackson s family owned six slaves in the late 1850s  Three  Hetty  Cyrus  and George  a mother and two teenage sons  were received as a wedding present  Another  Albert  requested that Jackson purchase him and allow him to work for his freedom  he was employed as a waiter in one of the Lexington hotels and Jackson rented him to VMI  Amy also requested that Jackson purchase her from a public auction and she served the family as a cook and housekeeper  The sixth  Emma  was a four year old orphan with a learning disability  accepted by Jackson from an aged widow and presented to his second wife  Mary Anna  as a welcome home gift  After the American Civil War began he appears to have hired out or sold his slaves  Mary Anna Jackson  in her 1895 memoir  said   our servants     without the firm guidance and restraint of their master  the excitement of the times proved so demoralizing to them that he deemed it best for me to provide them with good homes among the permanent residents   James Robertson wrote about Jackson s view on slavery   While an instructor at VMI in 1853  Thomas Jackson married Elinor  Ellie  Junkin  whose father  George Junkin  was president of Washington College  later named Washington and Lee University  in Lexington  An addition was built onto the president s residence for the Jacksons  and when Robert E  Lee became president of Washington College he lived in the same home  now known as the Lee–Jackson House  Ellie gave birth to a stillborn son on October 22  1854  experiencing a hemorrhage an hour later that proved fatal   After a tour of Europe  Jackson married again  in 1857  Mary Anna Morrison was from North Carolina  where her father was the first president of Davidson College  They had a daughter named Mary Graham on April 30  1858  but the baby died less than a month later  Another daughter was born in 1862  shortly before her father s death  The Jacksons named her Julia Laura  after his mother and sister   Jackson purchased the only house he ever owned while in Lexington  Built in 1801  the brick town house at 8 East Washington Street was purchased by Jackson in 1859  He lived in it for two years before being called to serve in the Confederacy  Jackson never returned to his home   In November 1859  at the request of the governor of Virginia  Major William Gilham led a contingent of the VMI Cadet Corps to Charles Town to provide an additional military presence at the hanging of militant abolitionist John Brown on December 2  following his raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry on October 16  Major Jackson was placed in command of the artillery  consisting of two howitzers manned by 21 cadets   4  Civil War  In 1861  as the American Civil War broke out  Jackson became a drill master for some of the many new recruits in the Confederate Army  On April 27  1861  Virginia Governor John Letcher ordered Colonel Jackson to take command at Harpers Ferry  where he would assemble and command the famous  Stonewall Brigade   consisting of the 2nd  4th  5th  27th  and 33rd Virginia Infantry regiments  All of these units were from the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia  where Jackson located his headquarters throughout the first two years of the war  Jackson became known for his relentless drilling of his troops  he believed discipline was vital to success on the battlefield  Following raids on the B&O Railroad on May 24  he was promoted to brigadier general on June 17   4 1  First Bull Run  Jackson rose to prominence and earned his most famous nickname at the First Battle of Bull Run  First Manassas  on July 21  1861  As the Confederate lines began to crumble under heavy Union assault  Jackson s brigade provided crucial reinforcements on Henry House Hill  demonstrating the discipline he instilled in his men  Brig  Gen  Barnard Elliott Bee  Jr   exhorted his own troops to re form by shouting   There is Jackson standing like a stone wall  Let us determine to die here  and we will conquer  Rally behind the Virginians   There is some controversy over Bee s statement and intent  which could not be clarified because he was killed almost immediately after speaking and none of his subordinate officers wrote reports of the battle  Major Burnett Rhett  chief of staff to General Joseph E  Johnston  claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson s failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee s and Bartow s brigades while they were under heavy pressure  Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee s statement was meant to be pejorative   Look at Jackson standing there like a damned stone wall   Regardless of the controversy and the delay in relieving Bee  Jackson s brigade  which would thenceforth be known as the Stonewall Brigade  stopped the Union assault and suffered more casualties than any other Southern brigade that day  Jackson has since then been generally known as Stonewall Jackson  During the battle  Jackson displayed a gesture common to him and held his left arm skyward with the palm facing forward – interpreted by his soldiers variously as an eccentricity or an entreaty to God for success in combat  His hand was struck by a bullet or a piece of shrapnel and he suffered a small loss of bone in his middle finger  He refused medical advice to have the finger amputated  After the battle  Jackson was promoted to major general  October 7  1861  and given command of the Valley District  with headquarters in Winchester   4 2  Valley Campaign  In the spring of 1862  Union Maj  Gen  George B  McClellan s Army of the Potomac approached Richmond from the southeast in the Peninsula Campaign  Maj  Gen  Irvin McDowell s large corps were poised to hit Richmond from the north  and Maj  Gen  Nathaniel P  Banks s army threatened the Shenandoah Valley  Jackson was ordered by Richmond to operate in the Valley to defeat Banks  threat and prevent McDowell s troops from reinforcing McClellan   Jackson possessed the attributes to succeed against his poorly coordinated and sometimes timid opponents  a combination of great audacity  excellent knowledge and shrewd use of the terrain  and the ability to inspire his troops to great feats of marching and fighting   The campaign started with a tactical defeat at Kernstown on March 23  1862  when faulty intelligence led him to believe he was attacking a small detachment  But it became a strategic victory for the Confederacy  because his aggressiveness suggested that he possessed a much larger force  convincing President Abraham Lincoln to keep Banks  troops in the Valley and McDowell s 30 000 man corps near Fredericksburg  subtracting about 50 000 soldiers from McClellan s invasion force  As it transpired  it was Jackson s only defeat in the Valley   By adding Maj  Gen  Richard S  Ewell s large division and Maj  Gen  Edward  Allegheny  Johnson s small division  Jackson increased his army to 17 000 men  He was still significantly outnumbered  but attacked portions of his divided enemy individually at McDowell  defeating both Brig  Gens  Robert H  Milroy and Robert C  Schenck  He defeated Banks at Front Royal and Winchester  ejecting him from the Valley  Lincoln decided that the defeat of Jackson was an immediate priority  though Jackson s orders were solely to keep Union forces occupied away from Richmond   He ordered Irvin McDowell to send 20 000 men to Front Royal and Maj  Gen  John C  Frémont to move to Harrisonburg  If both forces could converge at Strasburg  Jackson s only escape route up the Valley would be cut   After a series of maneuvers  Jackson defeated Frémont s command at Cross Keys and Brig  Gen  James Shields at Port Republic on June 8–9  Union forces were withdrawn from the Valley   It was a classic military campaign of surprise and maneuver  Jackson pressed his army to travel in 48 days of marching and won five significant victories with a force of about 17 000 against a combined force of 60 000  Stonewall Jackson s reputation for moving his troops so rapidly earned them the oxymoronic nickname  foot cavalry   He became the most celebrated soldier in the Confederacy  until he was eventually eclipsed by Lee  and lifted the morale of the Southern public   4 3  Peninsula  McClellan s Peninsula Campaign toward Richmond stalled at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31 and June 1  After the Valley Campaign ended in mid June  Jackson and his troops were called to join Robert E  Lee s Army of Northern Virginia in defense of the capital  By utilizing a railroad tunnel under the Blue Ridge Mountains and then transporting troops to Hanover County on the Virginia Central Railroad  Jackson and his forces made a surprise appearance in front of McClellan at Mechanicsville  Reports had last placed Jackson s forces in the Shenandoah Valley  their presence near Richmond added greatly to the Union commander s overestimation of the strength and numbers of the forces before him  This proved a crucial factor in McClellan s decision to re establish his base at a point many miles downstream from Richmond on the James River at Harrison s Landing  essentially a retreat that ended the Peninsula Campaign and prolonged the war almost three more years   Jackson s troops served well under Lee in the series of battles known as the Seven Days Battles  but Jackson s own performance in those battles is generally considered to be poor  He arrived late at Mechanicsville and inexplicably ordered his men to bivouac for the night within clear earshot of the battle  He was late and disoriented at Gaines  Mill  He was late again at Savage s Station and at White Oak Swamp he failed to employ fording places to cross White Oak Swamp Creek  attempting for hours to rebuild a bridge  which limited his involvement to an ineffectual artillery duel and a missed opportunity  At Malvern Hill Jackson participated in the futile  piecemeal frontal assaults against entrenched Union infantry and massed artillery  and suffered heavy casualties  but this was a problem for all of Lee s army in that ill considered battle   The reasons for Jackson s sluggish and poorly coordinated actions during the Seven Days are disputed  although a severe lack of sleep after the grueling march and railroad trip from the Shenandoah Valley was probably a significant factor  Both Jackson and his troops were completely exhausted  It has also been said by Longstreet that   General Jackson never showed his genius when under the immediate command of General Lee    4 4  Second Bull Run to Fredericksburg  The military reputations of Lee s corps commanders are often characterized as Stonewall Jackson representing the audacious  offensive component of Lee s army  whereas his counterpart  James Longstreet  more typically advocated and executed defensive strategies and tactics  Jackson has been described as the army s hammer  Longstreet its anvil  In the Northern Virginia Campaign of August 1862 this stereotype did not hold true  Longstreet commanded the Right Wing  later to become known as the First Corps  and Jackson commanded the Left Wing  Jackson started the campaign under Lee s orders with a sweeping flanking maneuver that placed his corps into the rear of Union Maj  Gen  John Pope s Army of Virginia  At Manassas Junction  Jackson was able to capture all of the supplies of the Union Army depot  Then he had his troops destroy all of it  for it was the main depot for the Union Army  Jackson then retreated and then took up a defensive position and effectively invited Pope to assault him  On August 28–29  the start of the Second Battle of Bull Run  Second Manassas   Pope launched repeated assaults against Jackson as Longstreet and the remainder of the army marched north to reach the battlefield   On August 30  Pope came to believe that Jackson was starting to retreat  and Longstreet took advantage of this by launching a massive assault on the Union army s left with over 25 000 men  Although the Union troops put up a furious defense  Pope s army was forced to retreat in a manner similar to the embarrassing Union defeat at First Bull Run  fought on roughly the same battleground   When Lee decided to invade the North in the Maryland Campaign  Jackson took Harpers Ferry  then hastened to join the rest of the army at Sharpsburg  Maryland  where they fought McClellan in the Battle of Antietam  Sharpsburg   Antietam was primarily a defensive battle against superior odds  although McClellan failed to exploit his advantage  Jackson s men bore the brunt of the initial attacks on the northern end of the battlefield and  at the end of the day  successfully resisted a breakthrough on the southern end when Jackson s subordinate  Maj  Gen  A P  Hill  arrived at the last minute from Harpers Ferry  The Confederate forces held their position  but the battle was extremely bloody for both sides  and Lee withdrew the Army of Northern Virginia back across the Potomac River  ending the invasion  Jackson was promoted to lieutenant general  being ranked just behind Lee and Longstreet  On October 10 his command was redesignated the Second Corps   Before the armies camped for winter  Jackson s Second Corps held off a strong Union assault against the right flank of the Confederate line at the Battle of Fredericksburg  in what became a decisive Confederate victory  Just before the battle  Jackson was delighted to receive a letter about the birth of his daughter  Julia Laura Jackson  on November 23  Also before the battle  Maj  Gen  J E B  Stuart  Lee s dashing and well dressed cavalry commander  presented to Jackson a fine general s frock coat that he had ordered from one of the best tailors in Richmond  Jackson s previous coat was threadbare and colorless from exposure to the elements  its buttons removed by admiring ladies  Jackson asked his staff to thank Stuart  saying that although the coat was too handsome for him  he would cherish it as a souvenir  His staff insisted that he wear it to dinner  which caused scores of soldiers to rush to see him in uncharacteristic garb  So embarrassed was Jackson with the attention that he did not wear the new uniform for months   4 5  Chancellorsville  At the Battle of Chancellorsville  the Army of Northern Virginia was faced with a serious threat by the Army of the Potomac and its new commanding general  Major General Joseph Hooker  General Lee decided to employ a risky tactic to take the initiative and offensive away from Hooker s new southern thrust—he decided to divide his forces  Jackson and his entire corps were sent on an aggressive flanking maneuver to the right of the Union lines  This flanking movement would be one of the most successful and dramatic of the war  While riding with his infantry in a wide berth well south and west of the Federal line of battle  Jackson employed Maj  Gen  Fitzhugh Lee s cavalry to provide for better reconnaissance in regards to the exact location of the Union right and rear  The results were far better than even Jackson could have hoped  Fitzhugh Lee found the entire right side of the Federal lines in the middle of open field  guarded merely by two guns that faced westward  as well as the supplies and rear encampments  The men were eating and playing games in carefree fashion  completely unaware that an entire Confederate corps was less than a mile away  What happened next is given in Fitzhugh Lee s own words   Jackson immediately returned to his corps and arranged his divisions into a line of battle to charge directly into the oblivious Federal right  The Confederates marched silently until they were merely several hundred feet from the Union position  then released a bloodthirsty cry and full charge  Many of the Federals were captured without a shot fired  the rest were driven into a full rout  Jackson pursued relentlessly back toward the center of the Federal line until dusk   Darkness ended the assault  As Jackson and his staff were returning to camp on May 2  they were mistaken for a Union cavalry force by the 18th North Carolina Infantry regiment who shouted   Halt  who goes there    but fired before evaluating the reply  Frantic shouts by Jackson s staff identifying the party were replied to by Major John D  Barry with the retort   It s a damned Yankee trick  Fire   A second volley was fired in response  in all  Jackson was hit by three bullets  two in the left arm and one in the right hand  Several other men in his staff were killed  in addition to many horses  Darkness and confusion prevented Jackson from getting immediate care  He was dropped from his stretcher while being evacuated because of incoming artillery rounds  Because of his injuries  Jackson s left arm had to be amputated by Dr  Hunter McGuire  Jackson was moved to Thomas C  Chandler s plantation named Fairfield  He was offered Chandler s home for recovery  but Jackson refused and suggested using Chandler s plantation office building instead  He was thought to be out of harm s way  but unknown to the doctors  he already had classic symptoms of pneumonia  complaining of a sore chest  This soreness was mistakenly thought to be the result of his rough handling in the battlefield evacuation   5  Death  Lee wrote to Jackson after learning of his injuries  stating  Could I have directed events  I would have chosen for the good of the country to be disabled in your stead   Jackson died of complications from pneumonia on May 10  1863  On his death bed  though he became weaker  he remained spiritually strong  saying towards the end  It is the Lord s Day  my wish is fulfilled  I have always desired to die on Sunday   Dr  McGuire wrote an account of his final hours and his last words   His body was moved to the Governor s Mansion in Richmond for the public to mourn  and he was then moved to be buried in the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery  Lexington  Virginia  However  the arm that was amputated on May 2 was buried separately by Jackson s chaplain  at the J  Horace Lacy house   Ellwood   in the Wilderness of Orange County  near the field hospital   Upon hearing of Jackson s death  Robert E  Lee mourned the loss of both a friend and a trusted commander  As Jackson lay dying  Lee sent a message through Chaplain Lacy  saying  Give General Jackson my affectionate regards  and say to him  he has lost his left arm but I my right   The night Lee learned of Jackson s death  he told his cook   William  I have lost my right arm  and  I m bleeding at the heart    Harpers Weekly reported Jackson s death on May 23  1863  as follows   6  Legacy  Jackson s sometimes unusual command style and personality traits  combined with his frequent success in battle  contribute to his legacy as one of the most remarkable generals of the Civil War  Although martial  stern in attitude  he was profoundly religious and a deacon in the Presbyterian Church  One of his many nicknames was  Old Blue Lights   a term applied to a military man whose evangelical zeal burned with the intensity of the blue light used for night time display  He disliked fighting on Sunday  although that did not stop him from doing so after much personal debate  He loved his wife very much and sent her tender letters  In direct contrast to Lee  Jackson was not a striking figure  often wearing old  worn out clothes rather than a fancy uniform   6 1  Physical ailments  Jackson held a lifelong belief that one of his arms was longer than the other  and thus usually held the  longer  arm up to equalize his circulation  He was described as a  champion sleeper   even falling asleep with food in his mouth occasionally  A paper delivered to the Society of Clinical Psychologists hypothesized that Jackson had Asperger syndrome  although other possible explanations  such as a herniated diaphragm  exist  Indeed Jackson suffered a number of ailments  for which he sought relief via contemporary practices of his day including hydrotherapy  popular in America at that time  visiting establishments at Oswego  New York  1850  and Round Hill  Massachusetts  1860  although with little evidence of success  Jackson also suffered a significant hearing loss in both of his ears as a result of his prior service in the U S  Army as an artillery officer   A recurring story concerns Jackson s love of lemons  which he allegedly gnawed whole to alleviate symptoms of dyspepsia  General Richard Taylor  son of President Zachary Taylor  wrote a passage in his war memoirs about Jackson eating lemons   Where Jackson got his lemons  no fellow could find out   but he was rarely without one   However  recent research by his biographer  James I  Robertson  Jr   has found that none of his contemporaries  including members of his staff  friends  or his wife  recorded any unusual obsessions with lemons and Jackson thought of a lemon as a  rare treat     enjoyed greatly whenever it could be obtained from the enemy s camp   Jackson was fond of all fruits  particularly peaches   but he enjoyed with relish lemons  oranges  watermelons  apples  grapes  berries  or whatever was available    6 2  Religion  Jackson s religion has often been discussed  His biographer  Robert Lewis Dabney  suggested that  It was the fear of God which made him so fearless of all else   Jackson himself had said   My religious belief teaches me to feel as safe in battle as in bed    Stephen W  Sears suggests that  Jackson was fanatical in his Presbyterian faith  and it energized his military thought and character  Theology was the only subject he genuinely enjoyed discussing  His dispatches invariably credited an ever kind Providence   However  according to Sears   this fanatical religiosity had drawbacks  It warped Jackson s judgment of men  leading to poor appointments  it was said he preferred good Presbyterians to good soldiers   James I  Robertson  Jr  suggests that Jackson was  a Christian soldier in every sense of the word   According to Robertson  Jackson  thought of the war as a religious crusade   and  viewed himself as an Old Testament warrior – like David or Joshua – who went into battle to slay the Philistines    Jackson encouraged the Confederate States Army revival that occurred in 1863  although it was probably more of a grass roots movement than a top down revival  Jackson strictly observed the Sunday Sabbath  James I  Robertson  Jr  notes that  no place existed in his Sunday schedule for labor  newspapers  or secular conversation    6 3  Command style  In command  Jackson was extremely secretive about his plans and extremely meticulous about military discipline  This secretive nature did not stand him in good stead with his subordinates  who were often not aware of his overall operational intentions until the last minute  and who complained of being left out of key decisions   Robert E  Lee could trust Jackson with deliberately non detailed orders that conveyed Lee s overall objectives  what modern doctrine calls the  end state   This was because Jackson had a talent for understanding Lee s sometimes unstated goals and Lee trusted Jackson with the ability to take whatever actions were necessary to implement his end state requirements  Few of Lee s subsequent corps commanders had this ability  At Gettysburg  this resulted in lost opportunities  Thus  after the Federals retreated to the heights south of town  Lee sent one of his new corps commanders  Richard S  Ewell  discretionary orders that the heights  Cemetery Hill and Culp s Hill  be taken  if practicable   Without Jackson s intuitive grasp of Lee s orders or the instinct to take advantage of sudden tactical opportunities  Ewell chose not to attempt the assault  and this failure is considered by historians to be the greatest missed opportunity of the battle   6 4  Horsemanship  Jackson had a poor reputation as a horseman  One of his soldiers  Georgia volunteer William Andrews  wrote that Jackson was  a very ordinary looking man of medium size  his uniform badly soiled as though it had seen hard service  He wore a cap pulled down nearly to his nose and was riding a rawboned horse that did not look much like a charger  unless it would be on hay or clover  He certainly made a poor figure on a horseback  with his stirrup leather six inches too short  putting his knees nearly level with his horse s back  and his heels turned out with his toes sticking behind his horse s foreshoulder  A sorry description of our most famous general  but a correct one   His horse was named  Little Sorrel   also known as  Old Sorrel    a small chestnut gelding which ironically was a captured Union horse from a Connecticut farm  He rode Little Sorrel throughout the war  and was riding him when he was shot at Chancellorsville  Little Sorrel died at age 36 and is buried near a statue of Jackson on the parade grounds of VMI   His mounted hide is on display in the VMI Museum    6 5  Mourning his death  Jackson was greatly admired and respected throughout the South  and his death had a profound effect there on civilians and soldiers alike  A poem penned by one of his soldiers soon became a very popular song   Stonewall Jackson s Way   Many theorists through the years have postulated that if Jackson had lived  Lee might have prevailed at Gettysburg  Certainly Jackson s discipline and tactical sense were sorely missed   6 6  Remembering Jackson  After the war  Jackson s wife and young daughter Julia moved from Lexington to North Carolina  Mary Anna Jackson wrote two books about her husband s life  including some of his letters  She never remarried  and was known as the  Widow of the Confederacy   living until 1915  His daughter Julia married  and bore children  but she died of typhoid fever at the age of 26 years   A former Confederate soldier who admired Jackson  Captain Thomas R  Ranson of Staunton  Virginia  also remembered the tragic life of Jackson s mother  Years after the War  he went to the tiny mountain hamlet of Ansted in Fayette County  West Virginia  and had a marble marker placed over the unmarked grave of Julia Neale Jackson in Westlake Cemetery  to make sure that the site was not lost forever   6 7  Commemorations  West Virginia s Stonewall Jackson State Park is named in his honor  Nearby  at Stonewall Jackson s historical childhood home  his uncle s grist mill is the centerpiece of a historical site at the Jackson s Mill Center for Lifelong Learning and State 4 H Camp  The facility  located near Weston  serves as a special campus for West Virginia University and the WVU Extension Service   He is memorialized on historic Monument Avenue in Richmond  Virginia  on the grounds of the state capitol in his native West Virginia  and in many other places  The Thomas Jonathan Jackson Sculpture was erected at Charlottesville  Virginia in 1921  and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997   At VMI  a bronze statue of Jackson stands outside the main entrance to the cadet barracks  first year cadets exiting the barracks through that archway are required to honor Jackson s memory by saluting the statue   Jackson has been commemorated on U S  postage stamps on three occasions  the first being a commemorative stamp that also honored Robert E  Lee  issued in 1936  the second in 1970  along with Lee again and Jefferson Davis  depicted on horseback on the 6 cent Stone Mountain Memorial commemorative issue  modeled after the actual Stone Mountain Memorial carving in Georgia  The stamp was issued on September 19  1970 in conjunction with the dedication of the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial in Georgia on May 9  1970  A third stamp commemorating Jackson was released in 1995  copyrighted stamp not shown    The lineage of Jackson s Confederate Army unit  the Stonewall Brigade  continues to the present day in form of the 116th Infantry Brigade of the U S  Army  currently part of the Virginia National Guard  The unit s shoulder sleeve insignia worn until 2008 depicted Stonewall Jackson mounted on horseback   The United States Navy submarine U S S  Stonewall Jackson  SSBN 634   commissioned in 1964  was named for him  The words  Strength—Mobility  are emblazoned on the ship s banner  words taken from letters written by General Jackson  It was the third U S  Navy ship named for him  The submarine was decommissioned in 1995  During World War II  the Navy named a Liberty ship the SS T J  Jackson in his honor   The U S  M36 tank destroyer was nicknamed Jackson after him by British forces in World War II   The Commonwealth of Virginia honors Jackson s birthday on Lee Jackson Day  a state holiday observed as such since 1904  It is currently observed on the Friday preceding the third Monday in January   Jackson also appears prominently in the enormous bas relief carving on the face of Stone Mountain riding with Jefferson Davis and Robert E  Lee  The carving depicts the three on horseback  appearing to ride in a group from right to left across the mountainside  The lower parts of the horses  bodies merge into the mountainside at the foot of the carving  The three riders are shown bare headed and holding their hats to their chests  It is the largest such carving in the world    Stonewall  Jackson appeared on the CSA $500 bill  7th Issue  February 17  1864    The towns of Stonewall in Virginia  North Carolina  Alabama  Mississippi  Louisiana  Oklahoma  Texas and Kentucky are named in his honor as are Jackson County in Oklahoma and Stonewall County in Texas   During a training exercise in Virginia by U S  Marines in 1921  the Marine commander  General Smedley Butler was told by a local farmer that Stonewall Jackson s arm was buried nearby under a granite marker  to which Butler replied   Bosh  I will take a squad of Marines and dig up that spot to prove you wrong   Butler found the arm in a box under the marker  He later replaced the wooden box with a metal one  and reburied the arm  He left a plaque on the granite monument marking the burial place of Jackson s arm  the plaque is no longer on the marker but can be viewed at the Chancellorsville Battlefield visitor s center   6 8  In popular media  Jackson is featured prominently in the novel and film Gods and Generals  In the film  he is portrayed by Stephen Lang   The Theater at Lime Kiln  a local outdoor theater company in Lexington  Virginia  has performed a country style musical about the life and times of Stonewall Jackson entitled Stonewall Country since 1984   In the 2012 film Abraham Lincoln vs  Zombies  Jackson is portrayed by Don McGraw as one of the heroes of the story  giving his life to save Lincoln and the rest of the surviving team   John Dwyer s historical novel Stonewall covers Jackson s entire life  from childhood to death  with particular attention paid to the role his Presbyterian faith played in his life   Stonewall Jackson has appeared in a number of alternative history novels  He is the subject of Douglas Lee Gibboney s short novel Stonewall Jackson at Gettysburg  which dwells on Jackson s presence on the outcome of the Gettysburg Campaign  Jackson also appears in Harry Turtledove s How Few Remain  where Jackson leads the main army of an independent Confederacy in an 1881 war against the United States  Stonewall Jackson is the protagonist of Stonewall Goes West by R E  Thomas  where Jackson survives his wounding at Chancellorsville to replace Braxton Bragg at the head of the Army of Tennessee   The ghost of Stonewall Jackson makes an appearance in the 2013 film Anchorman 2  The Legend Continues  played by John C  Reilly   In the movie Patton  U S  General George S  Patton is referred to as  the greatest general since Stonewall Jackson  because of his military maneuvers in Palermo  Sicily   7  Quotations  8  See also  William B  Ebbert  1st Lt   W  Virginia Infantry  Union
