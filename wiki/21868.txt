Neutronium  sometimes shortened to neutrium  is a proposed name for a substance composed purely of neutrons  The word was coined by scientist Andreas von Antropoff in 1926  before the discovery of the neutron  for the conjectured  element of atomic number zero  that he placed at the head of the periodic table  However  the meaning of the term has changed over time  and from the last half of the 20th century onward it has been also used legitimately to refer to extremely dense substances resembling the neutron degenerate matter theorized to exist in the cores of neutron stars  henceforth  degenerate neutronium  will refer to this  Science fiction and popular literature frequently use the term  neutronium  to refer to a highly dense phase of matter composed primarily of neutrons   1  Neutronium and neutron stars  Neutronium is used in popular literature to refer to the material present in the cores of neutron stars  stars which are too massive to be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and which collapse into a denser phase of matter   This term is very rarely used in scientific literature  for three reasons   There are multiple definitions for the term  neutronium    There is considerable uncertainty over the composition of the material in the cores of neutron stars  it could be neutron degenerate matter  strange matter  quark matter  or a variant or combination of the above    The properties of neutron star material should depend on depth due to changing pressure  see below   and no sharp boundary between the crust  consisting primarily of atomic nuclei  and almost protonless inner layer is expected to exist  When neutron star core material is presumed to consist mostly of free neutrons  it is typically referred to as neutron degenerate matter in scientific literature   2  Neutronium and the periodic table  The term  neutronium  was coined in 1926 by Andreas von Antropoff for a conjectured form of matter made up of neutrons with no protons or electrons  which he placed as the chemical element of atomic number zero at the head of his new version of the periodic table  It was subsequently placed in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements  such as those of Charles Janet  1928   E  I  Emerson  1944   John D  Clark  1950  and in Philip Stewart s Chemical Galaxy  2005    Although the term is not used in the scientific literature either for a condensed form of matter  or as an element  there have been reports that  besides the free neutron  there may exist two bound forms of neutrons without protons  If neutronium were considered to be an element  then these neutron clusters could be considered to be the isotopes of that element  However  these reports have not been further substantiated  Further information can be found in the following articles   Mononeutron  Isolated neutrons undergo beta decay with a mean lifetime of approximately 15 minutes  half life of approximately 10 minutes   becoming protons  the nucleus of hydrogen   electrons and antineutrinos   Dineutron  The dineutron  containing two neutrons was unambiguously observed in the decay of beryllium 16  in 2012 by researchers at Michigan State University  It is not a bound particle  but had been proposed as an extremely short lived state produced by nuclear reactions involving tritium  It has been suggested to have a transitory existence in nuclear reactions produced by helions that result in the formation of a proton and a nucleus having the same atomic number as the target nucleus but a mass number two units greater  There had been evidence of dineutron emission from neutron rich isotopes such as beryllium 16 where mononeutron decay would result in a less stable isotope  The dineutron hypothesis had been used in nuclear reactions with exotic nuclei for a long time  Several applications of the dineutron in nuclear reactions can be found in review papers  Its existence has been proven to be relevant for nuclear structure of exotic nuclei  A system made up of only two neutrons is not bound  though the attraction between them is very nearly enough to make them so  This has some consequences on nucleosynthesis and the abundance of the chemical elements   Trineutron  A trineutron state consisting of three bound neutrons has not been detected  and is not expected to exist even for a short time   Tetraneutron  A tetraneutron is a hypothetical particle consisting of four bound neutrons  Reports of its existence have not been replicated  If confirmed  it would require revision of current nuclear models   Pentaneutron  Calculations indicate that the hypothetical pentaneutron state  consisting of a cluster of five neutrons  would not be bound  Although not called  neutronium   the National Nuclear Data Center s Nuclear Wallet Cards lists as its first  isotope  an  element  with the symbol n and atomic number Z   0 and mass number A   1  This isotope is described as decaying to element H with a half life of    3  Properties  Due to beta  β−  decay of mononeutron and extreme instability of aforementioned heavier  isotopes   degenerate neutronium is not expected to be stable under ordinary pressures  Free neutrons decay with a half life of 10 minutes  11 seconds  A teaspoon of degenerate neutronium gas would have a mass of two billion tonnes  and if moved to standard temperature and pressure  would emit 57 billion joules of β− decay energy in the first half life  average of 95 MW of power   This energy may be absorbed as the neutronium gas expands  Though  in the presence of atomic matter compressed to the state of electron degeneracy  the β− decay may be inhibited due to Pauli exclusion principle  thus making free neutrons stable  Also  elevated pressures should make neutrons degenerate themselves  Compared to ordinary elements  neutronium should be more compressible due to the absence of electrically charged protons and electrons  This makes neutronium more energetically favorable than  positive Z  atomic nuclei and leads to their conversion to  degenerate  neutronium through electron capture  a process which is believed to occur in stellar cores in the final seconds of the lifetime of massive stars  where it is facilitated by cooling via emission  As a result  degenerate neutronium can have a density of   roughly 13 magnitudes denser than the densest known ordinary substances  It was theorized that extreme pressures may deform the neutrons into a cubic symmetry  allowing tighter packing of neutrons  or cause a strange matter formation   4  In fiction  The term  neutronium  has been popular in science fiction since at least the middle of the 20th century  It typically refers to an extremely dense  incredibly strong form of matter  While presumably inspired by the concept of neutron degenerate matter in the cores of neutron stars  the material used in fiction bears at most only a superficial resemblance  usually depicted as an extremely strong solid under Earth like conditions  or possessing exotic properties such as the ability to manipulate time and space  In contrast  all proposed forms of neutron star core material are fluids and are extremely unstable at pressures lower than that found in stellar cores  According to one analysis  a neutron star with a mass below about 0 2 solar masses will explode   Noteworthy appearances of neutronium in fiction include the following   In Hal Clement s short story Proof  1942   neutronium is the only form of solid matter known to Solarians  the inhabitants of the Sun s interior   In Vladimir Savchenko s Black Stars  1960   neutronium is a mechanically and thermally indestructible substance  It is also used to make antimatter  which leads to an annihilation accident   In Doctor Who  1963   neutronium is a substance which can shield spaces from time shear when used as shielding in time vessels   In Larry Niven s Known Space fictional universe  1964   neutronium is actual neutron star core material  but it is stable in smaller quantities   In the Star Trek universe  neutronium is an extremely hard and durable substance  often used as armor  which conventional weapons cannot penetrate or even dent  The substance is referred to in the storyline dialogue of  The Doomsday Machine    A Piece of the Action    Evolution    Relics    To the Death    What You Leave Behind    Phage    Prey   and  Think Tank    In Peter F  Hamilton s novel The Neutronium Alchemist  1997   neutronium is created by the  aggressive  setting off of a superweapon   In the Stargate universe  neutronium is a substance which is the basis of the technology of the advanced Asgard race  as well as a primary component of human form Replicators   In Greg Bear s The Forge of God  1987   alien aggressors inject two high mass weapons made of neutronium and antineutronium into the Earth which orbit the Earth s core until they meet and annihilate  destroying the planet   Action Comics #376  May  1969    The Only Way to Kill Superman  has Superman flying into a white dwarf star to grab a couple of handfuls of neutronium to fashion earplugs that will protect his ears from a hypersonic blast  In the panel on page seven  he states that each handful weighs a million tons   5  See also  Compact star  6  References  7  Further reading  pt
