Paraffin wax is a white or colorless soft solid derivable from petroleum  coal or oil shale  that consists of a mixture of hydrocarbon molecules containing between twenty and forty carbon atoms  It is solid at room temperature and begins to melt above approximately   its boiling point is    Common applications for paraffin wax include lubrication  electrical insulation  and candles  It is distinct from kerosene  another petroleum product that is sometimes called paraffin   In chemistry  paraffin is used synonymously with alkane  indicating hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n+2  The name is derived from Latin parum   barely   + affinis  meaning  lacking affinity  or  lacking reactivity   referring to paraffin s unreactive nature   1  Properties  Paraffin wax is mostly found as a white  odorless  tasteless  waxy solid  with a typical melting point between about   and a density of around 900 kg m3  It is insoluble in water  but soluble in ether  benzene  and certain esters  Paraffin is unaffected by most common chemical reagents but burns readily  Its heat of combustion is 42 kJ g   Paraffin wax is an excellent electrical insulator  with a resistivity of between 1013 and 1017 ohm metre  This is better than nearly all other materials except some plastics  notably Teflon   It is an effective neutron moderator and was used in James Chadwick s 1932 experiments to identify the neutron   Paraffin wax is an excellent material for storing heat  with a specific heat capacity of 2 14–2 9 J g−1 K−1  joules per gram kelvin  and a heat of fusion of 200–220 J g−1  This property is exploited in modified drywall for home building material  a certain type of wax  with the right melting point  is infused in the drywall during manufacture so that it melts during the day  absorbing heat  and solidifies again at night  releasing the heat  Paraffin wax phase change cooling coupled with retractable radiators was used to cool the electronics of the Lunar Rover  Wax expands considerably when it melts and this allows its use in wax thermostatic element thermostats for industrial  domestic and  particularly  automobile purposes   2  Manufacturing  The feedstock for paraffin is slack wax  which is a mixture of oil and wax  a byproduct from the refining of lubricating oil   The first step in making paraffin wax is to remove the oil  de oiling or de waxing  from the slack wax  The oil is separated through crystallization  Most commonly  the slack wax is heated  mixed with one or more solvents such as a ketone and then cooled  As it is cooled  wax crystallizes out leaving oil in solution  This mixture is filtered into two streams  solid  wax plus some solvent  and liquid  oil and solvent   After the solvent is recovered by distillation  the resulting products are called  product wax   or  press wax   and  foots oil   The lower the percentage of oil in the wax the more refined it is considered  semi refined versus fully refined   The product wax may be further processed to remove colors and odors  The wax may finally be blended together to give certain desired properties such as melt point and penetration  Paraffin wax is sold in either liquid or solid form   3  Applications  In industrial applications  it is often useful to modify the crystal properties of the paraffin wax  typically by adding branching to the existing carbon backbone chain  The modification is usually done with additives  such as EVA copolymers  microcrystalline wax  or forms of polyethylene  The branched properties result in a modified paraffin with a higher viscosity  smaller crystalline structure  and modified functional properties  Pure paraffin wax is rarely used for carving original models for casting metal and other materials in the lost wax process  as it is relatively brittle at room temperature and presents the risks of chipping and breakage when worked  Soft and pliable waxes  like beeswax  may be preferred for such sculpture  but  investment casting waxes   often paraffin based  are expressly formulated for the purpose   In a pathology laboratory  paraffin wax is used to impregnate tissue prior to sectioning thin samples of tissue  Water is removed from tissue through ascending strengths of alcohol  75% to absolute  and the tissue is cleared in an organic solvent such as xylene  The tissue is then placed in paraffin wax for a number of hours and then set in a mold with wax to cool and solidify  sections are cut then on a microtome   3 1  Other uses  Candle making  Coatings for waxed paper or cloth  Food grade

suspect  Antiozonant agents  blends of paraffin and micro waxes are used in rubber compounds to prevent cracking of the rubber  the admixture of wax migrates to the surface of the product and forms a protective layer  The layer can also act as a release agent  helping the product separate from its mould   Mechanical thermostats and actuators  as an expansion medium for activating such devices
