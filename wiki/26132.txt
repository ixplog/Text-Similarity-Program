Rankine    is a thermodynamic  absolute  temperature scale named after the Glasgow University engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine  who proposed it in 1859   The Kelvin scale was first proposed in 1848    The symbol for degrees Rankine is °R  or °Ra if necessary to distinguish it from the Rømer and Réaumur scales   By analogy with Kelvin  some authors call the unit rankine  omitting the degree symbol  Zero on both the Kelvin and Rankine scales is absolute zero  but the Rankine degree is defined as equal to one degree Fahrenheit  rather than the one degree Celsius used by the Kelvin scale  A temperature of −459 67 °F is exactly equal to 0 °R   Some engineering fields in the United States measure thermodynamic temperature using the Rankine scale  The US National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends not using degrees Rankine in NIST publications   Some key temperatures relating the Rankine scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below   1  Conversion table between the temperature units  2  See also  Comparison of temperature scales  3  Notes and references  4  External links
