The Royal Institute of Technology    abbreviated KTH  is a university in Stockholm  Sweden  KTH was founded in 1827 as Sweden s first polytechnic and is one of Scandinavia s largest  the largest by certain definitions  institutions of higher education in technology  KTH accounts for one third of Sweden s technical research and engineering education capacity at university level  KTH offers programmes leading to a Master of Architecture  Master of Science in Engineering  Bachelor of Science in Engineering  Bachelor of Science  Master of Science  licentiate or doctoral degree  The university also offers a technical preparatory programme for non scientists and further education   There are a total of just over 14 000 full year equivalent undergraduate students  more than 1700 active postgraduate students and 4600 full time equivalent employees  KTH is one of the leading technical universities in Europe and highly respected worldwide  especially in the domains of technology and natural sciences   1  Campuses  1 1  Main Campus  The main campus buildings at Valhallavägen in Östermalm  by architect Erik Lallerstedt  were completed in 1917  The buildings and surroundings were decorated by prominent early 20th century Swedish artists such as Carl Milles  Axel Törneman  Georg Pauli  Tore Strindberg and Ivar Johnsson  The older buildings on the campus went through a complete renovation in 1994  While the original campus was large for its time  KTH very soon outgrew it and the campus was expanded with new buildings  Today KTH institutions and faculties are distributed across several campuses in Stockholm County  located in Flemingsberg  Haninge  Kista and Södertälje in addition to the ones in Östermalm   1 2  Kista  The Kista Campus is located in Kista  Stockholm  housing the ICT department of the university  With companies such as Ericsson  Volvo  IBM  Tele2  TietoEnator  Microsoft  Intel and Oracle as neighbors  the cooperation between industry and KTH is widely known  Stockholm University’s computer science programmes are also located in Kista   1 3  Flemingsberg  School of Technology and Health  has a part of its activities in Flemingsberg  At KTH Flemingsberg the school offer courses in Medical Engineering and conduct research within the subject   KTH s activities in Flemingsberg started in 2002  Since 2003  the school offers a Bachelor of Education in Medical engineering  in collaboration with the Karolinska Institutet  In the autumn of 2008 a master of science in medical engineering started  Beside the undergraduate studies mostly of the research departments is located here and also the research center  Center for Technology  medicine and health  CTMH  in which we collaborate with Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm County Council  SLL  for the purpose of contribute to the development and growth of research in engineering  medicine and health   Flemingsberg is an area of high academic  density  and one of northern Europe s most important areas within biotechnology – both terms of research and industrial activities  Here are also Södertörn University and the Karolinska Institute with over 10 000 students and Novum Research Center  where 1000 people are involved in research   Flemingsberg is an area of strong growth  To meet the need for student housing is planned and built more apartments   1 4  Haninge  In Haninge  students from two schools at KTH receive education – the School of Architecture and the Built Environment  ABE  and the School of Technology and Health  STH  Here  students study at undergraduate and master level in fields such as building engineering  ABE   computer engineering  electrical engineering and foundation training  The School of Technology and Health also has a research centre i Haninge – Centre for Health and Building   Just south of metropolitan Stockholm you will discover a modern campus with reputation for its nice campus area  safe atmosphere and the feeling of togetherness among staff and students   KTH Haninge holds a large number of courses  For example  the international master programme Architectural Lighting Design is located here  with students from over 20 different countries   KTH Haninge has a meeting point where the diverse worlds of culture  scientific research and business come together to experience and examine the significance of light and lighting in our daily lives  This is called the Lighting Laboratory   The campus itself is located near the commuter train  which takes you to Stockholm in just 20 minutes  It is also close to a beautiful archipelago and enjoy the great outdoors in Tyresta National Park   1 5  Södertälje  KTH Södertälje is Södertälje’s university college campus  KTH Södertälje is a moderately large area with close and natural contacts between teachers and students   KTH Södertälje’s education is being constantly developed via a close co operation with the town’s business community and in particular major Södertälje companies such as Scania and AstraZeneca  Among other things  university engineers in electronics and mechanical engineering are educated here  In addition  KTH also offer various Master s programmes in logistics  project management and product development   Since the autumn of 2007  the design studio Go Deep KTH at KTH Södertälje has been able to offer product development work via surveys  concept  visualisation and development through design  The idea with Go Deep KTH is to create realistic cooperation projects with companies  public administrations and institutions together with researchers in technology  medicine and health   At KTH Södertälje  each year Tegelnatten is arranged  a competition whereby students in teams solve a project assignment which lasts for a period of 24 hours  The project assignment for design night 2008 was to provide proposals and ideas as to how future games and competitions will be designed to attract and entice the future generations   Södertälje offers KTH s students who will be studying at KTH Södertälje a guaranteed apartment in Södertälje  Students who live and study in Södertälje also receive a computer via cooperation with the municipality which they are able to use during the period of time they spend as a student   2  History  KTH was founded in 1827 under the name Technological Institute  Teknologiska institutet   following the establishment of polytechnical schools in many European countries the early years of the 19th century  often based on the model of École Polytechnique in Paris in 1794   KTH s earliest Swedish predecessor was the Laboratorium mechanicum  a collection of mechanical models for teaching created in 1697 by Christopher Polhem  who is considered to be the father of mechanics in Sweden  The models were used intermittently for teaching practical mechanics by different masters until the School of Mechanics  Mekaniska skolan  was founded in 1798  This is the year from which there has been continuous teaching of technology in Sweden  The activities of the School of Mechanics was taken over by KTH when it was founded   The institute had one professor of chemistry and one of physics  and one class in mechanical engineering and one in chemical engineering  During the first years  however  teaching was at a very elementary level  and more aimed at craftsmanship rather than engineering as such  The institute was also plagued by conflicts between the faculty and the founder and head of the institute  Gustaf Magnus Schwartz  who was responsible for the artisanal focus of the institute  A governmental committee was appointed in 1844 to solve the issues  which led to the removal of Schwartz in 1845  Instead  Joachim Åkerman  the head of the School of Mining in Falun and a former professor of chemistry at KTH  took over  He led a complete reorganisation of the institute in 1846–1848  after which he returned to his post in Falun  An entrance test and a minimum age of 16 for students was introduced  which led to the creation of a proper engineering training at the institute  In 1851  the course was extended from two to three years   In the late 1850s  the institute entered a period of expansion  In 1863 the institute received its own purpose built buildings on Drottninggatan  In 1867 the regulations of the institute were again overhauled  and now explicitly stated that the institute should provide scientific training to its students  In 1869  the School of Mining in Falun was moved to Stockholm and merged with the institute  and in 1871 the institute took over the civil engineering course previously arranged by the Higher Artillery College in Marieberg   In 1877 the name was changed into the current one  which changed KTH s status from Institute  institut  to College  högskola   and some courses were extended from three to four years  Architecture was also added to the course programme   In 1915  the degree titles conferred by KTH received legal protection  In the late 19th century  it had become common to use the title civilingenjör  literally  civil engineer   for most KTH trained engineers  and not just those who studied building and construction related subjects  The only exception was the mining engineers  which called themselves bergsingenjör   mountain engineer    For a while  the title civilingenjör was equal to  KTH graduate  but in 1937  Chalmers in Gothenburg became the second Swedish engineering college which were allowed to confirm these titles   In 1917  the first buildings of KTH s new campus on Valhallavägen were completed  and still constitute its main campus   Although the engineering education of the late 19th and early 20th century were scientifically founded  up until the early 20th century  research as such was not seen as a central activity of an Institute of Technology  Those engineering graduates which went on to academic research had to earn their doctorates  typically in physics or chemistry  at a regular university  In 1927  KTH was finally granted the right to confer its own doctorates  under the designation Teknologie doktor  Doctor of Technology   and the first five doctors were created in 1929   In 1984 the civilingenjör course at all Swedish universities was extended from four to 4 5 years  From 1989  the shorter training in technology arranged by the municipal polytechnical schools in Sweden was gradually extended and moved into the university system  from 1989 as two year courses and from 1995 alternatively as three year courses  For KTH  this meant that additional campuses around the Stockholm area were added   In present day KTH continue to be Sweden s largest  oldest  and most international technical university  The university provides one third of Sweden s research and engineering education  In 2012  there were a total of 14 000 undergraduate students  1 700 postgraduate students  and 4 600 members of staff at the university   2 1  R1 nuclear reactor  After the American deployment of nuclear weapons at the end of World War II  the Swedish military leadership recognized the need for nuclear weapons to be thoroughly investigated and researched to provide Sweden with the knowledge to defend itself from a nuclear attack  With the mission to  make something with neutrons   the Swedish team  with scientists like Rolf Maximilian Sievert  set out to research the subject and eventually build a nuclear reactor for testing   After a few years of basic research  they started building a 300 kW  later expanded to 1 MW  reactor  named Reaktor 1  R1 for short  in a reactor hall 25 meters under the surface right underneath KTH  Today this might seem ill considered  since approximately 40 000 people lived within a 1 km radius  It was risky  but was deemed tolerable since the reactor was an important research tool for scientists at the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences  Ingenjörsvetenskapsakademien    At 18 59 on 13 July 1954  the reactor reached critical mass and sustained Sweden s first nuclear reaction  R1 was to be the main site for almost all Swedish nuclear research until 1970 when the reactor was finally decommissioned  mostly due to the increased awareness of the risks associated with operating a reactor in a densely populated area of Stockholm  The reactor hall remains an amusement to many as once it was next door to what used to be Sweden s first nuclear reactor  Close to the reactor hall is the restaurant Q   3  Organization  From 2005 KTH is organized into nine schools each consisting of a number of departments   School of Architecture and the Built Environment  ABE   Real Estate and Construction Management  Philosophy and History of Science  Technology and Environment

five highest quality education areas among all universities and colleges in Sweden  The Royal Institute of Technology received one such  Centre of Excellent Quality in Higher Education   in Vehicle Engineering   It is the only higher education institution in the Stockholm Uppsala region to receive an award  In 2009  KTH was the only institution among all Sweden s universities to be awarded Centre of Excellent Quality in Higher Education  in computer science   In 2014 2015 the university was ranked 110th in the world by QS World University Rankings  and it was ranked 33rd in the world for engineering and technology  making it the highest ranked institution in Scandinavia  and 74th in the natural sciences  The 2013 14 Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked KTH 117th in the world  KTH is ranked as the 34th best university worldwide in the field of engineering and technology  It is also 13th among the world’s technical universities  and 6th among Europe’s   5
