Washington Dulles International Airport is a public airport in Dulles  Virginia  26 miles  42 km  west of downtown Washington  D C  The airport serves the Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area  centered on the District of Columbia  The airport is named after John Foster Dulles  the 52nd Secretary of State and served under President Dwight D  Eisenhower  The Dulles main terminal is a well known landmark designed by Eero Saarinen  Operated by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority  Dulles Airport occupies straddling the border of Fairfax County and Loudoun County  Virginia  within the unincorporated communities of Chantilly and Dulles   Dulles is the busiest airport in the Washington metropolitan area  and second busiest airport in the larger Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area  after BWI Airport  with over 22 million passengers a year  With nearly all of the international passenger traffic in the Washington Baltimore region  Dulles is the busiest international airport in the Mid Atlantic outside of the New York metropolitan area  On a typical day  more than 60 000 passengers pass through Washington Dulles to and from more than 125 destinations around the world  Dulles is the sixth largest hub for United Airlines and an East Coast focus city for Frontier Airlines   1  History  1 1  Origins  At the end of World War II  the growth in aviation in the Washington metropolitan area led Congress to pass the Washington Airport Act of 1950  Congress  through legislation  was recognizing that the planned future longer range and larger aircraft  as well as the increased number of projected landings takeoffs  were far beyond the capacity of the existing airports in the Washington  DC area of the time  This reality supported providing federal backing for a second airport  After preliminary proposals failed  including one to establish an international airport at what is now Burke Lake Park  the current site was selected by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958  As a result of the selection  the unincorporated community of Willard  which once stood in the airport s current footprint  was demolished   1 2  Design and original construction  The civil engineering firm Ammann and Whitney was named lead contractor  The airport was dedicated by President John F  Kennedy on November 17  1962  As originally opened  the airport had three runways  current day runways 1L 19R  1C 19C  and 12 30   Its original name  Dulles International Airport  was changed in 1984 to Washington Dulles International Airport  The main terminal was designed in 1958 by famed Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen and it is highly regarded for its graceful beauty  suggestive of flight  In the 1990s  the main terminal at Dulles was reconfigured to allow more space between the front of the building and the ticket counters  Additions at both ends of the main terminal more than doubled the structure s length  The original terminal at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in Taoyuan  Taiwan was modeled after the Saarinen terminal at Dulles   The design included a landscaped man made lake to collect rainwater  a low rise hotel  and a row of office buildings along the north side of the main parking lot  The design also included a two level road in front of the terminal to separate arrival and departure traffic and a federally owned limited access highway connecting the terminal to the Capital Beltway  I 495  about to the east   Eventually  the highway system grew to include a parallel toll road to handle commuter traffic and an extension to connect to I 66   The access road had a wide median strip to allow the construction of a passenger rail line  which will be in the form of an extension of the Washington Metro and is expected to be completed in 2018   1 3  Notable operations and milestones  The first scheduled flight at Dulles was an Eastern Air Lines Super Electra turboprop from Newark International Airport in New Jersey on November 19  1962   Dulles was initially considered a white elephant  being far out of town with few flights  in 1965 Dulles averaged 89 airline operations a day while Reagan National Airport averaged 600 despite not allowing jets   Dulles got its first transatlantic nonstop in June 1964   Airport operations grew along with Virginia suburbs and the Dulles Technology Corridor  perimeter and slot restrictions at Washington National Airport forced long distance flights to use Dulles  In 1969 Dulles had 2 01 million passengers while National had 9 9 million   The era of jumbo jets began on January 15  1970 when First Lady Pat Nixon christened a Pan Am Boeing 747 at Dulles in the presence of Pan Am chairman Najeeb Halaby  Rather than a traditional champagne bottle  red  white  and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft  Pan Am s first Boeing 747 flight was Dulles to London Heathrow Airport   On May 24  1976 supersonic flights between Dulles and Europe began with the arrival of a British Airways Concorde from London and an Air France Concorde from Paris  The two were lined nose to nose at Dulles for photos   On June 12  1983 the Space Shuttle Enterprise arrived at Dulles mounted on top of a modified Boeing 747 after touring Europe and before returning to Edwards Air Force Base  Two years later Enterprise returned and was placed in a storage hangar near Runway 12 30 to await the construction of a planned expansion to the National Air and Space Museum  Enterprise left Dulles on April 27  2012  for its new home at the Intrepid Sea  Air & Space Museum in New York City   In 1990 a United States Senate joint resolution to change the name of Washington Dulles to Washington Eisenhower was proposed by Senator Bob Dole  but didn t pass   When the SR 71 was retired by the military in 1990  one was flown from its birthplace at United States Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale  California to Dulles  setting a coast to coast speed record at an average 2 124 mph  3 418 km h   The trip took 64 minutes  The aircraft was placed in a storage building to await display   The first flight of the Boeing 777 200 in commercial service  a United Airlines flight from London Heathrow  landed at Dulles in 1995   In December 2003 the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum officially opened the Steven F  Udvar Hazy Center at Dulles  The museum annex houses an Air France Concorde  the Enola Gay B 29  the Space Shuttle Discovery  the Boeing 367–80  which was the prototype of the Boeing 707  the SR 71  and other famous aerospace artifacts  particularly those too large for the main building on the National Mall   The 2004 launch of low cost carrier Independence Air propelled IAD from being the 24th busiest airport in the United States to fourth  and one of the top 30 busiest in the world  Independence Air ceased operations in January 2006  and its space in Concourse A was taken five months later by United Express   Southwest Airlines began service at Dulles in fall 2006  In 2007  24 7 million passengers passed through the airport   On November 20  2008  a third parallel north south runway was opened on the west side of the airfield  designated as 1R 19L  The original 1R 19L was redesignated 1C 19C  It was the first new runway to be built at Dulles since the airport s construction   On June 6  2011 Air France began Airbus A380 flights from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to Washington Dulles   On April 17  2012 the Space Shuttle Discovery was ferried to Dulles mounted to a NASA 747 100 as part of its decommissioning and installation in the Steven F  Udvar Hazy Center   On June 1  2012 the first passenger flight of the Boeing 747 8 Intercontinental landed as Lufthansa Flight 416 from Frankfurt Airport   On August 15  2012  Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner arrived at Dulles   On October 2  2014 British Airways began Airbus A380 flights from London Heathrow Airport to Washington Dulles   1 4  Planned development  By the 1980s  the original design  which had mobile lounges meet each plane  was no longer well suited to Dulles  role as a hub airport  Instead  midfield concourses were added to allow passengers to walk between connecting flights without visiting the main terminal  Mobile lounges were still used for international flights and to transport passengers between the midfield concourses and the main terminal  An underground tunnel  consisting of a passenger walkway and moving sidewalks  which links the main terminal and Concourse B was opened in 2004  The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority  MWAA  began a renovation program for the airport including a new security mezzanine with more room for lines   A new train system  dubbed AeroTrain and developed by Mitsubishi  began in 2010 to transport passengers between the concourses and the main terminal  The system  which uses rubber tires and travels along a fixed underground guideway  is similar to the people mover systems at Singapore Changi Airport  Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport  and Denver International Airport  The train is intended to replace the mobile lounges  which many passengers found crowded and inconvenient  The initial phase includes the main terminal station  a permanent Concourse A station  a permanent Concourse B station  a permanent midfield concourse station  with access to the current temporary C concourse via a tunnel with moving walkways   and a maintenance facility  Mobile lounges continue to service the D Concourse from both the main terminal and Concourse A  Even after AeroTrain is built out and the replacement Concourses C and D are built  the mobile lounges and plane mates will still continue to be used  to transport international arriving passengers to the International Arrivals Building  as well as transport passengers to aircraft parked on hardstands without direct access to jet bridges  Dulles has stated that the wait time for a train does not exceed four minutes  compared to the average 15 minute wait and travel time for mobile lounges   Under the development plan  future phases would see the addition of several new midfield concourses and a new south terminal  A fourth runway  parallel to the existing runways 1 and 19 L&R  opened in 2008  and development plans include a fifth runway to parallel the existing runway 12–30  If this runway is built  the current runway will be redesignated as 12L 30R while the new runway will be designated 12R 30L  An expansion of the B concourse  used by many low cost airlines as well as international arrivals  has been completed  and the building housing Concourses C and D will eventually be knocked down to make room for a more ergonomic building  Because Concourses C and D are temporary concourses  the only way to get to those concourses is via moving walkway from the Concourse C station which is built in the location of the future gates and Concourse D by mobile lounge from the main terminal   2  Statistics  United Airlines has used Dulles as a hub since 1985  Along with Newark Liberty International Airport  it is one of United s two transatlantic gateways with many nonstop flights to Europe and the Middle East  United handled 65 2% of scheduled air carrier passengers at the airport in 2013  JetBlue Airways handled 1 7% of scheduled air carrier passengers  American Airlines is the airport s third largest carrier in tickets sold and handled  4%  In addition  24 foreign carriers have service in and out of Washington Dulles  On a typical day  Dulles averages 1 000 to 1 200 flight operations  Dulles International served 22 6 million passengers in 2012  a 2 8% decrease over 2011  However  international passenger traffic has increased by 2 0% during the same time  Additional international service is commencing service at Washington Dulles  With 45 weekly flights  Dulles is now the second largest United States gateway to the Middle East  Even before the United States economic recession started  international passengers have continued to grow  which prompted the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to expand the International Arrivals Building to handle 2 400 passengers per hour   Notes  Includes US Airways  3  Terminals  The airport s terminal complex consists of a main terminal and two midfield terminal buildings  Concourses A B and C D  The entire terminal complex has 123 gates and 16 hardstand locations from which passengers can board or disembark using the airport s plane mate vehicles   Conceived in early planning sessions in 1959  Dulles is one of the few remaining airports to use the mobile lounge  also known as  plane mates  or  people movers   for boarding and disembarkation from aircraft  and to transfer passengers between the midfield concourses and to and from the main terminal building  They have all been given names based on the postal abbreviations of 50 states  e g   VA  MD  AK   The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has begun to gradually phase out the mobile lounge system for inter terminal passenger movements in favor of the AeroTrain  an underground people mover which currently operates to Concourses A  B and C  and underground pedestrian walkway tunnels  now in service to concourse A B   The mobile lounges are still used to transport passengers directly from the main terminal to Concourse D  Plane mates also remain in use to disembark international passengers and carry them to the International Arrivals Building  as well as to convey passengers to and from aircraft on hard stand  i e   those parked remotely on the apron without access to jet bridges    3 1  Main terminal  The iconic main terminal  which houses ticketing  baggage claim  U S  Customs and Border Protection  the Z gates  and other support facilities  was recognized by the American Institute of Architects in 1966 for its design concept  its roof is a suspended catenary providing a wide enclosed area unimpeded by any columns  It houses ticketing  baggage claim  and information facilities  as well as the International Arrivals Building for passenger processing   The main terminal was extended in 1996 to —Saarinen s original design length—which was slightly more than double its originally constructed length of   In addition  an extension for international arrivals was added to the west of the main terminal in 1991  On September 22  2009  an expansion of the international arrivals building opened which includes a arrival hall for customs and immigration processing  The new facility has the capacity to process 2 400 arriving passengers per hour   In September 2009  a central Transportation Security Administration checkpoint was added on a new security mezzanine level of the main terminal  This checkpoint replaced previous checkpoints located behind the ticketing areas  A separate security checkpoint is available on the baggage claim level  Both security checkpoints connect to the new AeroTrain  which links the main terminal with the A  B  and C concourses   There are two sets of gates in the main terminal  the first is the  H  Gates  which are waiting areas for airlines which lack permanent physical gates and therefore use plane mates to reach planes parked at 16 hard stand locations  The other is a set of four gates designated as Concourse Z  which provides service for Frontier Airlines and Silver Airways   3 2  Midfield terminals  There are two midfield terminal buildings at Dulles  one contains the A and B midfield concourses  the other the C and D midfield concourses   3 2 1  Concourses A and B  All non United flights operate out of these two concourses  Concourse A  which has 47 gates  composes the eastern part of the closer midfield terminal building  It consists of a permanent ground level set of gates designed for small planes such as regional jets and several former B concourse gates  The concourse is primarily used for international flights  Air France operates an airline lounge opposite gate A22  Ethiad Airways operates a First and Business Class lounge across from gate A15  Virgin Atlantic has a Clubhouse lounge across from gate A32  Concourse A s AeroTrain station is located halfway along the horizontal length of the building  between gates A6 and A14   Concourse B  which has 28 gates  composes the western half of the building  It is the first of the permanent elevated midfield concourses  Originally constructed in 1998 and designed by Skidmore  Owings & Merrill and Hellmuth  Obata and Kassabaum  the B concourse contained 20 gates  In 2003  4 additional gates were added to concourse B  followed by a 15 gate expansion in 2008  It is connected to the main terminal by an underground walkway in addition to the AeroTrain station located between gates B51 and B62  Concourse B is used by some international carriers  and is also utilized by all non United domestic and Canada flights  The facility also includes a British Airways Galleries lounge and a Lufthansa Senator lounge   3 2 2  Concourses C and D  Concourses C and D are used for United Airlines flights  including all mainline flights and most United Express regional jet operations  save for a few that use Concourse A    These concourses were constructed in 1983 and designed by Hellmuth  Obata and Kassabaum  The two concourses have 22 gates each  numbered C1 C28 and D1 D32  with odd numbered gates on the north side of the building and even numbered gates on the south side  Concourse C composes the eastern half of the terminal and Concourse D composes the gates on the west half of the terminal  The C D concourses were given a face lift in 2006 which included light fixture upgrades  new paint finishes  new ceiling grids and tiles  heating and air conditioning replacement  and complete restroom renovations   Concourse C also has a dedicated Federal Inspection Station located at ground level  International United flights therefore can deplane passengers via jetbridge at Concourse C  as opposed to using plane mates to offload passengers   and subsequently passengers connecting onwards and passengers with Dulles as their final destination are separated  Passengers with Dulles as their final destination are directed onto a mobile lounge that transports them to the International Arrivals Building  while passengers connecting to another United flight clear U S  Customs and Immigration at the FIS station on the ground level  Since this immigration facility is only for connecting passengers on United and other Star Alliance carriers  it has shorter lines and passengers don t have to reclear security at the massive security checkpoints in the main terminal   There are three United Clubs in the facility  one next to Gate C7  one next to gate C17  and one next to gate D8  There is also a United International First Lounge near gate C2   A new and permanent C D concourse  also called  Tier 2   is planned as part of the D2 Dulles Development Project  The new building is to include a three level structure with 44 airline gates and similar amenities to Concourse B  The concourse plan includes a dedicated mezzanine corridor with moving sidewalks to serve international passengers  The design and construction of the new C D concourse has not been scheduled   4  Airlines and destinations  4 1  Passenger  Avianca s flight to La Paz makes a stop in Bogotá  Ethiopian Airlines  flight from Addis Ababa to Dulles stops at Rome Fiumicino  but the flight from Dulles to Addis Ababa is nonstop   4 1 1  Airline lounges  Since many major domestic and international airlines have a large presence at Washington Dulles  there are several airline lounges in active operation there   Air France  Air France Lounge  A Concourse across from gate A22   British Airways  Galleries Club and Galleries First lounges  each with their own separate dining rooms  B Concourse   Etihad Airways  First and Business class lounge located opposite gate A15   Lufthansa  Senator Lounge and Business Lounge  B Concourse at gate B51   United Airlines  Two United Clubs in Concourse C and one on Concourse D  There is also a United International First Lounge on Concourse C   Virgin Atlantic  Clubhouse  A Concourse across from gate A32  4 2  Cargo  5  Ground transportation  5 1  Roads  Dulles is accessible via the Dulles Access Road Dulles Greenway  State Route 267  and State Route 28  The Dulles Airport Access Highway  DAAH  is a toll free  limited access  highway owned by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority  MWAA  to facilitate car access to Dulles from the Washington Capital Beltway and Interstate 66  After it opened  non airport traffic between Washington and Reston became so heavy that a parallel set of toll lanes were added on the same right of way to accommodate non airport traffic  Dulles Toll Road   However  the airport only lanes are both less congested as well as toll free  As of November 1  2008  MWAA assumed responsibility from the Virginia Department of Transportation both for operating the Dulles Toll Road and for the construction of a rapid transit rail line down its median  Route 28  which runs north–south along the eastern edge of the airport  has been upgraded to a limited access highway  with the interchanges financed through a property tax surcharge on nearby business properties  The Dulles Toll Road has been extended to the west to Leesburg as the Dulles Greenway   5 2  Mass transportation  Fairfax Connector routes 981 and 983 serve Dulles  connecting to the Herndon–Monroe park & ride lot in Herndon  the Reston Town Center transit in Reston  the Wiehle – Reston East Metro station  and the Steven F  Udvar Hazy Center Air and Space Museum     the only Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority service to Dulles is the  Express  5A Metrobus route  The 5A express bus makes two stops on its way from the airport to downtown Washington  Stops include the Herndon–Monroe park & ride lot in Herndon and the Rosslyn Metro station in Arlington  It terminates at the L Enfant Plaza Metro station in Southwest DC  Both metro stations can be accessed by the Orange  Blue  and Silver lines  while the latter can also be accessed by the Yellow and Green lines   An alternative  but slightly more expensive  way of reaching Dulles is the Washington Flyer Coach bus service that operates roughly every twenty minutes between the airport and the Wiehle – Reston East Metro station  Washington Flyer service will be permanently discontinued when Phase II of the Silver Line opens in 2018   Passengers connecting to the Shenandoah Valley can use the Shenandoah Valley Commuter Bus  which connects to the Vienna and Rosslyn Metro stations  Taxis and SuperShuttle ride sharing vans are also available   5 3  Planned  Construction is now underway to connect the airport to Washington via the Silver Line of the Washington Metro  While initial plans called for completion of the station in 2016  officials now expect the construction to be completed in 2018   6  Incidents and accidents  6 1  Accidents  On May 29  1972  the pilot of a Kite Rider  a variety of hang glider  was killed in a crash  This was during day 3 of a 9 day Air Show held at Dulles in conjunction with Transpo  72  officially called the U S  International Transportation Exposition  a $10 million event sponsored by the U S  Department of Transportation  and attended by over one million visitors from around the world   This was to be the first of three air deaths during the Air Show   On June 3  1972  a second death occurred at the Transpo  72 Air Show  during a sport plane pylon race  At 2 40 pm  during the second lap and near a turn about pylon 3  a trailing aircraft s  LOWERS R 1 N66AN  wing and propeller hit the right wing tip of a leading aircraft  CASSUTT BARTH N7017   The right wing immediately sheared off the fuselage  and the damaged aircraft crashed almost instantly  killing the 29 year old pilot  Hugh C  Alexander of Louisville  Georgia  U S  He was a professional Air Racer with over 10 200 hours  This was to be the second of three air deaths during the Air Show   On June 4  1972  during the last day of the 9 day Transpo  72 Air Show  the U S  Air Force Thunderbirds experienced their first fatal crash at an air show  Major Joe Howard flying Thunderbird 3 was killed at Dulles when his F 4E 32 MC Phantom II  66 0321  experienced a loss of power during a vertical maneuver  The pilot broke out of formation just after he completed a wedge roll and was ascending at around 2 500 feet AGL  The aircraft staggered and descended in a flat attitude with little forward speed  Although Major Howard ejected as the aircraft fell back to earth from about 1 500 feet  460 m  tail first  and descended under a good canopy  winds blew him into the fireball ascending from the blazing crash site  The parachute melted and the pilot plummeted 200 feet  sustaining fatal injuries  This was to be the third of three air deaths during the Air Show   On December 1  1974  a flight diverted to Dulles  TWA Flight 514  crashed onto the western slope of Mount Weather  All 85 passengers and 7 crew members were killed on impact   On June 18  1994  a Learjet 25 operated by Mexican carrier TAESA crashed in trees while approaching the airport from the south  Twelve people died  The passengers were planning to attend the 1994 FIFA World Cup soccer games being staged in Washington  D C   6 2  Incidents  On June 14  1979  the number 5 and 6 tires on an Air France Concorde blew out during takeoff  Shrapnel thrown from the tires and rims damaged number 2 engine  punctured three fuel tanks  severed several hydraulic lines and electrical wires  in addition to tearing a large hole on the top of the wing  over the wheel well area   On July 21  1979  one month after the above tire accident  another Air France Concorde blew several of its landing gear tires during takeoff  After that second incident the  French director general of civil aviation issued an air worthiness directive and Air France issued a Technical Information Update  each calling for revised procedures  These included required inspection of each wheel tire for condition  pressure and temperature prior to each take off  In addition  crews were advised that landing gear should not be raised when a wheel tire problem is suspected    In the September 11  2001 attacks  American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked while en route from Dulles to Los Angeles and flown into the Pentagon   7  See also  Busiest
