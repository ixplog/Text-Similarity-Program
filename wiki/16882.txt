Amsterdam Airport Schiphol  KLM operates scheduled passenger and cargo services to more than 130 destinations worldwide  It is the oldest airline in the world still operating under its original name  it had 32 505 employees   The merger of KLM with Air France in May 2004 formed the Air France KLM Group  which is incorporated under French law with headquarters at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport  Both Air France and KLM continue to fly under their distinct brand names as subsidiaries of the group  Air France and KLM are part of the SkyTeam alliance  the second largest in the world behind only the Star Alliance   1  History  1 1  Formation and early years  In 1919  a young aviator lieutenant named Albert Plesman sponsored the ELTA aviation exhibition in Amsterdam  This aviation exhibition was a great success  and  after closure  several Dutch commercial interests had the intention to establish a Dutch airline  Plesman was nominated to head this new airline  In September 1919  Queen Wilhelmina awarded the yet to be founded KLM its  Royal    Koninklijke   predicate  On October 7  1919  KLM  which is the abbreviation for Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij which literally means Royal Airlines in English  was founded by Albert Plesman in The Hague as one of the world s first commercial airline companies   The first KLM flight took place on 17 May 1920  KLM s first pilot  Jerry Shaw  flew from Croydon Airport  London to Amsterdam  The flight was flown using a leased Aircraft Transport and Travel De Haviland DH 16  registration G EALU  and was carrying two British journalists and a number of newspapers  In 1920  KLM carried 440 passengers and 22 tons of freight  In April 1921  after a winter hiatus  KLM resumed its services using its own pilots and aircraft  Fokker F II and Fokker F III  In 1921  KLM started scheduled services   KLM s first intercontinental flight was initiated on the 1st of October 1924  This flight had Batavia  Colonial Jakarta  on the island Java in the Dutch East Indies as the final destination and was flown by a Fokker F VII with registration H NACC and was piloted by Van Der Hoop  In September 1929  regular scheduled services between Amsterdam and Batavia commenced  Until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939  this was the world s longest distance scheduled service by airplane   By 1926  it was offering flights to Amsterdam  Rotterdam  Brussels  Paris  London  Bremen  Copenhagen  and Malmö  using primarily Fokker F2 & Fokker F III   In 1930  KLM carried 15 143 passengers  The Douglas DC 2 was introduced on the Batavia service in 1934   The first experimental transatlantic KLM flight was between Amsterdam and Curaçao in December 1934 using the Fokker F XVIII  Snip   The first of the airline s Douglas DC 3 aircraft were delivered in 1936  and these replaced the DC 2s on the service via Batavia to Sydney  KLM was the first airline to serve Manchester s new Ringway airport  starting June 1938  KLM was the only civilian airline to operate the Douglas DC 5  using four of them in the Dutch East and West Indies between May 1940 and late 1941   1 1 1  Second World War  When German military forces invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940  a number of KLM aircraft  mostly DC 3s and a few DC 2s  were en route to or from the Far East or operating services in Europe  Five DC 3s and one DC 2 managed to escape to England  During the war  these KLM planes and crew members would fly the Bristol Lisbon scheduled passenger flights under BOAC registration   The Douglas DC 3 PH ALI  Ibis   then registered as G AGBB  was attacked three times by the Luftwaffe  on 15 November 1942  19 April 1943  and finally on 1 June 1943  fatal to passengers and crew  see BOAC Flight 777   Some KLM aircraft with their crews ended up in the Australia Indonesia region  where they aided in transporting people who were escaping the Japanese aggression in that area   1 1 2  Post World War II  After the ending of the Second World War in the fall of 1945  KLM immediately started to rebuild its network  Since the Dutch East Indies were in a state of revolt  Plesman s first priority was to reestablish KLM s route to Batavia  This service was reinstated by the end of 1945  Domestic and European flights resumed in September 1945  initially with a fleet of Douglas DC 3s and Douglas DC 4s  On 21 May 1946  KLM was the first continental European airline to start transatlantic scheduled flights between Amsterdam and New York City using Douglas DC 4 aircraft  By 1948  KLM had reconstructed its network and service resumed to Africa  North and South America  and the Caribbean  Long range pressurized Lockheed Constellations and Douglas DC 6s joined KLM s fleet in the late 1940s  the Convair 240 short range pressurized twin engined airliner began European flights for the company in late 1948   During the immediate postwar period  the Dutch government expressed interest in gaining a majority stake in the airline and thus nationalizing KLM  Plesman  however  wanted KLM to remain a private company under private control and thus only allowed the Dutch government a minority stake in KLM   In 1950  KLM carried 356 069 passengers  The expansion of the network continued in the 1950s with the addition of several destinations in western North America  KLM s fleet expanded as well with the addition of new versions of the Lockheed Constellation and Lockheed Electra  of which KLM was the first European airline to fly   On 31 December 1953  the founder and president of KLM  Albert Plesman  died at the age of 64  Fons Aler succeeded Albert Plesman as KLM s president  After the death of Plesman  the company and other airlines entered a difficult economic period  The conversion to jet airplanes placed a further financial burden on KLM  Besides all this  the Dutch government increased its ownership of the company to two thirds  and thus hereby nationalized the airline  The board of directors  however  remained under the control of the private shareholders   On 25 July 1957  the airline introduced its flight simulator for the Douglas DC 7C – the last KLM aircraft with piston engines – which opened the transpolar route from Amsterdam via Anchorage to Tokyo on 1 November 1958  Each crew flying the transpolar route over the Arctic was equipped with a winter survival kit  including a 7 62 mm selective fire AR 10 carbine for use against polar bears  in the event the plane was forced down onto the polar ice   1 2  Jet age  Beginning in September 1959  the airline introduced the four engine turboprop Lockheed Electra onto some of its European and Middle Eastern routes  In March 1960  KLM introduced the first Douglas DC 8 jet into its fleet  In 1961  KLM reported its first year of losses  In 1961  the president of KLM  Fons Aler  was succeeded by Ernst van der Beugel  This change of leadership  however  did not lead to a reversion of KLM s financial difficulties  Van der Beugel resigned as president in 1963 due to health reasons  Horatius Albarda was appointed to succeed Ernst van der Beugel as president of KLM in 1963  Alberda initiated a reorganization of the company  which led to the reduction of staff and air services  In 1965  Alberda died in an air crash  Dr  Gerrit van der Wal succeeded Alberda as president of KLM  Van der Wal forged an agreement with the Dutch government that KLM would be run once again as a private company without interference of the government  By 1966  the stake of the Dutch government in KLM was reduced to a minority stake of 49 5%  In 1966  KLM introduced the Douglas DC 9 on European and Middle East routes   The new terminal buildings at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened in April 1967 and in 1968  the stretched Douglas DC 8 63 entered service  With 244 seats  it was the largest airliner at the time  KLM was the first airline to put the higher gross weight Boeing 747 200B into service  starting in February 1971  powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines  thus beginning the airline s era of widebody jets  In March 1971  KLM opened its current headquarters in Amstelveen  In 1972  KLM purchased the first of several Douglas DC 10 aircraft  This jet was McDonnell Douglas s response to Boeing s 747   In 1973  Sergio Orlandini was appointed to succeed Gerrit van der Wal as president of KLM  At the time  KLM  as well as other airlines  had to deal with overcapacity  Orlandini proposed to convert KLM 747s to  combis  that could carry a combination of passengers and freight  In November 1975  the first of these Boeing 747 300B Combi aircraft were added to the KLM fleet   The oil crisis of 1973  which caused difficult economic conditions  led KLM to seek government assistance in arranging debt refinancing  KLM issued additional shares of stock to the government  in return for its money  In the late 1970s  the government s stake had again increased to a majority stake of 78%  KLM thus  again  was nationalized  The company management  however  remained under control of the private stakeholders   1 3  1980s and 1990s  In 1980  KLM carried 9 715 069 passengers  In 1983  it reached an agreement with Boeing to convert some of its Boeing 747 200s to stretched upper deck configuration  The work started in 1984 at the Boeing factory in Everett  Washington and finished in 1986  The converted aircraft were called Boeing 747 200SUD  which the airline operated in addition to Boeing 747 300s  In 1983 as well  KLM took delivery of its first  of ten  Airbus A310 passenger jets  Sergio Orlandini retired in 1987 and was succeeded by Jan de Soet as president of KLM  In 1986  the share of the Dutch government in KLM was reduced to 54 8 percent  It was expected that this share would be reduced further during the decade  The Boeing 747 400 was introduced into KLM s fleet in June 1989   With the liberalization of the European market  KLM started with the development of its hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol by feeding its network with traffic from affiliated airlines  A major step in the development of a worldwide network was the acquisition of a 20% stake in Northwest Airlines in July 1989   In 1990  KLM carried 16 000 000 passengers  KLM president Jan de Soet retired at the end of 1990 and was succeeded in 1991 by Pieter Bouw  In December 1991  KLM was the first European airline to introduce a frequent flyer loyalty program  which was called Flying Dutchman   1 4  Joint venture  In January 1993  the US Department of Transportation granted KLM and Northwest Airlines antitrust immunity  which allowed the two airlines to intensify their partnership  As of September 1993  the partners operated all their flights between the US and Europe as part of a joint venture  In March 1994  KLM and Northwest Airlines introduced World Business Class on intercontinental routes  KLM s stake in Northwest Airlines was increased to 25% in 1994   KLM introduced the Boeing 767 300ER in July 1995  In January 1996  KLM acquired a 26% share in the flag carrier of Kenya  Kenya Airways  In 1997  Pieter Bouw resigned as president of KLM  he was succeeded by Leo van Wijk  In August 1998  KLM repurchased all regular shares from the Dutch government to make KLM  once again  a private company  On November 1  1999  KLM founded AirCares  a communication and fundraising platform supporting worthy causes and focusing on underprivileged children around the world   KLM renewed its intercontinental fleets by replacing the Boeing 767s  Boeing 747 300s  and eventually the McDonnell Douglas MD 11 with Boeing 777 200ERs and Airbus A330 200s  Some 747s would be first to retire  The MD 11s will remain in service until 2014  The first Boeing 777 was received on 25 October 2003  entering commercial service on the Amsterdam–Toronto route  while the first Airbus A330 200 was introduced on 25 August 2005 and entered commercial service on the Amsterdam–Washington Dulles route   1 5  Air France–KLM merger  On 30 September 2003  Air France and KLM agreed to a merger plan in which Air France and KLM would become subsidiaries of a holding company called Air France KLM  Both airlines would retain their own brands and both Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol would become the key hubs  In February 2004  the European Commission and US Department of Justice approved the proposed merger of Air France and KLM  In April 2004  an exchange offer took place in which KLM shareholders exchanged their KLM shares for Air France shares  The merger of Air France and KLM was approved by the shareholders in April 2004  By exchanging the KLM shares for Air France shares  the merger was therefore fulfilled  On 4 May 2004  the exchange offer was called successful  As of 5 May 2004  the merger of Air France and KLM was a done deal  Since 5 May 2004  Air France – KLM has been listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris  Amsterdam and New York  In September 2004  the merger was completed by creation of the Air France KLM holding company  The merger of Air France and KLM resulted in the world s largest airline group  The merger should lead to an annual total cost saving of between 400 and 500 million euros   It did not appear that KLM s longstanding joint venture with Northwest Airlines  since merged with Delta Air Lines in 2008  was affected by the merger with Air France  Both KLM and Northwest joined the SkyTeam alliance in September 2004   In March 2007  KLM started to use the Amadeus reservation system  along with partner Kenya Airways  Furthermore  after 10 years  Leo van Wijk resigned from his position as president of KLM  being succeeded by Peter Hartman   1 6  Recent developments  In January 2010  Northwest Airlines was merged to Delta Air Lines

Dirk Roosenburg designed the iconic KLM logo  In this logo  Roosenburg intertwined the letter K  L  and M and gave them wings and a crown  The crown was depicted to denote KLM s royal status  which was granted at KLM s establishment  The logo became known as the  vinklogo   referring to the Chaffinch bird breed   In 1925  the original KLM logo was revised so that it looked more dynamic compared to the original logo  The biggest revision of the KLM logo so far took place in 1961  In this year  F H K  Henrion designed the current KLM logo  The crown remained in the logo  formed by the line  the four blue circles  and the cross on top of the logo  In 1991  the logo was further revised by Chris Ludlow of Henrion  Ludlow & Schmidt  In addition to its main logo  KLM has shown its alliance status in its branding  including  Worldwide Reliability  with Northwest Airlines  1993–2002  and the SkyTeam alliance  2004–present    2 2 1  Livery and uniforms  The former KLM livery featured a bright blue fuselage  with a wide white and dark blue strip above the grey belly of the aircraft  The KLM logo was placed on the white tail  The KLM logo was placed centrally at the tail and place at the front part of the fuselage  In December 2002  KLM introduced its current livery  In this change  the white strip was dropped while the dark blue strip was transformed into a cheatline  The bright blue color was retained and now covers most of the fuselage  The KLM logo was placed more centrally on the fuselage  while the position of the logo on the tail and the tail design remained the same

Eyjafjallajökull erupted in April 2010  which caused extreme disruptions to air traffic  Customers used the social channels to reach KLM  In turn KLM decided to utilize these social networks to reach out to customers and provide them with information about the situation  Following the increased use of social media  KLM decided to create a centralized social media site for the public in October 2010  establishing the Social Media Hub   KLM developed several services based on these social platforms  including   Meet & Seat  this service lets passengers find out about interesting people who

was made to Bols young genever   KLM started to hand out the houses in 1952 to its First Class passengers  However  with the elimination of First Class in 1993  the houses were instead handed out to all Business Class passengers  The impetus for these houses was a rule aimed at curtailing a previously widespread practice of offering significant incentives to passengers by limiting the value of gifts given by airlines to  75 US cents  KLM did not bill the Delft Blue Houses as a gift  but rather as a last drink on the house  which was served in the house   Every year  a new house is presented on 7 October  the anniversary of KLM s founding in 1919  The number on the last presented house thus represents the number of years KLM has been in operation  There are various special edition houses which are offered to special guests  like VIPs or honeymoon couples   These special edition houses are the Dutch Royal Palace and the 17th century Cheese Weighing House De Waag in Gouda   6 4  Ground services  KLM offers various check in methods to their passengers  Passengers are able to check in for their flights at the self service check in kiosks at the airport  via the Internet  and via a mobile phone or tablet  Check in by an airline representative at the counter is provided at destinations where the above mentioned facilities are not available  Electronic boarding passes can be received at a mobile phone or tablet while boarding passes can be printed at the airport through the kiosks   Since 4 July 2008 KLM  in cooperation with Amsterdam Airport Schiphol  has been a pioneer by offering self service baggage drop off to their passengers  The project started with a pilot which included just one drop off point  However  the number of self service baggage drop off points has gradually increased and there are 12 self service baggage drop off points  Together with the self service check in kiosks  KLM passengers are now able to check in without any contact with a KLM employee   In November 2012  KLM started a pilot at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol to test self service boarding  The passengers board the aircraft without interference of a gate agent by scanning their boarding pass  which will open a gate  Partner Air France ran the same pilot at its hub at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport  The pilot ran until March 2013  which was followed by an evaluation   KLM is the first airline in the world to offer self service transfer kiosks on its European and intercontinental routes for passengers connecting through Amsterdam Airport Schiphol  The self service transfer kiosks enable connecting passengers to view flight details of connecting flights  to change seat assignments or upgrade to a more comfortable seat  When a passenger misses a connecting flight  details about alternative flights can be viewed on the kiosk and a new boarding pass can be printed  Furthermore  coupons for a beverage  meal  the use of a telephone  or travel discount can be printed from the kiosk when a passenger is entitled to such coupons   6 5  Flying Blue  Air France KLM s frequent flyer programme  Flying Blue  awards members miles based on the distance travelled  ticket fare and
