Orkney     also known as the Orkney Islands  is an archipelago in northern Scotland  16 kilometres  10 mi  north of the coast of Caithness  Orkney comprises approximately 70 islands  of which 20 are inhabited  The largest island  known as the  Mainland   has an area of 523 25 square kilometres  202 sq mi   making it the sixth largest Scottish island and the tenth largest island in the British Isles  The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall   The name  Orkney  dates back to the 1st century BC or earlier  and the islands have been inhabited for at least 8 500 years  Originally occupied by Mesolithic and Neolithic tribes and then by the Picts  Orkney was invaded and forcibly annexed by Norway in 875 and settled by the Norse  The Scottish Parliament then re annexed the earldom to the Scottish Crown in 1472  following the failed payment of a dowry for James III s bride  Margaret of Denmark  Orkney contains some of the oldest and best preserved Neolithic sites in Europe  and the  Heart of Neolithic Orkney  is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site   Orkney is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland  a constituency of the Scottish Parliament  a lieutenancy area  and a former county  The local council is Orkney Islands Council  one of only three Councils in Scotland with a majority of elected members who are independents   In addition to the Mainland  most of the islands are in two groups  the North and South Isles  all of which have an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone  The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile  most of the land being farmed  Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy and the significant wind and marine energy resources are of growing importance  The local people are known as Orcadians and have a distinctive Scots dialect and a rich inheritance of folklore  There is an abundance of marine and avian wildlife   1  Origin of the name  Pytheas of Massilia visited Britain – probably sometime between 322 and 285 BC – and described it as triangular in shape  with a northern tip called Orcas  This may have referred to Dunnet Head  from which Orkney is visible  Writing in the 1st century AD  the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela called the islands Orcades  as did Tacitus in AD 98  claiming that his father in law Agricola had  discovered and subjugated the Orcades hitherto unknown   although both Mela and Pliny had previously referred to the islands   Etymologists usually interpret the element orc  as a Pictish tribal name meaning  young pig  or  young boar   Speakers of Old Irish referred to the islands as Insi Orc   island of the pigs    The archipelago is known as Arcaibh in modern Scottish Gaelic  the  aibh representing a fossilized prepositional case ending   Norwegian settlers arriving from the late 9th century re interpreted orc as Old Norse orkn  seal   with the added suffix ey  island   Thus the name became Orkneyjar  meaning  seal islands    later shortened to  Orkney  in English  According to the Historia Norvegiæ  Orkney was named after an earl called Orkan   The Norse knew Mainland Orkney as Megenland  mainland  or as Hrossey  horse island   The island is sometimes referred to as Pomona  or Pomonia   a name that stems from a sixteenth century mis translation by George Buchanan and has rarely been used locally   2  History  2 1  Prehistory  A charred hazelnut shell  recovered in 2007 during excavations in Tankerness on the Mainland has been dated to 6820–6660 BC indicating the presence of Mesolithic nomadic tribes  The earliest known permanent settlement is at Knap of Howar  a Neolithic farmstead on the island of Papa Westray  which dates from 3500 BC  The village of Skara Brae  Europe s best preserved Neolithic settlement  is believed to have been inhabited from around 3100 BC  Other remains from that era include the Standing Stones of Stenness  the Maeshowe passage grave  the Ring of Brodgar and other standing stones  Many of the Neolithic settlements were abandoned around 2500 BC  possibly due to changes in the climate   During the Bronze Age fewer large stone structures were built although the great ceremonial circles continued in use as metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period  There are relatively few Orcadian sites dating from this era although there is the impressive Plumcake Mound near the Ring of Brodgar and various islands sites such as Tofts Ness on Sanday and the remains of two houses on Holm of Faray   2 2  Iron Age  Excavations at Quanterness on the Mainland have revealed an Atlantic roundhouse built about 700 BC and similar finds have been made at Bu on the Mainland and Pierowall Quarry on Westray  The most impressive Iron Age structures of Orkney are the ruins of later round towers called  brochs  and their associated settlements such as the Broch of Burroughston and Broch of Gurness  The nature and origin of these buildings is a subject of ongoing debate  Other structures from this period include underground storehouses  and aisled roundhouses  the latter usually in association with earlier broch sites   During the Roman invasion of Britain the  King of Orkney  was one of 11 British leaders who is said to have submitted to the Emperor Claudius in AD 43 at Colchester  After the Agricolan fleet had come and gone  possibly anchoring at Shapinsay  direct Roman influence seems to have been limited to trade rather than conquest   By the late Iron Age  Orkney was part of the Pictish kingdom  and although the archaeological remains from this period are less impressive there is every reason to suppose the fertile soils and rich seas of Orkney provided the Picts with a comfortable living  The Dalriadic Gaels began to influence the islands towards the close of the Pictish era  perhaps principally through the role of Celtic missionaries  as evidenced by several islands bearing the epithet  Papa  in commemoration of these preachers  However  before the Gaelic presence could establish itself the Picts were gradually dispossessed by the Norsemen from the late 8th century onwards  The nature of this transition is controversial  and theories range from peaceful integration to enslavement and genocide   2 3  Norwegian rule  Both Orkney and Shetland saw a significant influx of Norwegian settlers during the late 8th and early 9th centuries  Vikings made the islands the headquarters of their pirate expeditions carried out against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland  In response  Norwegian king Harald Hårfagre   Harald Fair Hair   annexed the Northern Isles  comprising Orkney and Shetland  in 875   It is clear that this story  which appears in the Orkneyinga Saga is based on the later voyages of Magnus Barelegs and some scholars believe it to be apocryphal   Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of his son in battle in Scotland  and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty   However  Sigurd s line barely survived him and it was Torf Einarr  Rognvald s son by a slave  who founded a dynasty that controlled the islands for centuries after his death  He was succeeded by his son Thorfinn Skull splitter and during this time the deposed Norwegian King Eric Bloodaxe often used Orkney as a raiding base before being killed in 954  Thorfinn s death and presumed burial at the broch of Hoxa  on South Ronaldsay  led to a long period of dynastic strife   Initially a pagan culture  detailed information about the return of the Christian religion to the islands of Scotland during the Norse era is elusive  The Orkneyinga Saga suggests the islands were Christianised by Olav Tryggvasson in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway  The King summoned the jarl Sigurd the Stout and said   I order you and all your subjects to be baptised  If you refuse  I ll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel   Unsurprisingly  Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke  receiving their own bishop in the early 11th century   Thorfinn the Mighty was a son of Sigurd and a grandson of King Máel Coluim mac Cináeda  Malcolm II of Scotland   Along with Sigurd s other sons he ruled Orkney during the first half of the 11th century and extended his authority over a small maritime empire stretching from Dublin to Shetland  Thorfinn died around 1065 and his sons Paul and Erlend succeeded him  fighting at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066  Paul and Erlend quarreled as adults and this dispute carried on to the next generation  The martyrdom of Magnus Erlendsson  who was killed in April 1116 by his cousin Haakon Paulsson  resulted in the building of St  Magnus Cathedral  still today a dominating feature of Kirkwall   Unusually  from c  1100 onwards the Norse jarls owed allegiance both to Norway for Orkney and to the Scottish crown through their holdings as Earls of Caithness  In 1231 the line of Norse earls  unbroken since Rognvald  ended with Jon Haraldsson s murder in Thurso  The Earldom of Caithness was granted to Magnus  second son of the Earl of Angus  whom Haakon IV of Norway confirmed as Earl of Orkney in 1236  In 1290  the death of the child princess Margaret  Maid of Norway in Orkney  en route to mainland Scotland  created a disputed succession that led to the Wars of Scottish Independence  In 1379 the earldom passed to the Sinclair family  who were also barons of Roslin near Edinburgh   Evidence of the Viking presence is widespread  and includes the settlement at the Brough of Birsay  the vast majority of place names  and the runic inscriptions at Maeshowe   2 4  Scottish rule  In 1468 Orkney was pledged by Christian I  in his capacity as king of Norway  as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret  betrothed to James III of Scotland  As the money was never paid  the connection with the crown of Scotland has become perpetual   The history of Orkney prior to this time is largely the history of the ruling aristocracy  From now on the ordinary people emerge with greater clarity  An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers  fishermen and merchants that called themselves comunitas Orcadie and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords   From at least the 16th century  boats from mainland Scotland and the Netherlands dominated the local herring fishery  There is little evidence of an Orcadian fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and then later Stromness becoming leading centres of development  White fish never became as dominant as in other Scottish ports   In the 17th century  Orcadians formed the overwhelming majority of employees of the Hudson s Bay Company in Canada  The harsh climate of Orkney and the Orcadian reputation for sobriety and their boat handling skills made them ideal candidates for the rigours of the Canadian north  During this period  burning kelp briefly became a mainstay of the islands  economy  For example on Shapinsay over of burned seaweed were produced per annum to make soda ash  bringing in £20 000 to the local economy  The industry collapsed suddenly in 1830 after the removal of tariffs on imported alkali   Agricultural improvements beginning in the 17th century resulted in the enclosure of the commons and ultimately in the Victoria era the emergence of large and well managed farms using a five shift rotation system and producing high quality beef cattle   In the 18th century Jacobite Risings Orkney was largely Jacobite in its sympathies  At the end of the 1715 rebellion  a large number of Jacobites who had fled north from mainland Scotland sought refuge on Orkney and were helped on to safety in Sweden  In 1745  the Jacobite lairds on the islands ensured that Orkney remained pro Jacobite in outlook  and was a safe place to land supplies from Spain to aid their cause  Orkney was the last place in the British Isles that held out for the Jacobites and was not retaken by the British Government until 24 May 1746  over a month after the defeat of the main Jacobite army at Culloden   2 5  20th century  Orkney was the site of a Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow  which played a major role in World War I and II  After the Armistice in 1918  the German High Seas Fleet was transferred in its entirety to Scapa Flow to await a decision on its future  The German sailors opened the sea cocks and scuttled all the ships  Most ships were salvaged  but the remaining wrecks are now a favoured haunt of recreational divers  One month into World War II  a German U boat sank the Royal Navy battleship HMS Royal Oak in Scapa Flow  As a result  barriers were built to close most of the access channels  these had the additional advantage of creating causeways enabling travellers to go from island to island by road instead of being obliged to rely on ferries  The causeways were constructed by Italian prisoners of war  who also constructed the ornate Italian Chapel   During World War II  the politicians of German occupied Norway asked German authorities to take over Orkney as Norway sought new opportunities for expansion   The navy base became run down after the war  eventually closing in 1957  The problem of a declining population was significant in the post war years  though in the last decades of the 20th century there was a recovery and life in Orkney focused on growing prosperity and the emergence of a relatively classless society  Orkney was rated as the best place to live in Scotland in both 2013 and 2014 according to the Halifax Quality of Life survey   2 6  Overview of population trends  In the modern era  population peaked in the mid 19th century at just over 26 000 and declined for a century thereafter to a low of fewer than 17 000 in the 1970s  Declines were particularly significant in the outlying islands  some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses  Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends are very similar to those experienced elsewhere  The archipelago s population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census  During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103 702   3  Geography  Orkney is separated from the mainland of Scotland by the Pentland Firth  a wide seaway between Brough Ness on the island of South Ronaldsay and Duncansby Head in Caithness  Orkney lies between 58°41′ and 59°24′ North  and 2°22′ and 3°26′ West  measuring from northeast to southwest and from east to west  and covers    The islands are mainly low lying except for some sharply rising sandstone hills on Hoy  Mainland and Rousay and rugged cliffs on some western coasts  Nearly all of the islands have lochs  but the watercourses are merely streams draining the high land  The coastlines are indented  and the islands themselves are divided from each other by straits generally called  sounds  or  firths    The tidal currents  or  roosts  as some of them are called locally  off many of the isles are swift  with frequent whirlpools  The islands are notable for the absence of trees  which is partly accounted for by the amount of wind   4  Islands  4 1  The Mainland  The Mainland is the largest island of Orkney  Both of Orkney s burghs  Kirkwall and Stromness  are on this island  which is also the heart of Orkney s transportation system  with ferry and air connections to the other islands and to the outside world  The island is more densely populated  75% of Orkney s population  than the other islands and has much fertile farmland  The Mainland is split into areas called East and West Mainland  These areas are determined by whether they lie East or West of Kirkwall  The bulk of the mainland lies West of Kirkwall  with comparatively little land lying East of Kirkwall  West Mainland parishes are  Stromness  Sandwick  Birsay  Harray  Stenness  Orphir  Evie  Rendall and Firth  East Mainland Parishes are  St Ola  Tankerness  St Andrews  Holm and Deerness   The island is mostly low lying  especially East Mainland  but with coastal cliffs to the north and west and two sizeable lochs  the Loch of Harray and the Loch of Stenness  The Mainland contains the remnants of numerous Neolithic  Pictish and Viking constructions  Four of the main Neolithic sites are included in the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site  inscribed in 1999   The other islands in the group are classified as north or south of the Mainland  Exceptions are the remote islets of Sule Skerry and Sule Stack  which lie west of the archipelago  but form part of Orkney for local government purposes  In island names  the suffix  a  or  ay  represents the Norse ey  meaning  island   Those described as  holms  are very small   4 2  The North Isles  The northern group of islands is the most extensive and consists of a large number of moderately sized islands  linked to the Mainland by ferries and by air services  Farming  fishing and tourism are the main sources of income for most of the islands   The most northerly is North Ronaldsay  which lies beyond its nearest neighbour  Sanday  To the west is Westray has a population of 550  It is connected by ferry and air to Papa Westray  also known as  Papay   Eday is at the centre of the North Isles  The centre of the island is moorland and the island s main industries have been peat extraction and limestone quarrying   Rousay  Egilsay and Gairsay lie north of the west Mainland across the Eynhallow Sound  Rousay is well known for its ancient monuments  including the Quoyness chambered cairn and Egilsay has the ruins of the only round towered church in Orkney  Wyre to the south east contains the site of Cubbie Roo s castle  Stronsay and Papa Stronsay lie much further to the east across the Stronsay Firth  Auskerry is south of Stronsay and has a population of only five  Shapinsay and its Balfour Castle are a short distance north of Kirkwall   Other small uninhabited islands in the North Isles group include  Calf of Eday  Damsay  Eynhallow  Faray  Helliar Holm  Holm of Faray  Holm of Huip  Holm of Papa  Holm of Scockness  Kili Holm  Linga Holm  Muckle Green Holm  Rusk Holm and Sweyn Holm   4 3  The South Isles  The southern group of islands surrounds Scapa Flow  Hoy is the second largest of the Orkney Isles and Ward Hill at its northern end is the highest elevation in the archipelago  The Old Man of Hoy is a well known seastack  Burray lies to the east of Scapa Flow and is linked by causeway to South Ronaldsay  which hosts the cultural events  the Festival of the Horse and the Boys  Ploughing Match on the third Saturday in August  It is also the location of the Neolithic Tomb of the Eagles  Graemsay and Flotta are both linked by ferry to the Mainland and Hoy  and the latter is known for its large oil terminal  South Walls has a 19th century Martello tower and is connected to Hoy by the Ayre  South Ronaldsay  Burray  Glims Holm  and Lamb Holm are connected by road to the Mainland by the Churchill Barriers   Uninhabited South Islands include  Calf of Flotta  Cava  Copinsay  Corn Holm  Fara  Glims Holm  Hunda  Lamb Holm  Rysa Little  Switha and Swona  The Pentland Skerries lie further south  closer to the Scottish mainland   5  Geology  The superficial rock of Orkney is almost entirely Old Red Sandstone  mostly of Middle Devonian age  As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness  this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series  as may be seen on the Mainland  where a narrow strip is exposed between Stromness and Inganess  and again in the small island of Graemsay  they are represented by grey gneiss and granite   The Middle Devonian is divided into three main groups  The lower part of the sequence  mostly Eifelian in age  is dominated by lacustrine beds of the lower and upper Stromness Flagstones that were deposited in Lake Orcadie  The later Rousay flagstone formation is found throughout much of the North and South Isles and East Mainland  The Old Man of Hoy is formed from sandstone of the uppermost Eday group that is up to thick in places  It lies unconformably upon steeply inclined flagstones  the interpretation of which is a matter of continuing debate   The Devonian and older rocks of Orkney are cut by a series of WSW ENE to N S trending faults  many of which were active during deposition of the Devonian sequences  A strong synclinal fold traverses Eday and Shapinsay  the axis trending north south   Middle Devonian basaltic volcanic rocks are found on western Hoy  on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay  Correlation between the Hoy volcanics and the other two exposures has been proposed  but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain  Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney   Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands  Boulder clay is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas   6  Climate  Orkney has a cool temperate climate that is remarkably mild and steady for such a northerly latitude  due to the influence of the Gulf Stream  The average temperature for the year is   for winter and for summer    The average annual rainfall varies from to   Winds are a key feature of the climate and even in summer there are almost constant breezes  In winter  there are frequent strong winds  with an average of 52 hours of gales being recorded annually   To tourists  one of the fascinations of the islands is their  nightless  summers  On the longest day  the sun rises at 03 00 and sets at 21 29 GMT and complete darkness is unknown  This long twilight is known in the Northern Isles as the  simmer dim   Winter nights are long  On the shortest day the sun rises at 09 05 and sets at 15 16  At this time of year the aurora borealis can occasionally be seen on the northern horizon during moderate auroral activity   7  Politics  Orkney is represented in the House of Commons as part of the Orkney and Shetland constituency  which elects one Member of Parliament  MP   the current incumbent being Alistair Carmichael  This seat has been held by the Liberal Democrats or their predecessors the Liberal Party since 1950  longer than any other they represent in Great Britain   In the Scottish Parliament the Orkney constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament  MSP  by the first past the post system  The current MSP is Liam McArthur of the Liberal Democrats  Before McArthur the MSP was Jim Wallace  who was previously Deputy First Minister  Orkney is within the Highlands and Islands electoral region   Orkney Islands Council consists of 21 members  all of whom are independent  that is they do not stand as representatives of a political party   The Orkney Movement  a political party that supported devolution for Orkney from the rest of Scotland  contested the 1987 general election as the Orkney and Shetland Movement  a coalition of the Orkney movement and its equivalent for Shetland   The Scottish National Party chose not to contest the seat to give the movement a  free run   Their candidate  John Goodlad  came 4th with 3 095 votes  14 5% of those cast  but the experiment has not been repeated   8  Economy  The soil of Orkney is generally very fertile and most of the land is taken up by farms  agriculture being by far the most important sector of the economy and providing employment for a quarter of the workforce  More than 90% of agricultural land is used for grazing for sheep and cattle  with cereal production utilising about 4%    and woodland occupying only    Fishing has declined in importance  but still employed 345 individuals in 2001  about 3 5% of the islands  economically active population  the modern industry concentrating on herring  white fish  lobsters  crabs and other shellfish  and salmon fish farming   Today  the traditional sectors of the economy export beef  cheese  whisky  beer  fish and other seafood  In recent years there has been growth in other areas including tourism  food and beverage manufacture  jewellery  knitwear  and other crafts production  construction and oil transportation through the Flotta oil terminal  Retailing accounts for 17 5% of total employment  and public services also play a significant role  employing a third of the islands  workforce   In 2007  of the 1 420 VAT registered enterprises 55% were in agriculture  forestry and fishing  12% in manufacturing and construction  12% in wholesale  retail and repairs  and 5% in hotels and restaurants  A further 5% were public service related  55% of these businesses employ between 5 and 49 people   Orkney has significant wind and marine energy resources  and renewable energy has recently come into prominence  The European Marine Energy Centre  EMEC  is a Scottish Government backed research facility that has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney Mainland and a tidal power testing station on the island of Eday  At the official opening of the Eday project the site was described as  the first of its kind in the world set up to provide developers of wave and tidal energy devices with a purpose built performance testing facility   Funding for the UK s first wave farm was announced by the Scottish Government in 2007  It will be the world s largest  with a capacity of 3 MW generated by four Pelamis machines at a cost of over £4 million  During 2007 Scottish and Southern Energy plc in conjunction with the University of Strathclyde began the implementation of a Regional Power Zone in the Orkney archipelago  This scheme  that may be the first of its kind in the world  involves  active network management  that will make better use of existing infrastructure and allow a further 15MW of new  non firm generation  output from renewables onto the network   8 1  Transport  8 1 1  Air  Highland and Islands Airports operates the main airport in Orkney  Kirkwall Airport  Loganair  a franchise of Flybe  provides services to the Scottish mainland  Aberdeen  Edinburgh  Glasgow International and Inverness   as well as to Sumburgh Airport in Shetland   Within Orkney  the council operates airfields on most of the larger islands including Stronsay  Eday  North Ronaldsay  Westray  Papa Westray  and Sanday  Reputedly the shortest scheduled air service in the world  between the islands of Westray and Papa Westray  is scheduled at two minutes duration but can take less than one minute if the wind is in the right direction   8 1 2  Ferry  Ferries serve both to link Orkney to the rest of Scotland  and also to link together the various islands of the Orkney archipelago  Ferry services operate between Orkney and the Scottish mainland and Shetland on the following routes   Gills Bay to St Margaret s Hope  operated by Pentland Ferries   John o  Groats to Burwick on South Ronaldsay  seasonal passenger only service  operated by John o  Groats Ferries   Lerwick to Kirkwall  operated by NorthLink Ferries   Aberdeen to Kirkwall  operated by NorthLink Ferries   Scrabster Harbour  Thurso to Stromness  operated by NorthLink Ferries  Inter island ferry services connect all the inhabited islands to Orkney Mainland  and are operated by Orkney Ferries  a company owned by Orkney Islands Council   8 2  Media  Orkney is served by a weekly local newspaper  The Orcadian   A local BBC radio station  BBC Radio Orkney  the local opt out of BBC Radio Scotland  broadcasts twice daily  with local news and entertainment  Orkney also had a commercial radio station  The Superstation Orkney  which broadcast to Kirkwall and parts of the mainland and also to most of Caithness until its closure on November 2014  Moray Firth Radio broadcasts throughout Orkney on AM and from an FM transmitter just outside Thurso  The community radio station Caithness FM also broadcasts to Orkney   9  Language  literature and folklore  At the beginning of recorded history the islands were inhabited by the Picts  whose language was Brythonic  The Ogham script on the Buckquoy spindle whorl is cited as evidence for the pre Norse existence of Old Irish in Orkney   After the Norse occupation the toponymy of Orkney became almost wholly West Norse  The Norse language evolved into the local Norn  which lingered until the end of the 18th century  when it finally died out  Norn was replaced by the Orcadian dialect of Insular Scots  This dialect is at a low ebb due to the pervasive influences of television  education and the large number of incomers  However  attempts are being made by some writers and radio presenters to revitalise its use and the distinctive sing song accent and many dialect words of Norse origin remain in use  The Orcadian word most frequently encountered by visitors is peedie  meaning small  which may derive from the French petit   Orkney has a rich folklore and many of the former tales concern trows  an Orcadian form of troll that draws on the islands  Scandinavian connections  Local customs in the past included marriage ceremonies at the Odin Stone that formed part of the Stones of Stenness   The best known literary figures from modern Orkney are the poet Edwin Muir  the poet and novelist George Mackay Brown and the novelist Eric Linklater   10  Orcadians  An Orcadian is a native of Orkney  a term that reflects a strongly held identity with a tradition of understatement  Although the annexation of the earldom by Scotland took place over five centuries ago in 1472  most Orcadians regard themselves as Orcadians first and Scots second   When an Orcadian speaks of  Scotland   they are talking about the land to the immediate south of the Pentland Firth  When an Orcadian speaks of  the mainland   they mean Mainland  Orkney  Tartan  clans  bagpipes and the like are traditions of the Scottish Highlands and are not a part of the islands  indigenous culture  However  at least two tartans with Orkney connections have been registered and a tartan has been designed for Sanday by one of the island s residents  and there are pipe bands in Orkney   Native Orcadians refer to the non native residents of the islands as  ferry loupers   a term that has been in use for nearly two centuries at least   11  Natural history  Orkney has an abundance of wildlife  especially of grey and common seals and seabirds such as puffins  kittiwakes  tysties  ravens  and bonxies  Whales  dolphins  otters are also seen around the coasts  Inland the Orkney vole  a distinct subspecies of the common vole  is an endemic  There are five distinct varieties  found on the islands of Sanday  Westray  Rousay  South Ronaldsay  and the Mainland  all the more remarkable as the species is absent on mainland Britain   The coastline is well known for its colourful flowers including sea aster  sea squill  sea thrift  common sea lavender  bell and common heather  The Scottish primrose is found only on the coasts of Orkney and nearby Caithness and Sutherland  Although stands of trees are generally rare  a small forest named Happy Valley with 700 trees and lush gardens was created from a boggy hillside near Stenness during the second half of the 20th century   The North Ronaldsay sheep is an unusual breed of domesticated animal  subsisting largely on a diet of seaweed  since they are confined to the foreshore for most of the year to conserve the limited grazing inland  The island was also a habitat for the Atlantic walrus until the mid 16th century   The Orkney char  Salvelinus inframundus  used to live in Heldale Water on Hoy  It has been considered locally extinct since 1908   12  See also
