The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration  UNRRA  was an international relief agency  largely dominated by the United States but representing 44 nations  Founded in 1943  it became part of the United Nations in 1945  and it largely shut down operations in 1947  Its purpose was to  plan  co ordinate  administer or arrange for the administration of measures for the relief of victims of war in any area under the control of any of the United Nations through the provision of food  fuel  clothing  shelter and other basic necessities  medical and other essential services   Its staff of civil servants included 12 000 people  with headquarters in New York  Funding came from many nations  and totaled $3 7 billion  of which the United States contributed $2 7 billion  Britain $625 million and Canada $139 million   UNRRA cooperated closely with dozens of volunteer charitable organizations  who sent hundreds of their own agencies to work alongside UNRRA  In operation only three years  the agency distributed about $4 billion worth of goods  food  medicine  tools  and farm implements at a time of severe global shortages and worldwide transportation difficulties  The recipient nations had been especially hard hit by starvation  dislocation  and political chaos  It played a major role in helping Displaced Persons return to their home countries in Europe in 1945 46  Its UN functions were transferred to several UN agencies  including the International Refugee Organization and the World Health Organization  As an American relief agency  it was largely replaced by the Marshall Plan  which began operations in 1948   1  Founding and authority  U S  president Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed the agency in June  1943  to provide relief to areas liberated from Axis powers after World War II ended  Roosevelt had already obtained the approval of the United Kingdom  the Soviet Union  and China  he later obtained endorsements from 40 other governments to form the first  United Nations  organization   The Agreement for United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration founding document was signed by 44 countries in the White House in Washington  November 9  1943  UNRRA was headed by a Director General  and governed by a Council  composed of representatives of all state parties  with a Central Committee representing the United States  Britain  China  and the Soviet Union  The other countries who signed the agreement included  Australia  Belgium  Bolivia  Brazil  Canada  Chile  Colombia  Costa Rica  Cuba  Czechoslovakia  Dominican Republic  Ecuador  Egypt  El Salvador  Ethiopia  the French Committee of National Liberation  Greece  Guatemala  Haiti  Honduras  Iceland  India  Iran  Iraq  Liberia  Luxembourg  Mexico  Netherlands  New Zealand  Nicaragua  Norway  Panama  Paraguay  Peru  Philippines  Poland  South Africa  Uruguay  Venezuela  and Yugoslavia  Although the UNRRA was called a  United Nations  agency  it was established prior to the founding of the United Nations  The explanation for this is that the term  United Nations  was used at the time to refer to the Allies of World War II  having been originally coined for that purpose by Roosevelt in 1942   Although initially restricted by its constitution to render aid only to nationals from the United Nations  the Allies   this was changed late in 1944  in response to pleas from Jewish organizations who were concerned with the fate of surviving Jews of German nationality  to also include  other persons who have been obliged to leave their country or place of origin or former residence or who have been deported therefrom by action of the enemy because of race  religion or activities  in favor of the United Nations    UNRRA operated in occupied Germany  primarily in camps for Displaced Persons  especially the 11 000 000 non Germans who had been moved into Germany during the war  but did not render assistance to ethnic Germans   In Asia the organization provided assistance in China and Taiwan  Allegations of fraud or corruption in UNRRA were rare  but there were allegations of misappropriation of the aid by the Kuomintang  Chinese Nationalist Party    UNRRA Headquarters was in Washington  D C   and the European Regional Office was set up in London  The organization was subject to the authority of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces  SHAEF  in Europe and was directed by three Americans during the four years of its existence  Its first director general was Herbert Lehman  1 January 1944 to 31 March 1946   former governor of New York  He was succeeded by Fiorello La Guardia  1 April to 31 December 1946   former mayor of New York – who later learned that that his sister  Gemma LaGuardia Gluck  and other relatives had been imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps  LaGuardia was  in turn  followed by Major General Lowell Ward Rooks  1 January 1947 to 30 September 1948    2  Operations  44 nations contributed to funding  supplying  and staffing the agency  of which the United States was the leading donor  The largest recipients of UNRRA commodity aid  in millions of US dollars were China  $518  Poland $478  Italy $418  Yugoslavia $416  Greece $347  Czechoslovakia $261  Ukraine  USSR  $188  and Austria $136  Hitchcock 2008 concludes that UNRRA was not perfect  for it was troubled by inefficiency  poor planning  shortages of supplies  and some incompetent personnel  On balance however  he argues  it was a major success in terms of delivering aid  food  and medicine  and helping Europe on the path to recovery  especially Eastern and Southern Europe   3  See also  CARE  CRALOG  Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration  GARIOA  4  References  5  Movies  The
