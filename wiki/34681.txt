The Thirteen Colonies were the British colonies on the Atlantic coast of North America founded between 1607  Virginia  and 1733  Georgia   Individual colonies began collaborating at the Albany Congress of 1754 to demand more rights and set up a Continental Congress in 1774 that declared independence from Great Britain in 1776 and formed a new nation  the United States of America  The thirteen colonies were  Delaware  Pennsylvania  New Jersey  Georgia  Connecticut  Massachusetts Bay  Maryland  South Carolina  New Hampshire  Virginia  New York  North Carolina  and Rhode Island and Providence Plantations  Massachusetts  Rhode Island  Connecticut and New Jersey were formed by mergers of previous colonies  All the colonies had similar political and legal systems  with a high degree of self government  Most white men could and did vote for local and legislative officials  The colonies were all prosperous and had high growth rates based on immigration from Britain and Germany  together with ample food supplies and land for new settlers  Most families operated subsistence farms  All the colonies had legal slavery  with slave based plantations in the South producing valuable exports such as tobacco and rice  The Northern and Middle colonies concentrated on trade  The frontier districts often confronted Indian wars  but by 1700 the colonists greatly outnumbered the Indians  The British officials in London practiced a policy of mercantilism  and believed the colonies should be operated for the benefit of the mother country  while the colonists after 1760 resisted British demands for more control especially over taxes  The colonies were religiously diverse  though overwhelmingly Protestant with the Anglican Church of England officially established in most of the South  but there were no bishops and the churches had only local roles  Education was widespread in the northern colonies  which had established colleges such as Harvard and Yale  while the College of William and Mary trained the elite in Virginia   1  The Thirteen Colonies  Each of the thirteen colonies developed its own system of self government  based largely on independent farmers who owned their own land  voted for their local and provincial government  and served on local juries  In some of the colonies  especially Virginia  the Carolinas and Georgia  there were also substantial populations of African slaves  Following a series of protests over taxes in the 1760s and 1770s  these colonies united politically and militarily in opposition to the British government and fought the American Revolutionary War  1775–1783  In 1776  they declared their independence  and achieved that goal with the signing of the Treaty of Paris  1783    Before independence  the thirteen were among two dozen separate colonies in British America  Those in the British West Indies  Newfoundland  the Province of Quebec  Nova Scotia  Bermuda  and East and West Florida remained loyal to the crown throughout the war  although Spain reconquered Florida before the war was over   Although there was a degree of sympathy with the Patriot cause in several of them  their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation  Especially in the case of Quebec and Florida  the British crown had only recently acquired those lands  and many of the issues facing the Thirteen Colonies did not apply to them   2  Growth  Image British Colonies in North America c1750 v2 png British colonies in North America    1  Newfoundland

in 1685 by a decree from King James II that consolidated Maine  New Hampshire  Massachusetts Bay Colony  Plymouth Colony  Rhode Island  Connecticut  Province of New York  East Jersey  and West Jersey into a single larger colony  The experiment collapsed after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89  and the nine former colonies re established their separate identities in 1689   Massachusetts Bay Colony   Settled in 1630 by Puritans from England  The colonial charter was revoked in 1684  and a new charter establishing an enlarged Province of Massachusetts Bay was issued in 1691   Province of Maine   Settled in 1622  An earlier attempt to settle the Popham Colony in Sagadahoc  Maine  near present day Phippsburg and Popham Beach State Park  in 1607 was abandoned after only one year   The Massachusetts Bay Colony claimed the Maine territory  then limited to present day southernmost Maine  in the 1650s  Parts of Maine east of the Kennebec River were also part of New York in the second half of the 17th century  These areas were formally made part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the charter of 1691   Plymouth Colony   Settled in 1620 by the Pilgrims  Plymouth was merged into the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the charter of 1691   Saybrook Colony   Founded in 1635 and merged with Connecticut Colony in 1644   New Haven Colony   Settled in late 1637  New Haven was absorbed by Connecticut Colony with the issuance of the Connecticut Charter in 1662  partly as royal punishment by King Charles II for harboring the regicide judges who sentenced King Charles I to death   East Jersey and West Jersey   Settled as part of New Netherland in the 1610s  New Jersey was captured  along with New York  by English forces in 1664  New Jersey was divided into two separate colonies in 1674  which were reunited in 1702   Province of Carolina   Founded in 1663  Carolina colony was divided into two colonies  North Carolina and South Carolina  in 1712  Both colonies became royal colonies in 1729   4  Population   Note  the population figures are estimates by historians  they do not include the native tribes outside the jurisdiction of the colonies  they do include Natives living under colonial control  as well as slaves and indentured servants    By 1776 about 85% of the white population was of English  Irish  Scottish or Welsh descent  with 9% of German origin and 4% Dutch  These populations continued to grow at a rapid rate throughout the 18th century primarily because of high birth rates  and relatively low death rates  Immigration was a minor factor from 1774 to 1830  Over 90% were farmers  with several small cities that were also seaports linking the colonial economy to the larger British Empire   4 1  Slaves  Slavery was legal and practiced in each of the Thirteen Colonies  In most places it involved house servants or farm workers  It was of economic importance in the export oriented tobacco plantations of Virginia and Maryland  and the rice and indigo plantations of South Carolina  About 287 000 slaves were imported into the Thirteen Colonies  or 2% of the 12 million slaves brought across from Africa  The great majority went to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil  where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished  Life expectancy was much higher in the U S  Combined with a very high birth rate  the numbers grew rapidly by excesses of births over deaths  reaching nearly 4 million by the 1860 census  From 1770 until 1860  the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe  and was nearly twice as rapid as that of England  However  Tadman attributes this to very high birth rates   U S  slaves  then  reached similar rates of natural increase to whites not because of any special privileges but through a process of great suffering and material deprivation    5  Government  British settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system  yet by doing so without a land owning aristocracy they created a broad electorate and a pattern of free and frequent elections that put a premium on voter participation  The colonies offered a much broader franchise than England or indeed any other country  White men with enough property could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature  and in Connecticut and Rhode Island they could even vote for governor  Legitimacy for a voter meant having an  interest  in society – as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716   it is necessary and reasonable  that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly   Women  children  indentured servants and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head  The main legal criterion for having an  interest  was ownership of property  which was narrowly based in Britain  and nineteen out of twenty men were controlled politically by their landlords  London insisted on it for the colonies  telling governors to exclude men who were not freeholders  that is  did not own land  from the ballot  Nevertheless land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the white men were eligible to vote   The colonial political culture emphasized deference  so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen  But sometimes they competed with each other  and had to appeal to the common man for votes  There were no political parties  and would be legislators formed ad hoc coalitions of their families  friends  and neighbors  Outside Puritan New England  election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry  politick  shake hands with the grandees  and meet old friends  hear the speeches and all the while toasting  eating  treating  tippling  gaming and gambling  They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk  as supporters cheered or booed  Candidate George Washington spent £39 for treats for his supporters  The candidates knew they had to  swill the planters with bumbo  rum    Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints relaxed   The actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males  The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York  where long standing factions  based on ethnic and religious groups  mobilized supporters at a higher rate  New York and Rhode Island developed long lasting two faction systems that held together for years at the colony level  but did not reach into local affairs  The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections  however  had little basis in policy or ideology  Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl  and based on personality rather than long lived factions or serious disputes on issues   The colonies were independent of each other before 1774 as efforts led by Benjamin Franklin to form a colonial union through the Albany Congress of 1754 had failed  The thirteen all had well established systems of self government and elections based on the Rights of Englishmen  which they were determined to protect from imperial interference  The vast majority of white men were eligible to vote   5 1  Economic policy  The British Empire at the time operated under the mercantile system  where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire  and trade with other empires was forbidden  The goal was to enrich Britain—its merchants and its government  Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London  but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies   Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth  to the exclusion of other empires  The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers  regulations  and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm  The government had to fight smuggling—which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French  Spanish or Dutch  The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses  so that gold and silver would pour into London  The government took its share through duties and taxes  with the remainder going to merchants in Britain  The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy  which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires  and sometimes seized them  Thus the British Navy captured New Amsterdam  New York  in 1664  The colonies were captive markets for British industry  and the goal was to enrich the mother country   5 2  Legislation prior to 1763  Britain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French  Spanish or Dutch empires using the Navigation Acts  which Americans avoided as often as they could  The royal officials responded to smuggling with open ended search warrants  Writs of Assistance   In 1761  Boston lawyer James Otis argued that the writs violated the constitutional rights of the colonists  He lost the case  but John Adams later wrote   Then and there the child Independence was born    However  the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade  they only opposed legislation which was thought to impact them internally   On December 1  1763  at Hanover Courthouse  Patrick Henry argued the Parson s Cause in the Colony of Virginia  where the legislature had passed a law and it was vetoed by the king  Henry argued   that a King  by disallowing Acts of this salutary nature  from being the father of his people  degenerated into a Tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects  obedience    Following their victory in the French and Indian War in 1763  Great Britain took control of the French holdings in North America  outside the Caribbean  The British sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French  and keep them separated from the American frontiersmen  To this end  the Royal Proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains as this was designated an Indian Reserve  Disregarding the proclamation  some groups of settlers continued to move west and establish farms  The proclamation was soon modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement  but the fact that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation angered the colonists   5 3  Coming of American revolution  Beginning with the intense protests over the Stamp Act of 1765  the Americans insisted on the principle of  no taxation without representation   representation being understood in the context of Parliament directly levying the duty or excise tax  and thus by passing the colonial legislatures  which had levied taxes on the colonies in the monarch s stead prior to 1763  They argued that  as the colonies had no representation in the British Parliament  it was a violation of their rights as Englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them  Those other British colonies that had assemblies largely agreed with those in the Thirteen Colonies  but they were thoroughly controlled by the British Empire and the Royal Navy  so protests were hopeless   Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes  Trouble escalated over the tea tax  as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea and in Boston  dumped the tea in the harbor during the Boston Tea Party in 1773  Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the Intolerable Acts  which  among other things  greatly restricted self government in the colony of Massachusetts  In response the colonies formed extralegal bodies of elected representatives  generally known as Provincial Congresses  Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise  Later in 1774 twelve colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia  During the Second Continental Congress the thirteenth colony  Georgia  sent delegates  By spring 1775 all royal officials had been expelled from all thirteen colonies  The Continental Congress served as a de facto national government through the war that raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander  made treaties  declared independence  and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states   6  Other British colonies  At the time of the war Britain had seven other colonies on the Atlantic coast of North America  Newfoundland  Rupert s Land  the area around the Hudson Bay   Nova Scotia  Prince Edward Island  East Florida  West Florida  and the Province of Quebec  There were other colonies in the Americas as well  largely in the British West Indies  These colonies remained loyal to the crown   Newfoundland stayed loyal to Britain without question  It was exempt from the Navigation Acts and shared none of the grievances of the continental colonies  It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances   Nova Scotia had a large Yankee element that had recently arrived from New England  and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men  The royal government in Halifax reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of  neutrality   In any case  the island like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible   Quebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade  The Quebec Act of 1774 gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire  and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England  The American grievances over taxation had little relevance  and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances  Even so the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to capture Canada in 1775  Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause   In the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica  Grenada  and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation  but the others were quite loyal  Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations  many of whom lived in London   in turn the planters  greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts  The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands  During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships   In Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports  There was increasing sympathy for the American cause  including smuggling  and both colonies were considered  passive allies  of the United States throughout the war  When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder  the colony gave no resistance at all   East Florida and West Florida were territories transferred to Britain during the French and Indian War from Spain by treaty  The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers  After 1775  East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South  especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina  However  Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781  then recovered both territories in the Treaty of Paris that ended the war in 1783  Spain ultimately transferred the Florida provinces to the United States in 1819   7  See also  American Revolution  Atlantic history  British colonization of the Americas  Colonial American military
