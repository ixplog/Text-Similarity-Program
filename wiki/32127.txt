Society and a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist John D  Rockefeller on land donated by Marshall Field  Organized as an independent institution legally  it replaced the first Baptist university of the same name  which had closed in 1886 due to extended financial and leadership problems  William Rainey Harper became the modern university s first president on July 1  1891  and the university opened for classes on October 1  1892   The business school was founded in 1898  and the law school was founded in 1902  Harper died in 1906  and was replaced by a succession of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929  During this period  the Oriental Institute was founded to support and interpret archeological work in what was then called the Near East   In the 1890s  the University of Chicago  fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students  affiliated with several regional colleges and universities  Des Moines College  Kalamazoo College  Butler University  and Stetson University  Under the terms of the affiliation  the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the University  to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals  to make no faculty appointment without the university s approval  and to send copies of examinations for suggestions  The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years  and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago  A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago  and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work  The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost  special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses  and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost  The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice  Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program  as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part  and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the University  The program passed into history by 1910   1 2  1920s–1980s  In 1929  the university s fifth president  Robert Maynard Hutchins  took office  the university underwent many changes during his 24 year tenure  Hutchins eliminated varsity football from the university in an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics  instituted the undergraduate college s liberal arts curriculum known as the Common Core  and organized the university s graduate work into its current four divisions  In 1933  Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University into a single university  During his term  the University of Chicago Hospitals  now called the University of Chicago Medical Center  finished construction and enrolled its first medical students  Also  the Committee on Social Thought  an institution distinctive of the university  was created   Money that had been raised during the 1920s and financial backing from the Rockefeller Foundation helped the school to survive through the Great Depression  During World War II  the university made important contributions to the Manhattan Project  The university was the site of the first isolation of plutonium and of the creation of the first artificial  self sustained nuclear reaction by Enrico Fermi in 1942   In the early 1950s  student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood  In response  the university became a major sponsor of a controversial urban renewal project for Hyde Park  which profoundly affected both the neighborhood s architecture and street plan   The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s  beginning in 1962  when students occupied President George Beadle s office in a protest over the university s off campus rental policies  After continued turmoil  a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the Kalven Report  The report  a two page statement of the university s policy in  social and political action   declared that  To perform its mission in the society  a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions  passions  and pressures   The report has since been used to justify decisions such as the university s refusal to divest from South Africa in the 1980s and Darfur in the late 2000s   In 1969  more than 400 students  angry about the dismissal of a popular professor  Marlene Dixon  occupied the Administration Building for two weeks  After the sit in ended  when Dixon turned down a one year reappointment  42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended  the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement   In 1978  Hanna Holborn Gray  then the provost and acting president of Yale University  became President of the University of Chicago  a position she held for 15 years   1 3  1990s–2010s  In 1999  then President Hugo Sonnenschein announced plans to relax the university s famed core curriculum  reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15  When The New York Times  The Economist  and other major news outlets picked up this story  the university became the focal point of a national debate on education  The changes were ultimately implemented  but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein s decision to resign in 2000   In the past decade  the university began a number of multi million dollar expansion projects  In 2008  the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the Milton Friedman Institute which attracted both support and controversy from faculty members and The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the Chicago Theological Seminary  During the same year  investor David G  Booth donated $300 million to the university s Booth School of Business  which is the largest gift in the university s history and the largest gift ever to any business school  In 2009  planning or construction on several new buildings  half of which cost $100 million or more  was underway   Since 2009  a two billion dollar campaign has brought substantial expansion to the campus  including the unveiling of the Max Palevsky Residential Commons  the South Campus Residence Hall  the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center  a new hospital  and a new science building  Since 2011  major construction projects have included the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery  a ten story medical research center  and further additions to the medical campus of the University of Chicago Medical Center   On May 1  2014  Barack Obama s White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault publicly named the University of Chicago as one of many higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights  for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints    Fourth year Olivia Ortiz filed the original complaint on the claim that the University had mishandled disciplinary procedures after she was sexually assaulted by her then partner  who has since graduated  over the course of the 2011–2012 academic year  OCR accepted her case in June 2013  based both on the content of Ortiz’s original complaint and on the Maroon Sexual Assault Investigative series from fall 2012  which was cited in the original complaint   The complaint was reported originally by the Chicago Maroon in a 2012 student newspaper investigation of University of Chicago s history of under reporting and mishandling sexual violence complaints filed by students since 2007   2  Campus  The main campus of the University of Chicago

including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle  a complex designed by Saarinen   a series of arts buildings  a building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the university s School of Social Service Administration   a building which is to become the home of the Harris School of Public Policy Studies by Edward Durrell Stone  and the Regenstein Library  the largest building on campus  a brutalist
