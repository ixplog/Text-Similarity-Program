Medical psychology is the application of psychological principles to the practice of medicine for both physical and mental disorders  The American Psychological Association  APA  defines medical psychology as  that branch of psychology that integrates somatic and psychotherapeutic modalities into the management of mental illness and emotional  cognitive  behavioral and substance use disorders   A medical psychologist does not automatically equate with a psychologist who has the authority to prescribe medication  Psychologists who hold prescriptive authority for specific psychiatric medications such as antidepressants and other pharmaceutical drugs must first obtain specific qualifications in Psychopharmacology   Medical psychologists apply psychological theories  scientific psychological findings  and techniques of psychotherapy  behavior modification  cognitive  interpersonal  family  and life style therapy to improve the psychological and physical health of the patient  Psychologists with post doctoral specialty training as medical psychologists are the practitioners with refined skills in clinical observation in of the field of psychology  learning  central nervous system adaptation and change  and adaptation and lifestyle change applying a number of different methods in several different mediums of treatment  Highly qualified and post graduate specialized doctors are trained for service in primary care centers  hospitals  residential care centers  and long term care facilities and in multidisciplinary collaboration and team treatment  They are trained and equipped to modify physical disease states and the actual cytoarchitecture and functioning of the central nervous and related systems using psychological and pharmacological techniques  when allowed by statute   and to provide prevention for the progression of disease having to do with poor personal and life style choices and conceptualization  behavioral patterns  and chronic exposure to the effects of negative thinking  choosing  attitudes  and negative contexts   1  Behavioral medicine  Behavioral medicine  related to behavioral health  clinical health psychology and psychosomatic medicine  is a related branch of clinical practice in which psychologists emphasize the biopsychosocial approach to medicine  a model which recognizes the importance of addressing the interaction between physical  psychological and social factors in both the prevention and management of disease  Practitioners of behavioral medicine differ from medical psychologists in that they focus on the scientific application of behavioral interventions to a wide variety of medical conditions  e g   asthma  gastrointestinal illnesses  cardiac conditions  spinal cord and brain injuries  chronic pain  headaches  and addictive illness    2  Certifications  The Academy of Medical Psychology defines medical psychology as a specialty trained at the post doctoral level and designed to deliver advanced diagnostic and clinical interventions in Medical and Healthcare Facilities utilizing the knowledge and skills of clinical psychology  health psychology  behavioral medicine  psychopharmacology and basic medical science  The Academy of Medical Psychology makes a distinction between the Psychopharmacologist who is a psychologist with advanced training in psychopharmacology and may prescribe medicine or consult with physician or nurse practitioner prescribers to diagnose mental illness and select and recommend appropriate psychoactive medicines  and the Medical Psychologists who are prepared to do the psychopharmacology consulting or prescribing  but also must have training which prepares them for functioning with Behavioral and Lifestyle components of physical disease and functioning in or in consultation with multidisciplinary healthcare teams in Primary Care Centers or Community Hospitals in addition to traditional roles in the treatment of mental illness and substance abuse disorders  The specialty of Medical Psychology and this distinction from Psychopharmacologist is recognized by the National Alliance of Professional Psychology Providers  the psychology national practitioner association  see www nappp org    A specialty of medical psychology has established a specialty board certification  American Board of Medical Psychology and an Academy of Medical Psychology requiring a doctorate degree in psychology and extensive post doctoral training in the specialty and the passage of an oral or written examination   Although the Academy of Medical Psychology defines medical psychology as a  specialty  and has established a  specialty board certification   and is recognized by the national psychology practitioner association  www nappp org  there is a split in national psychology associations between NAPPP and APA and the American Psychological Association and the National Alliance of Professional Psychology Providers do not currently recognize the same specialties with the APA being a group that represents scientists  academics  and practitioners  as a minority  and NAPPP being an organization that represents only practitioners  However  Louisiana does recognize and restricts the term and practice of medical psychology by statute  the Medical Psychology Practice Act  as a  profession of the health sciences  with prescriptive authority  It is equally important to note than the American Psychological Association does not recognize that the term medical psychology has  as a prerequisite  nor should the term be equated with having  prescriptive authority   In 2006  the American Psychological Association  APA  recommended that the education and training of psychologists  who are specifically pursuing one of several prerequisites for prescribing medication  integrate instruction in the biological sciences  clinical medicine and pharmacology into a formalized program of postdoctoral education  In 2009  the National Alliance of Professional Providers in Psychology recognized the education and training specified by the American Board of Medical Psychology  www amphome org  ABMP  and the Academy of Medical Psychology as the approved standards for post graduate training and examination and qualifications in the nationally recognized specialty in Medical Psychology  Since then numerous hospitals  primary care centers  and other health facilities have recognized the ABMP standards and qualifications for privileges in healthcare facilities and verification of specialty status   The following Clinical Competencies are identified as essential in the education and training of psychologists  wishing to pursue prescriptive authority  These recommended prerequisites are not required or specifically recommended by APA for the training and education of medical psychologists not pursuing prerequisites for prescribing medication    I  Basic Science  anatomy  & physiology  biochemistry   II  Neurosciences  neuroanatomy  neurophysiology  neurochemistry   III  Physical Assessment and Laboratory Exams  physical assessment  laboratory and radiological assessment  medical terminology   IV  Clinical Medicine and Pathophysiology  pathophysiology with emphasis on the principal physiological systems  clinical medicine  differential diagnosis  clinical correlation and case studies  chemical dependency  chronic pain management   V  Clinical and Research Pharmacology and Psychopharmacology  pharmacology  clinical pharmacology  pharmacogenetics  psychopharmacology  developmental psychopharmacology   VI  Clinical Pharmacotherapeutics  professional  ethical and legal issues  combined therapies and their interactions  computer based aids to practice  pharmacoepidemiology   VII  Research  methodology and design of psychopharmacology research  interpretation and evaluation  FDA drug development and other regulatory processes   The 2006 APA recommendations also include supervised clinical experience intended to integrate the above seven knowledge domains and assess competencies in skills and applied knowledge   The national psychology practitioner association  NAPPP  www nappp org  and top national certifying body  Academy of Medical Psychology  www amphome org  have established the national training  examination  and specialty practice criterion and guidelines in the specialty of Medical Psychology and have established a national journal in the specialty  Such certifying bodies  view psychopharmacology training  either to prescribe or consult  as one component of the training of a specialist in Medical Psychology  but recognize that training and specialized skills in other aspects of the treatment of behavioral aspects of medical illness  and mental illness affecting physical illness is essential to practice at the specialty level in Medical Psychology  The Louisiana Academy of Medical Psychology  LAMP   currently the largest organization of psychologists with prescriptive authority in the world and the only organization representing practitioners of medical psychology in Louisiana as defined by Louisiana statute within any jurisdiction in the United States  no longer recognizes the Academy of Medical Psychology as an adequate certifying body for its practitioners  and its members have resigned from the Academy of Medical Psychology en masse  Similarly  virtually all members of LAMP have also resigned from the Louisiana Psychological Association  LPA  after many LPA members uncovered that the LAMP s prescriptive authority movement covertly came to an agreement with Louisiana s medical board to transfer the entire practice of psychology for psychologists with prescriptive authority to the medical board   3  References  4  See also  Prescriptive authority for psychologists movement  Health psychology  Psychiatry  5  External links    www health psych org MedPsych cfm    division55 org  American
