Old Prussian is an extinct Baltic language  once spoken by the Old Prussians  the indigenous peoples of Prussia  not to be confused with the later and much larger German state of the same name   now northeastern Poland and the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia   The language is called Old Prussian to avoid confusion with the German dialects Low Prussian and High Prussian  and the adjective Prussian  which is also often used to relate to the later German state   Old Prussian began to be written down in the Latin alphabet in about the 13th century  A small amount of literature in the language survives   1  Original territory  In addition to Prussia proper  the original territory of the Old Prussians might have included eastern parts of Pomerelia  some parts of the region east of the Vistula River   The language might have also been spoken much further east and south in what became Polesia and part of Podlasie with the conquests by Rus and Poles starting in the 10th century and by the German colonisation of the area that began in the 12th century    2  Relation to other languages  Old Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western Baltic languages  Curonian  Galindian and Sudovian  It is more distantly related to the surviving Eastern Baltic languages  Lithuanian and Latvian  Compare the Old Prussian semmē  Latvian zeme and Lithuanian žemė   Old Prussian contained loanwords from Slavic languages  e g  Old Prussian curtis  hound  just as Lithuanian kùrtas  Latvian kur̃ts come from Slavic  cf  Ukrainian хорт  khort  Polish chart  Czech chrt   as well as a few borrowings from German  including Gothic  e g  Old Prussian ylo  awl  as with Lithuanian ýla  Latvian īlens  and even Scandinavian languages   In addition to the German colonists  groups of people from Poland  Lithuania  France  Scotland  England  and Austria  found refuge in Prussia during the Protestant Reformation and thereafter  Such immigration caused a slow decline in the use of Old Prussian  as the Prussians adopted the languages of the others  particularly German  the language of the German government of Prussia  Baltic Old Prussian probably ceased to be spoken around the beginning of the 18th century due to many of its remaining speakers dying in the famines and bubonic plague epidemics harrowing the East Prussian countryside and towns from 1709 until 1711  The regional dialect of Low German spoken in Prussia  or East Prussia   Low Prussian  preserved a number of Baltic Prussian words  such as kurp  from the Old Prussian kurpi  for shoe  in contrast to the standard German Schuh    Until the 1930s  when the Nazi government began a program of Germanization  and 1945  when the Soviets annexed Prussia  one could find Old Prussian river and place names in East Prussia  like Tawe  Tawelle  and Tawelninken   3  Monuments  3 1  Lord s Prayer  Lord s Prayer in Lithuanian dialect of Nadruvia  corrupted  Simon Prätorius   3 2  A list of monuments of Old Prussian  Prussian language geographical names within the territory of  Baltic  Prussia  The first basic study of these names was by Georg Gerullis  in Die altpreußischen Ortsnamen   The Old Prussian Place names    written and published with the help of Walter de Gruyter  in 1922   Prussian personal names   Separate words found in various historical documents   Vernacularisms in the former German dialects of East and West Prussia  as well as words of Old Curonian origin in Latvian  and West Baltic vernacularisms in Lithuanian and Belarusian   The so called Basel Epigram  the oldest written Prussian sentence  1369   It reads   Various fragmentary texts   Beigeite beygeyte peckolle   Run  run  devils     Kails naussen gnigethe   Hello our friend     Kails poskails ains par antres – a

fragment of the first words of the Pater Noster in Prussian  from the beginning of the 15th century  Towe Nüsze kås esse andangonsün swyntins   100 words  in strongly varying versions  of the by a friar Simon Grunau  a historian of the Teutonic Knights  written ca  1517–1526 in his Preussische Chronik  Apart from those words Grunau also recorded an expression sta nossen rickie  nossen rickie   This  is  our lord  our lord     The so called   which consists of 802 thematically sorted words and their German equivalents  The manuscript was copied by Peter Holcwesscher from Marienburg in around 1400  and the original is dated at the beginning of the 14th or the end of the 13th century  It was found in 1825 by Fr  Neumann among other manuscripts acquired by him from the heritage of the Elbing merchant A  Grübnau  it was thus dubbed the Codex Neumannianus   The three Catechisms printed in Königsberg in 1545  1545  and 1561 respectively  The first two consist of only 6 pages of text in Old Prussian – the second one being a correction of the first into another Old Prussian dialect  The third catechism  or Enchiridion  consists of 132 pages of text  and is a translation of Luther s Small Catechism by a German cleric called Abel Will  with his Prussian assistant Paul Megott  Will himself new little or no Old Prussian  and his Prussian interpreter was probably illiterate  but according to Will speaking Old Prussian quite well  The text itself is mainly a word for word translation  and Will phonetically recorded Megott s oral translation  Due to this fact  Enchiridion exhibits many irregularities  such as the lack of case agreement in phrases involving an article and a noun  which followed word for word German originals as opposed to native Old Prussian syntax   Commonly thought of as Prussian  but probably actually Lithuanian  at least the adage  however  has been argued to be genuinely West Baltic  only an otherwise unattested dialect    An adage of 1583  Dewes does dantes  Dewes does geitka  the form does in the second instance corresponds to Lithuanian future tense duos   will give    Trencke  trencke    Strike  Strike     4  Grammar  With other monuments being merely word lists  the grammar of Old Prussian is reconstructed chiefly on the basis of the three Catechisms  There is no consensus on the number of cases that Old Prussian had  and at least four can be determined with certainty  nominative  genitive  accusative and dative  with different desinences  There are traces of a vocative case  such as in the phrase O Deiwe Rikijs  Oh God the Lord   reflecting the inherited PIE vocative ending * e  There was a definite article  stas m   sta f    three genders  masculine  feminine and neuter  and two numbers  singular and plural  Declensional classes were a stems  ā stems  feminine   ē stems  feminine   i stems  u stems  ī jā stems  jā ijā stems and consonant stems  Present  future and past tense are attested  as well as optative forms  imperative  permissive   infinitive  and four participles  active passive present past    5  Revived Old Prussian  A few experimental communities involved in reviving a reconstructed form of the language now exist in Lithuania  Russia  Poland  and other countries  About 200 people have learned the language and are attempting to use it in as many everyday activities as possible   Important in this revival was Vytautas Mažiulis  who died on 11 April 2009  and his pupil Letas Palmaitis  leader of the experiment and author of the web site Prussian Reconstructions  Two late contributors should be mentioned specially  Prāncis Arellis  Pranciškus Erelis   Lithuania  and Dailūns Russinis  Dailonis Rusiņš   Latvia  After them Twankstas Glabbis from Kaliningrad oblast and Nērtiks Pamedīns from Polish Warmia Mazuria actively joined   6  References  7  Literature  Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann    Königsberg  1871   G  H  F  Nesselmann    Berlin  1873   E  Berneker  Die preussische
