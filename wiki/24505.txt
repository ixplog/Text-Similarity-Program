Phospholipids are a class of lipids that are a major component of all cell membranes as they can form lipid bilayers  Most phospholipids contain a diglyceride  a phosphate group  and a simple organic molecule such as choline  one exception to this rule is sphingomyelin  which is derived from sphingosine instead of glycerol  The first phospholipid identified as such in biological tissues was lecithin  or phosphatidylcholine  in the egg yolk  by Theodore Nicolas Gobley  a French chemist and pharmacist  in 1847  The structure of the phospholipid molecule generally consists of hydrophobic tails and a hydrophilic head  Biological membranes in eukaryotes also contain another class of lipid  sterol  interspersed among the phospholipids and together they provide membrane fluidity and mechanical strength  Purified phospholipids are produced commercially and have found applications in nanotechnology and materials science   1  Amphipathic character  The  head  is hydrophilic  attracted to water   while the hydrophobic  tails  are repelled by water and are forced to aggregate  The hydrophilic head contains the negatively charged phosphate group  and glycerol  The hydrophobic tail usually consists of 2 long fatty acid hydrocarbon chains  When placed in water  phospholipids form a variety of structures depending on the specific properties of the phospholipid  These specific properties allow phospholipids to play an important role in the phospholipid bilayer  In biological systems  the phospholipids often occur with other molecules  e g   proteins  glycolipids  sterols  in a bilayer such as a cell membrane  Lipid bilayers occur when hydrophobic tails line up against one another  forming a membrane of hydrophilic heads on both sides facing the water   Such movement can be described by the fluid mosaic model  that describes the membrane as a mosaic of lipid molecules that act as a solvent for all the substances and proteins within it  so proteins and lipid molecules are then free to diffuse laterally through the lipid matrix and migrate over the membrane  Sterols contribute to membrane fluidity by hindering the packing together of phospholipids  However  this model has now been superseded  as through the study of lipid polymorphism it is now known that the behaviour of lipids under physiological  and other  conditions is not

liposomal  ethosomal and other nanoformulations of topical  oral and parenteral drugs for differing reasons like improved bio availability  reduced toxicity and increased penetration  Ethosomal formulation of ketoconazole using Phospholipids showed good entrapment efficiency  stability profile and is a promising option for transdermal delivery with potential for topical application in fungal infections  Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed Phospholipid chains with surfactant properties   3  Simulations  Computational simulations of phospholipids are often performed using molecular dynamics with force fields such as GROMOS  CHARMM  or AMBER   4  Characterization  Phospholipids are optically highly birefringent  i e  their refractive index is different along their axis as opposed to perpendicular to it  Measurement of birefringence can be achieved using cross polarisers in a microscope to obtain an image of e g  vesicle walls or using techniques such as dual polarisation interferometry to quantify lipid order or disruption in supported bilayers   4 1  Analysis  There are no simple methods available for analysis of Phospholipids since the close range of polarity between different phospholipid species makes detection difficult  Oil chemists often use spectroscopy to determine total Phosphorus content and then calculate content of Phospholipids based on molecular weight of expected fatty acid species  Lipidomists use more absolute methods of analysis of with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  NMR   particularly 31P NMR  while HPLC ELSD provides relative values   5  Phospholipid synthesis  Phospholipid synthesis occurs in the cytosol adjacent to ER membrane that is studded with proteins that act in synthesis  GPAT and LPAAT acyl transferases  phosphatase and choline phosphotransferase  and allocation  flippase and floppase   Eventually a vesicle will bud off from the ER containing phospholipids destined for the cytoplasmic cellular membrane on its exterior leaflet and phospholipids destined for the exoplasmic cellular membrane on its inner leaflet   6  Sources  Common sources of industrially produced phospholipids are soya  rapeseed  sunflower  chicken eggs  bovine milk  fish eggs etc  Each source has a unique profile of individual phospholipid species and consequently differing applications in food  nutrition  pharmaceuticals  cosmetics and drug delivery   7  In signal transduction  Some types of phospholipid can be split to produce products that function as second messengers in signal transduction  Examples include phosphatidylinositol  4 5  bisphosphate  PIP2   that can be split by the enzyme Phospholipase C into inositol triphosphate  IP3  and diacylglycerol  DAG   which both carry out the functions of the Gq type of G protein in response to various stimuli and intervene in various processes from long term depression in neurons to leukocyte signal pathways started by chemokine receptors   Phospholipids also intervene in prostaglandin signal pathways as the raw material used by lipase enzymes to produce the prostaglandin precursors  In plants they serve as the raw material to produce Jasmonic acid  a plant hormone similar in structure to prostaglandins that mediates defensive responses against pathogens   8  Food technology  Phospholipids can act as an emulsifier  enabling oils to form a colloid with water  Phospholipids are one of the components of lecithin which is found in egg yolks  as well as being extracted from soy beans  and is used as a food additive in many products  and can be purchased as a dietary supplement  Lysolecithins are typically used for WO emulsions like margarine due to their higher HLB ratio   9  Phospholipid
