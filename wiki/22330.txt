The octal numeral system  or oct for short  is the base 8 number system  and uses the digits 0 to 7  Octal numerals can be made from binary numerals by grouping consecutive binary digits into groups of three  starting from the right   For example  the binary representation for decimal 74 is 1001010  which can be grouped into  00 1 001 010 – so the octal representation is 112   In the decimal system each decimal place is a power of ten  For example   In the octal system each place is a power of eight  For example   By performing the calculation above in the familiar decimal system we see why 112 in octal is equal to 64+8+2   74 in decimal   1  Usage  1 1  By Native Americans  The Yuki language in California and the Pamean languages in Mexico have octal systems because the speakers count using the spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves   1 2  By Europeans  It has been suggested that the reconstructed Proto Indo European word for  nine  might be related to the PIE word for  new   Based on this  some have speculated that proto Indo Europeans used an octal number system  though the evidence supporting this is slim   In 1716 King Charles XII of Sweden asked Emanuel Swedenborg to elaborate a number system based on 64 instead of 10  Swedenborg however argued that for people with less intelligence than the king such a big base would be too difficult and instead proposed 8 as the base  In 1718 Swedenborg wrote  but did not publish  a manuscript   En ny rekenkonst som om vexlas wid Thalet 8 i stelle then wanliga wid Thalet 10    A new arithmetic  or art of counting  which changes at the Number 8 instead of the usual at the Number 10    The numbers 1 7 are there denoted by the consonants l  s  n  m  t  f  u  v  and zero by the vowel o  Thus 8    lo   16    so   24    no   64    loo   512    looo  etc  Numbers with consecutive consonants are pronounced with vowel sounds between in accordance with a special rule   Writing under the pseudonym  Hirossa Ap Iccim  in The Gentleman s Magazine   London  July 1745  Hugh Jones proposed an octal system for British coins  weights and measures   Whereas reason and convenience indicate to us an uniform standard for all quantities  which I shall call the Georgian standard  and that is only to divide every integer in each species into eight equal parts  and every part again into 8 real or imaginary particles  as far as is necessary  For tho  all nations count universally by tens  originally occasioned by the number of digits on both hands  yet 8 is a far more complete and commodious number  since it is divisible into halves  quarters  and half quarters  or units  without a fraction  of which subdivision ten is uncapable      In a later treatise on Octave computation  1753  Jones concluded   Arithmetic by Octaves seems most agreeable to the Nature of Things  and therefore may be called Natural Arithmetic in Opposition to that now in Use  by Decades  which may be esteemed Artificial Arithmetic    In 1801  James Anderson criticized the French for basing the Metric system on decimal arithmetic  He suggested base 8 for which he coined the term octal  His work was intended as recreational mathematics  but he suggested a purely octal system of weights and measures and observed that the existing system of English units was already  to a remarkable extent  an octal system   In the mid 19th century  Alfred B  Taylor concluded that  Our octonary  base 8  radix is  therefore  beyond all comparison the  best possible one  for an arithmetical system   The proposal included a graphical notation for the digits and new names for the numbers  suggesting that we should count  un  du  the  fo  pa  se  ki  unty  unty un  unty du  and so on  with successive multiples of eight named  unty  duty  thety  foty  paty  sety  kity and under   So  for example  the number 65 would be spoken in octonary as under un  Taylor also republished some of Swedenborg s work on octonary as an appendix to the above cited publications   1 3  In fiction  In the 2009 film Avatar  the language of the extraterrestrial Na vi race employs an octal numeral system  probably due to the fact that they have four fingers on each hand   In the TV series Stargate SG 1  the Ancients  a race of beings responsible for the invention of the Stargates  used an octal system of mathematics   In the tabletop game series Warhammer 40 000  the Tau race use an octal number system   1 4  In computers  Octal became widely used in computing when systems such as the PDP 8  ICL 1900 and IBM mainframes employed 12 bit  24 bit or 36 bit words  Octal was an ideal abbreviation of binary for these machines because their word size is divisible by three  each octal digit represents three binary digits   So four  eight or twelve digits could concisely display an entire machine word  It also cut costs by allowing Nixie tubes  seven segment displays  and calculators to be used for the operator consoles  where binary displays were too complex to use  decimal displays needed complex hardware to convert radices  and hexadecimal displays needed to display more numerals   All modern computing platforms  however  use 16   32   or 64 bit words  further divided into eight bit bytes  On such systems three octal digits per byte would be required  with the most significant octal digit representing two binary digits  plus one bit of the next significant byte  if any   Octal representation of a 16 bit word requires 6 digits  but the most significant octal digit represents  quite inelegantly  only one bit  0 or 1   This representation offers no way to easily read the most significant byte  because it s smeared over four octal digits  Therefore  hexadecimal is more commonly used in programming languages today  since two hexadecimal digits exactly specify one byte  Some platforms with a power of two word size still have instruction subwords that are more easily understood if displayed in octal  this includes the PDP 11 and Motorola 68000 family  The modern day ubiquitous x86 architecture belongs to this category as well  but octal is rarely used on this platform  although certain properties of the binary encoding of opcodes become more readily apparent when displayed in octal  e g  the ModRM byte  which is divided into fields of 2  3  and 3 bits  so octal can be useful in describing these encodings   Octal is sometimes used in computing instead of hexadecimal  perhaps most often in modern times in conjunction with file permissions under Unix systems  see chmod   It has the advantage of not requiring any extra symbols as digits  the hexadecimal system is base 16 and therefore needs six additional symbols beyond 0–9   It is also used for digital displays   In programming languages  octal literals are typically identified with a variety of prefixes  including the digit 0  the letters o or q  or the digit–letter combination 0o  In Motorola convention  octal numbers are prefixed with @  whereas a small letter o is added as a postfix following the Intel convention  DR DOS DEBUG uses \ to prefix octal numbers   For example  the literal 73  base 8  might be represented as 073  o73  q73  0o73  \73  @73 or 73o in various languages   Newer languages have been abandoning the prefix 0  as decimal numbers are often represented with leading zeroes  The prefix q was introduced to avoid the prefix o being mistaken for a zero  while the prefix 0o was introduced to avoid starting a numerical literal with an alphabetic character  like o or q   since these might cause the literal to be confused with a variable name  The prefix 0o also follows the model set by the prefix 0x used for hexadecimal literals in the C language  it is supported by Haskell  OCaml  Perl 6  Python as of version 3 0  Ruby  Tcl as of version 9  and it is intended to be supported by ECMAScript 6  the prefix 0 has been discouraged in ECMAScript 3 and dropped in ECMAScript 5    Octal numbers that are used in some programming languages  C  Perl  PostScript…  for textual graphical representations of byte strings when some byte values  unrepresented in a code page  non graphical  having special meaning in current context or otherwise undesired  have to be to escaped as \nnn  Octal representation of non ASCII bytes may be particularly handy with UTF 8  where any start byte has octal value \3nn and any continuation byte has octal value \2nn   2  Conversion between bases  2 1  Decimal to octal conversion  2 1 1  Method of successive Euclidean division by 8  To convert integer decimals to octal  divide the original number by the largest possible power of 8 and divide the remainders by successively smaller powers of 8 until the power is 1  The octal representation is formed by the quotients  written in the order generated by the algorithm  For example  to convert 12510 to octal   Therefore  12510   1758   Another example   Therefore  90010   16048   2 1 2  Method of successive multiplication by 8  To convert a decimal fraction to octal  multiply by 8  the integer part of the result is the first digit of the octal fraction  Repeat the process with the fractional part of the result  until it is null or within acceptable error bounds   Example  Convert 0 1640625 to octal   Therefore  0 164062510   0 1248   These two methods can be combined to handle decimal numbers with both integer and fractional parts  using the first on the integer part and the second on the fractional part   2 2  Octal to decimal conversion  To convert a number to decimal  use the formula that defines its base 8 representation   In this formula  is an individual octal digit being converted  where is the position of the digit  counting from 0 for the right most digit    Example  Convert 7648 to decimal   For double digit octal numbers this method amounts to multiplying the lead digit by 8 and adding the second digit to get the total   Example  658   6 × 8 + 5   5310  2 3  Octal to binary conversion  To convert octal to binary  replace each octal digit by its binary representation   Example  Convert 518 to binary   Therefore  518   101 0012   2 4  Binary to octal conversion  The process is the reverse of the previous algorithm  The binary digits are grouped by threes  starting from the least significant bit and proceeding to the left and to the right  Add leading 0s  or trailing zeros to the right of decimal point  to fill out the last group of three if necessary  Then replace each trio with the equivalent octal digit   For instance  convert binary 1010111100 to octal      align  center    001    010    111    100    align  center    1    2    7    4     Therefore  10101111002   12748   Convert binary 11100 01001 to octal      align  center    011    100          010    010    align  center    3    4           2    2     Therefore  11100 010012   34 228   2 5  Octal to hexadecimal conversion  The conversion is made in two steps using binary as an intermediate base  Octal is converted to binary and then binary to hexadecimal  grouping digits by fours  which correspond each to a hexadecimal digit   For instance  convert octal 1057 to hexadecimal      align  center    1    0    5    7    align  center    001    000    101    111        align  center    0010    0010    1111    align  center    2    2    F     Therefore  10578   22F16   2 6  Hexadecimal to octal conversion  Hexadecimal to octal conversion proceeds by first converting the hexadecimal digits to 4 bit binary values  then regrouping the binary bits into 3 bit octal digits   For example  to convert 3FA516      align  center    3    F    A    5    align  center    0011    1111    1010    0101        align  center    0    011    111    110    100    101    align  center    0    3    7    6    4    5     Therefore  3FA516   376458   3  See also  Computer numbering formats  Octal games  a game numbering system used in combinatorial game theory  4  References  5  External
