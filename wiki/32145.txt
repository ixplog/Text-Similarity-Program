Universal precautions refers to the practice  in medicine  of avoiding contact with patients  bodily fluids  by means of the wearing of nonporous articles such as medical gloves  goggles  and face shields  The practice was introduced in 1985â€“88  In 1987  the practice of universal precautions was adjusted by a set of rules known as body substance isolation  In 1996  both practices were replaced by the latest approach known as standard precautions  Use of personal protective equipment is now recommended in all health settings   1  Historical significance of universal precautions  Under universal precautions all patients were considered to be possible carriers of blood borne pathogens  The guideline recommended wearing gloves when collecting or handling blood and body fluids contaminated with blood  wearing face shields when there was danger of blood splashing on mucous membranes and disposing of all needles and sharp objects in puncture resistant containers   Universal precautions were designed for doctors  nurses  patients  and health care support workers who were required to come into contact with patients or bodily fluids  This included staff and others who might not come into direct contact with patients   Pathogens fall into two broad categories  bloodborne  carried in the body fluids  and airborne   2  Use  Universal precautions were typically practiced in any environment where workers were exposed to bodily fluids  such as   Blood  Semen  Vaginal secretions  Synovial fluid  Amniotic fluid  Cerebrospinal fluid  Pleural fluid  Peritoneal fluid  Pericardial fluid  Feces  Urine Bodily fluids that did not require such precautions included   Nasal secretions  Vomitus  Perspiration  Sputum  Saliva Universal precautions were the infection control techniques that were recommended following the AIDS outbreak in the 1980s  Every patient was treated as if infected and therefore precautions were taken to minimize risk   Essentially  universal precautions were good hygiene habits  such as hand washing and the use of gloves and other barriers  correct handling of hypodermic needles and scalpels  and aseptic techniques   3  Equipment  Protective clothing included but was not limited to   Barrier gowns  Gloves  Eyewear  goggles or glasses   Face shields  4  Additional precautions  Additional precautions were used in addition to universal precautions for patients who were known or suspected to have an infectious condition  and varied depending on the infection control needed of that patient  Additional precautions were not needed for blood borne infections  unless there were complicating factors   Conditions indicating additional precautions   Prion diseases  e g   Creutzfeldt Jakob disease   Diseases with air borne transmission  e g   tuberculosis   Diseases with droplet transmission  e g   mumps  rubella  influenza  pertussis   Transmission by direct or indirect contact with dried skin  e g   colonisation with MRSA  or contaminated surfaces or any combination of the above   5  Issues of stigma and discrimination  Research around stigma and discrimination in health related settings has implicated universal precautions as a means by which health care workers discriminate against patients  Particularly the employment of universal precautions when working with people with HIV and or hepatitis C has been demonstrated to be inconsistent and implicated with feelings of stigmatization reported by those populations  Health cased social research reveals that by not applying universal precautions universally  as is the purpose  health professionals are instead making judgements based on an individual s health status  It is speculated that this differential approach to care stems from stigma towards HIV and hepatitis C  rooted largely in fears and misconceptions around transmission and assumptions about patient lifestyle and risk   6  See also  Barrier nursing  Body substance isolation  Viral hemorrhagic fever  7  Footnotes  8  External links
