Pakistan s estimated population in 2014 is over 188 million  making it the world s sixth most populous country  behind Brazil and ahead of Nigeria  During 1950–2011  Pakistan s urban population expanded over sevenfold  while the total population increased by over fourfold  In the past  the country s population had a relatively high growth rate that has been changed by moderate birth rates  In 2014  the population growth rate stands at 1 49%   Dramatic social changes have led to rapid urbanization and the emergence of megacities  During 1990–2003  Pakistan sustained its historical lead as the second most urbanized nation in South Asia with city dwellers making up 36% of its population  Furthermore  50% of Pakistanis now reside in towns of 5 000 people or more   Pakistan has a multicultural and multi ethnic society and hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world as well as a young population   The Demographic history of Pakistan from the ancient Indus Valley

Almost all Pakistanis belong to the Indo Iranian linguistic group of the Indo European branch  Pakistan s rough estimates vary  but the consensus is that the Punjabis are the largest ethnic group  Pashtuns  Pakhtuns  make up the second largest group and Sindhi are the third largest ethnic group  Saraikis  a transitional group between Punjabis and Sindhis  make up 10 53% of the total population  The remaining large groups include the Muhajirs and the Baloch people  which make up 7 57% and 3 57% of the total population  respectively  Hindkowans and the Brahui  and the various peoples of the Gilgit–Baltistan  constitute roughly 4 66% of the total population  The Pakhtun and Baloch represent two of the major populations that are linguistically Iranian  while the majority Punjabis  Hindkowans  Sindhis and Saraikis are the major linguistically Indo Aryan groups   Descendents of Black Africans that were brought as slaves in the 15th to the 19th century are known as Sheedis  The Sheedis are Muslims and speak Balochi  Sindhi and Urdu   In 1850  the British started developing Karachi as a major port for trade and commerce  resulting in the arrival of a large number immigrants from Rajasthan  Gujarat and Goa  The Goan Catholics constitute the majority of the Christians in the city   After the Pakistan–India war in 1971  thousands of Biharis and Bengalis from Bangladesh arrived in the Karachi  followed by Muslim Rohingya refugees from Burma  and Asians from Uganda  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  UNHCR   approximately 1 7 million Afghan refugees remain in Pakistan as of 2009  Many of them were born and raised in Pakistan in the last 30 years but are still counted as citizens of Afghanistan  The majority of Afghans in Pakistan are ethnic Pakhtuns from southeastern Afghanistan  who have settled in Pakistan due to civil strife in their home country   All major ethnic groups in Pakistan  while categorized as separate entities  have thousands of years of shared history and inter mingling  In addition  inter marriages between ethnic groups within the country are not uncommon   4 2  Foreign born population in Pakistan  After the independence of Pakistan in 1947  many Muslims from India migrated to Pakistan and they are the largest group of foreign born residents  This group is dwindling because of its age  The second largest group of foreign born residents consists of Muslim refugees from Afghanistan  who have settled in Pakistan due to civil war in their home country  There are also smaller groups of Muslim immigrants from Burma  Bangladesh  Iraq  Somalia  Iran  Tajikistan  and Uzbekistan  among others   Source   4 3  Languages   * Saraiki was included with Punjabi in the 1951 and 1961 censuses    Following are the major languages spoken in Pakistan  The percentage of Pakistanis who are native speakers of that language is also given   There are around 75 to 80 known Pakistani languages although  in practice  there are primarily six major languages in Pakistan spoken by 95% of the population  Punjabi  Pashto  Sindhi  Saraiki  Urdu  and Balochi  The official language is English and the national language is Urdu  the census indicates that around 8% of the population speak Urdu as their first language  However  due to rapid urbanization and modernization  the use of Urdu as a primary language is increasing  especially amongst the growing urbanized middle class of Pakistan  Around 44% speak Punjabi  37 2% speak Pashto  15 5% speak Sindhi  10 5% Saraiki  7 5% Urdu  3 5% Balochi  and 3 5% other languages  Hindko  Brahui etc   as their first language  Most Pakistanis  however  speak or understand at least two to three languages and almost all Pakistanis speak or understand the national language  Urdu   The most prevalent native languages appear in bold below  with the percentage of the population speaking them as their first language rounded to the nearest percentage point   4 3 1  English  English is the official language  being widely used within the government  by the civil service and the officer ranks of the military  Pakistan s Constitution and laws are written in English  Nearly all schools  colleges and universities use English as the medium of instruction  Amongst the more educated social circles of Pakistan  English is seen as the language of upward mobility and its use is becoming more prevalent in upper social circles  often spoken alongside native Pakistani languages  Among countries that use English as an official language  Pakistan is the third most populous in the world   4 3 2  Urdu  Urdu is the national language of Pakistan  the lingua franca chosen to facilitate inter provincial communication between the country s diverse linguistic populations  Although only about 7 5% of Pakistanis speak it as their first language  it is spoken as a second and often third language by nearly all Pakistanis  Its introduction as the lingua franca was encouraged by the British Raj upon the capitulation and annexation of Sindh  1843  and Punjab  1849  with the subsequent ban on the use of Persian  the lingua franca of the region for many centuries  due to admiration of local rulers for the foreign language  The decision to make the language change was to institute a universal language throughout the then British Raj in South Asia as well as minimize the influence of Persia  the Ottoman Empire  and Afghanistan had on this transitional region  Urdu is a relatively new language in the contemporary sense but has undergone considerable modifications and development borrowing heavily on the traditions of older languages such as Persian  Arabic  Turkish and local South Asian languages  all of which can be found in its vocabulary  It began as a standardized register of Hindi and in its spoken form  It is widely used  both formally and informally  for personal letters as well as public literature  in the literary sphere and in the popular media  It is a required subject of study in all primary and secondary schools  It is the first language of most Muhajirs  Muslim refugees that arrived from different parts of India after  the independence of Pakistan in 1947  that form nearly 8% of Pakistan s population and is an acquired language  But nearly all of Pakistan s native ethnic groups representing almost 92% of the population making Pakistan a unique country in the choice of national languages  As Pakistan s national language  Urdu has been promoted as a token of national unity  In recent years  the Urdu spoken in Pakistan has undergone further evolution and acquired a particularly Pakistani flavour to it often absorbing local native terminology and adopting a strong Punjabi  Sindhi and Pashto leaning in terms of intonations and vocabulary  It is a modern language which is constantly evolving from its original form  It is written in a modified form of the Perso Arabic script  Nastaliq  and its basic Hindi based vocabulary has been enriched by words from Persian  Arabic  Turkic languages and English  Urdu has drawn inspiration from Persian literature and has now an enormous stock of words from that language  In recent years  the Urdu spoken in Pakistan has gradually incorporated words from many of the native languages found there including Pashto  Punjabi and Sindhi to name a few  As such  the language is constantly developing and has acquired a particularly  Pakistani  flavour to it distinguishing itself from that spoken in ancient times and in India  The first poetry in Urdu was by the poet Amir Khusro  1253–1325  and the first Urdu book Woh Majlis was written in 1728 and the first time the word  Urdu  was used by Sirajuddin Ali Khan Arzoo in 1741  The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir  1658–1707  spoke Urdu  or Hindustani  fluently as did his descendents while his ancestors mostly spoke Persian and Turkish   4 3 3  Punjabi  Punjabi is a provincial language spoken as a first language by more than 50% of Pakistanis  mostly in Punjab  as well as by a large number of people in Karachi  It is an important language since Punjabi dialects are spoken by more than half of Pakistanis  However  Punjabi does not have any official status in Pakistan  The exact number of Punjabi speakers in Pakistan is hard to determine since there are many dialects such as Saraiki  which most regard as part of Punjabi and others regard as separate language  When taking into account Hindko  Potwari  Pahari  Saraiki  Punjabi dialects are thus spoken by almost 60% of the population in Pakistan  The standard Punjabi dialect is from Lahore  Sialkot  Gujranwala and Sheikhupura districts of the Pakistani Punjab which was used by Waris Shah  1722–1798  in his book Heer Ranjha and is also nowadays the language of Punjabi literature  film and music  such as Lollywood  Other dialects are Multani or Saraiki in the West and South  Pothowari and Hindko in the North  Dogri in the mountain areas and Shahpuri in the Sargodha district   Punjabi is descended from Prakrit in the Vedic period  1700 BC   Pali  and Apabhramsha in the Ashoka period  273 BC – 232 BC  and Hindvi  Lahori and Multani in the Muslim period  711 AD – 1857 AD   Punjabi literature was principally spiritual in nature and has had a very rich oral tradition  The great poetry written by Sufi saints has been the folklore of the Punjab and is still sung with great love in any part of the region   4 3 4  Sindhi  Sindhi is a provincial language spoken as a second language by 15 5% of Pakistanis  mostly in Sindh  It has a rich literature and is used in schools  It is an Indo Aryan  Indo European  language  derived from Sanskrit  The Arabs ruled Sindh for more than 150 years after Muhammad bin Qasim conquered it in 712 AD  remaining there for three years to set up Arab rule  Consequently  the social fabric of Sindh contains elements of Arabic society  Sindhi is spoken by over 36 million people in Pakistan  and is the official language of Sindh province  It is widely spoken in the Lasbela District of Balochistan  where the Lasi tribe speaks a dialect of Sindhi   many areas of the Naseerabad and Jafarabad districts of Balochistan  and by the Sindhi diaspora abroad  Sindhi language has six major dialects  Sireli  Vicholi  Lari  Thari  Lasi and Kachhi  It is written in the Arabic script with several additional letters to accommodate special sounds  The largest Sindhi speaking cities are Karachi  Hyderabad  Sukkur  Shikarpur  Dadu  Jacobabad  Larkana  Mirpur Khas  Thatta  Badin and Nawabshah  Sindhi literature is also spiritual in nature  Shah Abdul Latif Bhita i  1689–1752  is one of its greatest poets  and wrote Sassi Punnun and Umar Marvi  folk stories  in his famous book Shah Jo Risalo   Sindhi dialects   Sindhi Saraiki  a version of Saraiki language regarded as a dialect of Sindhi  spoken mainly in Upper Sindh   Vicholi  in Vicholo  i e  Central Sindh  Lari  in Laru  i e  Lower Sindh  Lasi  in Lasa B’elo  a part of Kohistan in Baluchistan on the western side of Sindh  Thari or Thareli  in Tharu  the desert region on the southeast border of Sindh and a part of the Jaisalmer district in Rajasthan  Kachhi  in the Kutch region and in a part of Kathiawar in Gujarat  on the southern side of Sindh Vicholi is considered as the standard dialect by all Sindhi speakers   4 3 5  Pashto  Pashto is a provincial language spoken as a first language by 37 2%  49–58 millions  of Pakistanis  mostly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in Balochistan as well as by immigrants to the eastern provinces who are often not counted due to census irregularities  The Pashto has rich written literary traditions as well as an oral tradition  There are two major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified  these are Pakhto  which is the Northern  Peshawar  variety  and the softer Pashto spoken in the southern areas  Khushal Khan Khattak  1613–1689  and Rahman Baba  1633–1708  were the most famous poets in the Pashto language  In the last part of 20th century  Pakhto or Pashto has produced some great poets like Ghani Khan  Khatir Afridi and Amir Hamza Shinwari  There are also many Pakistanis from the adjacent regions of Punjab  Sindh and Balochistan who are conversant in Pashto and count it as their second language  They are not included in the overall percentage   The Pashtuns  Pakhtuns or Pathans   originally from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  FATA and northern Balochistan  are now the city s second largest ethnic group in Karachi after Muhajirs  With as high as 7 million by some estimates  the city of Karachi in Pakistan has the largest concentration of urban Pakhtun population in the world  including 50 000 registered Afghan refugees in the city  Karachi is the biggest Pashto speaking city in the world although the Pashto speakers constitute only about 25% of Karachi s population   4 3 6  Saraiki  See also Punjabi dialects  Saraiki  sometimes spelled Seraiki and Siraiki  is viewed as a dialect of Punjabi language  Debate of language or dialect is an ongoing phenomenon in Indo Aryan  Indic  languages  It is spoken as a first language mostly in the southern districts of Punjab  Multan  Lodhran  Bahawalpur Layyah  Dera Ghazi Khan  Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan  It is also spoken by majority of population of Dera Ismail Khan district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province  Kachi plain of Balochistan  northern parts of Sindh  and cities of Hyderabad and Karachi   4 3 7  Balochi  Balochi is a provincial language spoken as first language by about 3 5% of Pakistanis  mostly in Balochistan  Sindh and southern Punjab  The name Balochi or Baluchi is not found before the 10th century  It is believed that the language was brought to its present location in a series of migrations Aleppo  Syria  Rakshani is the major dialect group in terms of numbers  Sarhaddi  is a sub dialect of Rakshani  Other sub – dialects are Qalati  Chagai Kharani  and Makrani  The Eastern Hill Balochi or Northern Balochi are distinct dialects The Kethran language in North East Balochistan is also a variant of Balochi  It is one of the 9 distinguished languages of Pakistan  Since Balochi is a poetic and rich language and have a certain degree of affinity to Urdu  Balochi poets tend to be very good poets in Urdu as well as Ata Shaad  Gul Khan Nasir and Noon Meem Danish are excellent examples of this   4 3 8  Brahui  Brahui    is a regional language of uncertain origin despite the fact that the bulk of the language shares lexical similarities to Balochi as well as Sindhi  In colonial times  many British linguists tried to make the claim of a possible Dravidian language origin but this has not been conclusively proven despite ongoing research in the language for a century now  spoken in southern Pakistan  may have evolved from the original languages of Indus valley civilizations at Mehrgarh   However it is heavily influenced by Balochi and Pashto  It is spoken in central and east central Balochistan  The Mengals are a famous Brahvi tribe  Around 1–1 5% of Pakistani population has Brahui as their first language  It is one of the nine distinguished languages of Pakistan   The Brahui population of Balochistan has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a relict population  perhaps indicating that Dravidian languages were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming Indo Aryan languages  However it has now been demonstrated that the Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from central India after 1000 CE  The absence of any Avestan  an older Iranian language  loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis  The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary  Balochi  is a western Iranian language like Kurdish  and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE   4 3 9  Hindko  Hindko is an ancient regional Indo Aryan language spoken by Hindkowans in Pakistan  It is very similar to northern dialects of Punjabi  The language is spoken in the areas of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  including Hazara   local people of Peshawar Punjab and Azad Kashmir by an estimated 2 2 to 4 million people  During the pre Buddhist era in present day Pakistan  the language of the masses was refined by the ancient grammarian Pāṇini  who set the rules of a structurally rigorous language called Sanskrit which was used principally for scriptures  analogous to Latin in the Western world   Meanwhile  the vernacular language of the masses  Prakrit developed into many tongues and dialects which spread over the northern parts of South Asia  Hindko is believed to be closely related to Prakrit  Due to the geographic isolation of the regions  it has undergone very little grammatical corruption  but has borrowed considerable vocabulary from its neighbours  in particular Pashto  It shows close affinity to Punjabi and the Lahnda sub group of Indo Aryan tongues and can be sub divided into a northern and southern dialects   4 3 10  Kashmiri  Kashmiri  كأشُر  is an ancient Dardic language spoken in Azad Kashmir  Gilgit–Baltistan and Punjab provinces of Pakistan  There are over 100 000 Kashmiri speakers in Pakistan   4 3 11  Dari and Tajiki  Many Dari speakers and Tajiks  from Afghanistan have settled in Pakistan permanently  There are also Tajiks refugees from Tajikistan that have settled in Pakistan   4 3 12  Arabic  Arabic is considered to be the religious language of Pakistan  The Quran  Sunnah  Hadith and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with Urdu translation  The large numbers of Pakistanis living in the Persian Gulf region and in other Middle Eastern countries has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Pakistan  Arabic is taught as a religious language in Mosques  Schools  Colleges  Universities and Madrassahs  Nearly all of Pakistan s Muslim population has had some form of education in the reading  writing and pronunciation of the Arabic language   Many Arabs who took part in Afghanistan war have now settled in Pakistan permanently with their families  Millions of Pakistanis that have worked in Middle East also speak Arabic as a second language   4 3 13  Turkic  Turkic languages were used by the ruling Turco Mongols  or Mughals  and earlier Sultans of India many of whom have settled in Pakistan  There are pockets of Turkic speakers found throughout the country  notably in the valleys in the countries northern regions which lie adjacent to Central Asia and Afghanistan  western Pakistani region of Waziristan principally around Kanigoram where the Burki tribe dwells and in Pakistan s urban centres of Karachi  Lahore and Islamabad  The autobiography of Mughal emperor Babur  Tuzk Babari was also written in Turkish   Many Turkic speaking refugees  Uzbeks and Turkmens  from Afghanistan have settled in Pakistan permanently  They are also Uzbeks and Turkmen refugees that have moved from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and settled in Pakistan  Turkey also provides scholarships to large number of Pakistani students to study in Turkish universities   The word Urdu is of Turkic origin  as Urdu was originally called Zaban e Ordu or language of the Army  Ordu means army in many Turkic languages   4 3 14  Other Pakistani languages  Numerous other languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people  especially in some of the more remote and isolated places in  for example  the Northern Areas of Pakistan  Other Indo European languages spoken in Pakistan include Pothohari  Shina Balti  Gujjari  Kutchi  Wakhi  Kashmiri  Marwari  Memoni  Khowar  and Dari Persian  Non Indo European languages include Brahui and Burushaski  a language isolate   There are some languages that are spoken by less than a thousand people  such as Aer   4 4  Classification  4 4 1  Indo European  Most of Pakistan s languages are Indo European languages and within the smaller Indo Iranian sub branch   4 4 1 1  Indo Aryan languages  Around 80% of Pakistan s population speak one or more of the various Indo Aryan languages  Usually concentrated in the heavily populated areas east of the Indus river  the Indo Aryan languages and their cultures form the predominant cultural group in the country  They derive their roots from the Sanskrit language of Aryan invadors and are later heavily influenced by the languages of the later Muslim arrivals  i e   Turkish  Persian  and Arabic   and are all written in a variant of either the Arabic or Nastaliq script  Urdu  the country s national language  is an Indo Aryan tongue  Punjabi  Hindko and Seraiki  all mutually intelligible  are classified by linguists as dialects of an Indo Aryan speech called Lahnda  also spelled as Lehnda  These are also  to a lesser extent  mutually intelligible with Urdu  Added together  speakers of these mutually intelligible languages make up nearly two thirds of Pakistan s population  Sindhi is the common language of the people of Sindh in southern Pakistan and has a rich literary history of its own  traced back to the era of the early Arab arrivals  The Dardic languages of Gilgit–Baltistan  Azad Kashmir and the northwestern mountains are sometimes classified by many linguists as belonging to the Indo Aryan family  Other Indo Aryan languages include Gujarati  Kutchi  Memoni and others   4 4 1 2  Dardic languages  The Dardic languages are spoken in the northern Pakistan  They include Shina  spoken in Gilgit  Chilas and Diamar   Khowar  spoken in Chitral  Ghizer  Swat and the balti language  spoken in  baltistan  including  skardu  district and  Ghanche  district  Majority of population living in the valley of Hunza  Nagar and Yasin speak Mishaski  Kalam Valley of upper Swat   Kalash  spoken by Kalash tribe   Kohistani  spoken in upper Swat and Kohistan  and Kashmiri mostly by Immigrants from Kashmir valley and by a few in the Neelum District   Kashmiri spoken in north east Azad Kashmir and the adjacent Kashmir valley   not to be confused with Pahari language spoken in the lower Azad Kashmir  is one of the Dardic languages that has a literary tradition that goes well back into the history whereas other Dardic languages spoken in northern Pakistan  do not have written literature  It is believed to be the result of the northern areas of Pakistan having remained isolated in the mountain valleys from the others for centuries   4 4 1 3  Iranian  Pashto  Yidgha and Wakhi are Eastern Iranian languages spoken in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  Balochistan and the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan  Balochi spoken in Balochistan is classified as a members of the Northwestern Iranian languages  If combined  Iranian peoples who speak Pashto  Balochi  Yidgha and Wakhi comprise about 18% of the population of Pakistan  and are concentrated in the northwest and west of Pakistan   4 4 2  Brahui  Brahui may or may not be a language isolate and many origins have been hypothesized for it including Iranian and Dravidian  spoken in southern Pakistan  primarily in Kalat in Balochistan  The Brahui population of Balochistan has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a relict population  perhaps indicating that Dravidian languages were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming Indo Aryan languages  However it has now been demonstrated that the Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from central India after 1000 CE  The absence of any Avestan  an older Iranian language  loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis  The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary  Balochi  is a western Iranian language like Kurdish  and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE   4 4 3  Burushaski  Burushaski is a language isolate  spoken by Burusho people in Hunza  Nagar  Yasin  and parts of the Gilgit valleys in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan   4 4 3 1  SHINA  Shina the largest language spoken in Gilgit Baltistan in diamer ghizer some areas of baltistan  district gilgit and Nagar district   5  Religion  According to the CIA World Factbook  Library of Congress  Oxford University  over 97% of the population of Pakistan is Muslim and the remaining 3% is Christian  Hindu and others  Majority of the Muslims practice Sunni with a significant minority of Shi as   Nearly all Pakistani Sunni Muslims belong to the Hanafi school  although there are some Hanbalis and Ahlul Hadeeth  The majority of Shia Muslims belong to the Ithnā‘Ashariyyah branch  while a smaller number practice Ismailism  The Ahmadi Muslims
