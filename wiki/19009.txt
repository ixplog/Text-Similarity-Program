The Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram  They measured the willingness of study participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience  Milgram first described his research in 1963 in an article published in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book  Obedience to Authority  An Experimental View   The experiments began in July 1961  three months after the start of the trial of German Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem  Milgram devised his psychological study to answer the popular question at that particular time   Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders  Could we call them all accomplices   The experiments have been repeated many times in the following years with consistent results within differing societies  although not with the same percentages around the globe  The experiments were also controversial and considered by some scientists to be unethical and physically or psychologically abusive   Psychologist Diana Baumrind considered the experiment  harmful because it may cause permanent psychological damage and cause people to be less trusting in the future   Australian psychologist Gina Perry examined Milgram s methodology  using original data from the Yale archives in her 2013 book Behind the Shock Machine  The Untold Story of the Notorious Milgram Psychology Experiments  Perry claims that Milgram s experiments and conclusions are flawed because he intentionally downplayed or ignored critical data that failed to support his thesis   1  The experiment  Three individuals were involved  the one running the experiment  the subject of the experiment  a volunteer   and a confederate pretending to be a volunteer  These three people fill three distinct roles  the Experimenter  an authoritative role   the Teacher  a role intended to obey the orders of the Experimenter   and the Learner  the recipient of stimulus from the Teacher   The subject and the actor both drew slips of paper to determine their roles  but unknown to the subject  both slips said  teacher   The actor would always claim to have drawn the slip that read  learner   thus guaranteeing that the subject would always be the  teacher   At this point  the  teacher  and  learner  were separated into different rooms where they could communicate but not see each other  In one version of the experiment  the confederate was sure to mention to the participant that he had a heart condition   At some point prior to the actual test  the  teacher  was given a sample electric shock from the electroshock generator in order to experience firsthand what the shock that the  learner  would supposedly receive during the experiment would feel like  The  teacher  was then given a list of word pairs that he was to teach the learner  The teacher began by reading the list of word pairs to the learner  The teacher would then read the first word of each pair and read four possible answers  The learner would press a button to indicate his response  If the answer was incorrect  the teacher would administer a shock to the learner  with the voltage increasing in 15 volt increments for each wrong answer  If correct  the teacher would read the next word pair   The subjects believed that for each wrong answer  the learner was receiving actual shocks  In reality  there were no shocks  After the confederate was separated from the subject  the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator  which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level  After a number of voltage level increases  the actor started to bang on the wall that separated him from the subject  After several times banging on the wall and complaining about his heart condition  all responses by the learner would cease   At this point  many people indicated their desire to stop the experiment and check on the learner  Some test subjects paused at 135 volts and began to question the purpose of the experiment  Most continued after being assured that they would not be held responsible  A few subjects began to laugh nervously or exhibit other signs of extreme stress once they heard the screams of pain coming from the learner   If at any time the subject indicated his desire to halt the experiment  he was given a succession of verbal prods by the experimenter  in this order   Please continue   The experiment requires that you continue   It is absolutely essential that you continue   You have no other choice  you must go on  If the subject still wished to stop after all four successive verbal prods  the experiment was halted  Otherwise  it was halted after the subject had given the maximum 450 volt shock three times in succession   The experimenter also gave special prods if the teacher made specific comments  If the teacher asked whether the learner might suffer permanent physical harm  the experimenter replied   Although the shocks may be painful  there is no permanent tissue damage  so please go on   If the teacher said that the learner clearly wants to stop  the experimenter replied   Whether the learner likes it or not  you must go on until he has learned all the word pairs correctly  so please go on    2  Results  Before conducting the experiment  Milgram polled fourteen Yale University senior year psychology majors to predict the behavior of 100 hypothetical teachers  All of the poll respondents believed that only a very small fraction of teachers  the range was from zero to 3 out of 100  with an average of 1 2  would be prepared to inflict the maximum voltage  Milgram also informally polled his colleagues and found that they  too  believed very few subjects would progress beyond a very strong shock  Milgram also polled forty psychiatrists from a medical school  and they believed that by the tenth shock  when the victim demands to be free  most subjects would stop the experiment  They predicted that by the 300 volt shock  when the victim refuses to answer  only 3 73 percent of the subjects would still continue and  they believed that  only a little over one tenth of one percent of the subjects would administer the highest shock on the board    In Milgram s first set of experiments  65 percent  26 of 40  of experiment participants administered the experiment s final massive 450 volt shock  though many were very uncomfortable doing so  at some point  every participant paused and questioned the experiment  some said they would refund the money they were paid for participating in the experiment  Throughout the experiment  subjects displayed varying degrees of tension and stress  Subjects were sweating  trembling  stuttering  biting their lips  groaning  digging their fingernails into their skin  and some were even having nervous laughing fits or seizures   Milgram summarized the experiment in his 1974 article   The Perils of Obedience   writing   The original Simulated Shock Generator and Event Recorder  or shock box  is located in the Archives of the History of American Psychology   Later  Milgram and other psychologists performed variations of the experiment throughout the world  with similar results  Milgram later investigated the effect of the experiment s locale on obedience levels by holding an experiment in an unregistered  backstreet office in a bustling city  as opposed to at Yale  a respectable university  The level of obedience   although somewhat reduced  was not significantly lower   What made more of a difference was the proximity of the  learner  and the experimenter  There were also variations tested involving groups   Thomas Blass of the University of Maryland  Baltimore County performed a meta analysis on the results of repeated performances of the experiment  He found that the percentage of participants who are prepared to inflict fatal voltages remains remarkably constant  61â€“66 percent  regardless of time or country   None of the participants who refused to administer the final shocks insisted that the experiment itself be terminated  nor left the room to check the health of the victim without requesting permission to leave  as per Milgram s notes and recollections  when fellow psychologist Philip Zimbardo asked him about that point   Milgram created a documentary film titled Obedience showing the experiment and its results  He also produced a series of five social psychology films  some of which dealt with his experiments   3  Criticism  3 1  Ethics  The Milgram Shock Experiment raised questions about the research ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress and inflicted insight suffered by the participants  In Milgram s defense  84 percent of former participants surveyed later said they were  glad  or  very glad  to have participated  15 percent chose neutral responses  92% of all former participants responding   Many later wrote expressing thanks  Milgram repeatedly received offers of assistance and requests to join his staff from former participants  Six years later  at the height of the Vietnam War   one of the participants in the experiment sent correspondence to Milgram  explaining why he was glad to have participated despite the stress   Milgram argued  in  Obedience to Authority  An Experimental View   that the ethical criticism provoked by his experiments was because his findings were disturbing and revealed unwelcome truths about human nature  Others have argued that the ethical debate has diverted attention from more serious problems with the experiment s methodology  Author Gina Perry found an unpublished paper in Milgram s archives that shows Milgram s own concern with how believable the experimental set up was to subjects involved  Milgram s unpublished analysis indicated that many subjects suspected that the experiment was a hoax  a finding that casts doubt on the veracity of his results  In the journal Jewish Currents  Joseph Dimow  a participant in the 1961 experiment at Yale University  wrote about his early withdrawal as a  teacher   suspicious  that the whole experiment was designed to see if ordinary Americans would obey immoral orders  as many Germans had done during the Nazi period    3 2  Applicability to the Jewish Holocaust  Milgram sparked direct critical response in the scientific community by claiming that  a common psychological process is centrally involved in both  his laboratory experiments and Nazi Germany  events   Professor James Waller  Chair of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Keene State College  formerly Chair of Whitworth College Psychology Department  expressed the opinion that Milgram experiments do not correspond well to the Holocaust events   The subjects of Milgram experiments  wrote James Waller  Becoming Evil   were assured in advance that no permanent physical damage would result from their actions  However  the Holocaust perpetrators were fully aware of their hands on killing and maiming of the victims   The laboratory subjects themselves did not know their victims and were not motivated by racism  On the other hand  the Holocaust perpetrators displayed an intense devaluation of the victims through a lifetime of personal development   Those serving punishment at the lab were not sadists  nor hate mongers  and often exhibited great anguish and conflict in the experiment  unlike the designers and executioners of the Final Solution  see    who had a clear  goal  on their hands  set beforehand   The experiment lasted for an hour  with no time for the subjects to contemplate the implications of their behavior  Meanwhile  the Holocaust lasted for years with ample time for a moral assessment of all individuals and organizations involved  In the opinion of Thomas Blassâ€”who is the author of a scholarly monograph on the experiment  The Man Who Shocked The World  published in 2004â€”the historical evidence pertaining to actions of the Holocaust perpetrators speaks louder than words   3 3  Charges of data manipulation  After an investigation of the test  Australian psychologist Gina Perry claimed that Milgram had manipulated his results   Overall  over half disobeyed   Perry claimed  For those who obeyed  there were  on one occasion  many more than four promptings  in fact as many as 26  Several times  in fact  some subjects asked to swap places with the learner  Perry further claims that some subjects thought the entire procedure was a reality TV show   4  Interpretations  Professor Milgram elaborated two theories   The first is the theory of conformism  based on Solomon Asch conformity experiments  describing the fundamental relationship between the group of reference and the individual person  A subject who has neither ability nor expertise to make decisions  especially in a crisis  will leave decision making to the group and its hierarchy  The group is the person s behavioral model   The second is the agentic state theory  wherein  per Milgram   the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view themselves as the instrument for carrying out another person s wishes  and they therefore no longer see themselves as responsible for their actions  Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person  all of the essential features of obedience follow    4 1  Alternative interpretations  In his book Irrational Exuberance  Yale Finance Professor Robert Shiller argues that other factors might be partially able to explain the Milgram Experiments   In a 2006 experiment  a computerized avatar was used in place of the learner receiving electrical shocks  Although the participants administering the shocks were aware that the learner was unreal  the experimenters reported that participants responded to the situation physiologically  as if it were real    For a 2009 episode of the BBC science documentary series Horizon  the Milgram experiment was replicated  Of the twelve participants  only three refused to continue to the end of the experiment  Speaking during the episode  social psychologist Clifford Stott discussed the influence that the idealism of scientific enquiry had on the volunteers  He remarked   The influence is ideological  It s about what they believe science to be  that science is a positive product  it produces beneficial findings and knowledge to society that are helpful for society  So there s that sense of science is providing some kind of system for good    5  Replications and variations  5 1  Milgram s variations  In Obedience to Authority  An Experimental View  1974   Milgram describes nineteen variations of his experiment  some of which had not been previously reported   Several experiments varied the immediacy of the teacher and learner  Generally  when the victim s physical immediacy was increased  the participant s compliance decreased  The participant s compliance also decreased when the authority s physical immediacy decreased  Experiments 1â€“4   For example  in Experiment 2  where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter  compliance decreased to 21 percent  Interestingly  some participants deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment  In the variation where the learner s physical immediacy was closest  where participants had to hold the learner s arm physically onto a shock plate  compliance decreased  Under that condition  thirty percent of participants completed the experiment   In Experiment 8  an all female contingent was used  previously  all participants had been men  Obedience did not significantly differ  though the women communicated experiencing higher levels of stress   Experiment 10 took place in a modest office in Bridgeport  Connecticut  purporting to be the commercial entity  Research Associates of Bridgeport  without apparent connection to Yale University  to eliminate the university s prestige as a possible factor influencing the participants  behavior  In those conditions  obedience dropped to 47 5 percent  though the difference was not statistically significant   Milgram also combined the effect of authority with that of conformity  In those experiments  the participant was joined by one or two additional  teachers   also actors  like the  learner    The behavior of the participants  peers strongly affected the results  In Experiment 17  when two additional teachers refused to comply  only 4 of 40 participants continued in the experiment  In Experiment 18  the participant performed a subsidiary task  reading the questions via microphone or recording the learner s answers  with another  teacher  who complied fully  In that variation  37 of 40 continued with the experiment   5 2  Replications  Around the time of the release of Obedience to Authority in 1973â€“74  a version of the experiment was conducted at La Trobe University in Australia  As reported by Perry in her 2012 book Behind the Shock Machine  some of the participants experienced long lasting psychological effects  possibly due to the lack of proper debriefing by the experimenter   In 2002  the British artist Rod Dickinson created The Milgram Re enactment  an exact reconstruction of parts of the original experiment  including the uniforms  lighting  and rooms used  An audience watched the four hour performance through one way glass windows  A video of this performance was first shown at the CCA Gallery in Glasgow in 2002   A partial replication of the experiment was staged by British illusionist Derren Brown and broadcast on UK s Channel 4 in The Heist  2006    Another partial replication of the experiment was conducted by Jerry M  Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series Basic Instincts  Burger noted that  current standards for the ethical treatment of participants clearly place Milgram s studies out of bounds   In 2009  Burger was able to receive approval from the institutional review board by modifying several of the experimental protocols  Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram found in 1961â€“62  even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants  In addition  half the replication participants were female  and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants  Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue  However  participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition   In the 2010 French documentary Le Jeu de la Mort  The Game of Death   researchers recreated the Milgram experiment with an added critique of reality television by presenting the scenario as a game show pilot  Volunteers were given â‚¬40 and told they would not win any money from the game  as this was only a trial  Only 16 of 80  contestants   teachers  chose to end the game before delivering the highest voltage punishment   The experiment was performed on Dateline NBC on an episode airing April 25  2010   The Discovery Channel aired the  How Evil are You  segment of Curiosity on October 30  2011  The episode was hosted by Eli Roth  who produced results similar to the original Milgram experiment  though the highest voltage punishment used was 165 volts  rather than 450 volts   Due to increasingly widespread knowledge of the experiment  recent replications of the procedure have had to ensure that participants were not previously aware of it   5 3  Other variations  Charles Sheridan and Richard King  at the University of Missouri and the University of California  Berkley  respectively  hypothesized that some of Milgram s subjects may have suspected that the victim was faking  so they repeated the experiment with a real victim  a  cute  fluffy puppy  who was given real  albeit apparently harmless  electric shocks  Their findings were similar to those of Milgram  half of the male subjects and all of the females obeyed throughout  Many subjects showed high levels of distress during the experiment  and some openly wept  In addition  Sheridan and King found that the duration for which the shock button was pressed decreased as the shocks got higher  meaning that for higher shock levels  subjects were more hesitant   6  Media depictions  Obedience is a black and white film of the experiment  shot by Milgram himself  It is distributed by Alexander Street Press   The Tenth Level was a 1975 CBS television film about the experiment  featuring William Shatner  Ossie Davis  and John Travolta   I as in Icarus is a 1979 French conspiracy thriller with Yves Montand as a lawyer investigating the assassination
