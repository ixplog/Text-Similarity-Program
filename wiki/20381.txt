Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth from an orebody  lode  vein  seam  or reef  which forms the mineralized package of economic interest to the miner   Ores recovered by mining include metals  coal  oil shale  gemstones  limestone  dimension stone  rock salt  potash  gravel  and clay  Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes  or created artificially in a laboratory or factory  Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non renewable resource such as petroleum  natural gas  or even water   Mining of stone and metal has been done since pre historic times  Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies  analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine  extraction of the desired materials  and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed   The nature of mining processes creates a potential negative impact on the environment both during the mining operations and for years after the mine is closed  This impact has led most of the world s nations to adopt regulations designed to moderate the negative effects of mining operations  Safety has long been a concern as well  and modern practices have improved safety in mines significantly   1  History  1 1  Prehistoric mining  Since the beginning of civilization  people have used stone  ceramics and  later  metals found close to the Earth s surface  These were used to make early tools and weapons  for example  high quality flint found in northern France and southern England was used to create flint tools  Flint mines have been found in chalk areas where seams of the stone were followed underground by shafts and galleries  The mines at Grimes Graves are especially famous  and like most other flint mines  are Neolithic in origin  ca 4000 BC ca 3000 BC   Other hard rocks mined or collected for axes included the greenstone of the Langdale axe industry based in the English Lake District   The oldest known mine on archaeological record is the  Lion Cave  in Swaziland  which radiocarbon dating shows to be about 43 000 years old  At this site Paleolithic humans mined hematite to make the red pigment ochre  Mines of a similar age in Hungary are believed to be sites where Neanderthals may have mined flint for weapons and tools   1 2  Ancient Egypt  Ancient Egyptians mined malachite at Maadi  At first  Egyptians used the bright green malachite stones for ornamentations and pottery  Later  between 2613 and 2494 BC  large building projects required expeditions abroad to the area of Wadi Maghara in order  to secure minerals and other resources not available in Egypt itself   Quarries for turquoise and copper were also found at  Wadi Hamamat  Tura  Aswan and various other Nubian sites  on the Sinai Peninsula and at Timna   Mining in Egypt occurred in the earliest dynasties  The gold mines of Nubia were among the largest and most extensive of any in Ancient Egypt  and are described by the Greek author Diodorus Siculus  He mentions that fire setting was one method used to break down the hard rock holding the gold  One of the complexes is shown in one of the earliest known maps  The miners crushed the ore and ground it to a fine powder before washing the powder for the gold dust   1 3  Ancient Greek and Roman Mining  Mining in Europe has a very long history  Examples include the silver mines of Laurium  which helped support the Greek city state of Athens  However  it is the Romans who developed large scale mining methods  especially the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by numerous aqueducts  The water was used for a variety of purposes  including removing overburden and rock debris  called hydraulic mining  as well as washing comminuted  or crushed  ores and driving simple machinery   The Romans used hydraulic mining methods on a large scale to prospect for the veins of ore  especially a now obsolete form of mining known as hushing  It involved building numerous aqueducts to supply water to the minehead where it was stored in large reservoirs and tanks  When a full tank was opened  the wave of water sluiced away the overburden to expose the bedrock underneath and any gold veins  The rock was then attacked by fire setting to heat the rock  which would be quenched with a stream of water  The thermal shock cracked the rock  enabling it to be removed  aided by further streams of water from the overhead tanks  The Roman miners used similar methods to work cassiterite deposits in Cornwall and lead ore in the Pennines   The methods had been developed by the Romans in Spain in 25 AD to exploit large alluvial gold deposits  the largest site being at Las Medulas  where seven long aqueducts were built to tap local rivers and to sluice the deposits  Spain was one of the most important mining regions  but all regions of the Roman Empire were exploited  In Great Britain the natives had mined minerals for millennia  but when the Romans came  the scale of the operations changed dramatically   The Romans needed what Britain possessed  especially gold  silver  tin  and lead  Roman techniques were not limited to surface mining  They followed the ore veins underground once opencast mining was no longer feasible  At Dolaucothi they stoped out the veins  and drove adits through barren rock to drain the stopes  The same adits were also used to ventilate the workings  especially important when fire setting was used  At other parts of the site  they penetrated the water table and dewatered the mines using several kinds of machine  especially reverse overshot water wheels  These were used extensively in the copper mines at Rio Tinto in Spain  where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels arranged in pairs  and lifting water about   They were worked as treadmills with miners standing on the top slats  Many examples of such devices have been found in old Roman mines and some examples are now preserved in the British Museum and the National Museum of Wales   1 4  Medieval Europe  Mining as an industry underwent dramatic changes in medieval Europe  The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron  Other precious metals were also used mainly for gilding or coinage  Initially  many metals were obtained through open pit mining  and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths  rather than though the digging of deep mine shafts  Around the 14th century  the demand for weapons  armour  stirrups  and horseshoes greatly increased the demand for iron  Medieval knights  for example  were often laden with up to 100 pounds of plate or chain link armour in addition to swords  lances and other weapons  The overwhelming dependency on iron for military purposes helped to spur increased iron production and extraction processes   The silver crisis of 1465 occurred when the mines had all reached depths at which the shafts could no longer be pumped dry with the available technology  Although an increased use of bank notes and credit during this period did decrease the value of  and dependence on  precious metals  these forms of currency still remained vital to the story of medieval mining   In the mid sixteenth century the great attack on mineral deposits spread from central Europe to England  England had iron  zinc  copper  lead  and tin ores  On the continent all mineral deposits belonged to the crown  and this regalian right was stoutly maintained  but in England it was pared down to gold and silver  of which there was virtually none  by a judicial decision of 1568 and a law of 1688  Landlords therefore owned the base metals and coal under their estates and had a strong inducement to extract them or to lease the deposits and collect royalties from mine operators  English  German  and Dutch capital combined to finance extraction and refining  Hundreds of German technicians and skilled workers were brought over  in 1642 a colony of 4 000 foreigners was mining and smelting copper at Keswick in the northwestern mountains   Use of water power in the form of water mills was extensive  The water mills were employed in crushing ore  raising ore from shafts  and ventilating galleries by powering giant bellows  Black powder was first used in mining in Selmecbánya  Kingdom of Hungary in 1627  Black powder allowed blasting of rock and earth to loosen and reveal ore veins  Blasting was much faster than fire setting and allowed the mining of previously impenetrable metals and ores  In 1762  the world s first mining academy was established in the same town   The widespread adoption of agricultural innovations such as the iron plowshare  as well as the growing use of metal as a building material  was also a driving force in the tremendous growth of the iron industry during this period  Inventions like the arrastra were often used by the Spanish to pulverize ore after being mined  This device was powered by animals and used the same principles used for grain threshing   Much of the knowledge of medieval mining techniques comes from books such as Biringuccio’s De la pirotechnia and probably most importantly from Georg Agricola s De re metallica  1556   These books detail many different mining methods used in German and Saxon mines  One of the prime issues confronting medieval miners  and one which Agricola explains in detail  was the removal of water from mining shafts  As miners dug deeper to access new veins  flooding became a very real obstacle  The mining industry became dramatically more efficient and prosperous with the invention of mechanical and animal driven pumps   1 5  Classical Philippine Civilization  Mining in the Philippines began around 1000 BC  The early Filipinos worked various mines of gold  silver  copper and iron  Jewels  gold ingots  chains  calombigas and earrings were handed down from antiquity and inherited from their ancestors  Gold dagger handles  gold dishes  tooth plating  and huge gold ornamets were also used  In Laszlo Legeza s  Tantric elements in pre Hispanic Philippines Gold Art   he mentioned that gold jewelry of Philippine origin was found in Ancient Egypt  According to Antonio Pigafetta  the people of Mindoro possessed great skill in mixing gold with other metals and gave it a natural and perfect appearance that could deceive even the best of silversmiths  The natives were also known for the jewelries made of other precious stones such as carnelian  agate and pearl  Some outstanding examples of Philippine jewelry included necklaces  belts  armlets and rings placed around the waist   1 6  The Americas  There are ancient  prehistoric copper mines along Lake Superior  and metallic copper was still found there  near the surface  in colonial times  Indians availed themselves of this copper starting at least 5 000 years ago   and copper tools  arrowheads  and other artifacts that were part of an extensive native trade network have been discovered  In addition  obsidian  flint  and other minerals were mined  worked  and traded  Early French explorers who encountered the sites made no use of the metals due to the difficulties of transporting them  but the copper was eventually traded throughout the continent along major river routes  In Saskatchewan  Canada  there also are ancient quartz mines near Waddy Lake and surrounding regions   In the early colonial history of the Americas   native gold and silver was quickly expropriated and sent back to Spain in fleets of gold  and silver laden galleons   the gold and silver mostly from mines in Central and South America  Turquoise dated at 700 A D  was mined in pre Columbian America  in the Cerillos Mining District in New Mexico  estimates are that  about 15 000 tons of rock had been removed from Mt  Chalchihuitl using stone tools before 1700    Mining in the United States became prevalent in the 19th century  and the General Mining Act of 1872 was passed to encourage mining of federal lands  As with the California Gold Rush in the mid 19th century  mining for minerals and precious metals  along with ranching  was a driving factor in the Westward Expansion to the Pacific coast  With the exploration of the West  mining camps were established and  expressed a distinctive spirit  an enduring legacy to the new nation   Gold Rushers would experience the same problems as the Land Rushers of the transient West that preceded them  Aided by railroads  many traveled West for work opportunities in mining  Western cities such as Denver and Sacramento originated as mining towns   As new areas were explored  it was usually the gold  placer and then load  and then silver that were taken first  with other metals often waiting for railroads or canals  Coarse gold dust and nuggets do not require smelting and are easy to identify and transport   1 7  Modern period  In the early 20th century  the gold and silver rush to the western United States also stimulated mining for base metals such as copper  lead  and iron as well as coal  Areas in modern Montana  Utah  Arizona  and later Alaska became predominate suppliers of copper to the world  which was increasingly demanding copper for electrical and households goods  Canada s mining industry grew more slowly than did the United States  due to limitations in transportation  capital  and U S  competition  Ontario was the major producer of the early 20th century with nickel  copper  and gold   Meanwhile  Australia experienced the Australian gold rushes and by the 1850s was producing 40% of the world s gold  followed by the establishment of large mines such as the Mount Morgan Mine  which ran for nearly a hundred years  Broken Hill ore deposit  one of the largest zinc lead ore deposits   and the iron ore mines at Iron Knob  After declines in production  another boom in mining occurred in the 1960s  Now  in the early 21st century  Australia remains a major world mineral producer   As the 21st century begins  a globalized mining industry of large multinational corporations has arisen  Peak minerals and environmental impacts have also become a concern  Different elements  particularly rare earth minerals  have begun to increase in demand as a result of new technologies   2  Mine development and lifecycle  The process of mining from discovery of an ore body through extraction of minerals and finally to returning the land to its natural state consists of several distinct steps  The first is discovery of the ore body  which is carried out through prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent  location and value of the ore body  This leads to a mathematical resource estimation to estimate the size and grade of the deposit   This estimation is used to conduct a pre feasibility study to determine the theoretical economics of the ore deposit  This identifies  early on  whether further investment in estimation and engineering studies is warranted and identifies key risks and areas for further work  The next step is to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the financial viability  the technical and financial risks  and the robustness of the project   This is when the mining company makes the decision whether to develop the mine or to walk away from the project  This includes mine planning to evaluate the economically recoverable portion of the deposit  the metallurgy and ore recoverability  marketability and payability of the ore concentrates  engineering concerns  milling and infrastructure costs  finance and equity requirements  and an analysis of the proposed mine from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation  The proportion of a deposit that is economically recoverable is dependent on the enrichment factor of the ore in the area   To gain access to the mineral deposit within an area it is often necessary to mine through or remove waste material which is not of immediate interest to the miner  The total movement of ore and waste constitutes the mining process  Often more waste than ore is mined during the life of a mine  depending on the nature and location of the ore body  Waste removal and placement is a major cost to the mining operator  so a detailed characterization of the waste material forms an essential part of the geological exploration program for a mining operation   Once the analysis determines a given ore body is worth recovering  development begins to create access to the ore body  The mine buildings and processing plants are built  and any necessary equipment is obtained  The operation of the mine to recover the ore begins and continues as long as the company operating the mine finds it economical to do so  Once all the ore that the mine can produce profitably is recovered  reclamation begins to make the land used by the mine suitable for future use   3  Mining techniques  Mining techniques can be divided into two common excavation types  surface mining and sub surface  underground  mining  Today  surface mining is much more common  and produces  for example  85% of minerals  excluding petroleum and natural gas  in the United States  including 98% of metallic ores   Targets are divided into two general categories of materials  placer deposits  consisting of valuable minerals contained within river gravels  beach sands  and other unconsolidated materials  and lode deposits  where valuable minerals are found in veins  in layers  or in mineral grains generally distributed throughout a mass of actual rock  Both types of ore deposit  placer or lode  are mined by both surface and underground methods   Some mining  including much of the rare earth elements and uranium mining  is done by less common methods  such as in situ leaching  this technique involves digging neither at the surface nor underground  The extraction of target minerals by this technique requires that they be soluble  e g   potash  potassium chloride  sodium chloride  sodium sulfate  which dissolve in water  Some minerals  such as copper minerals and uranium oxide  require acid or carbonate solutions to dissolve   3 1  Surface mining  Surface mining is done by removing  stripping  surface vegetation  dirt  and  if necessary  layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits  Techniques of surface mining include  open pit mining  which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground  quarrying or gathering building materials from an open pit mine  strip mining  which consists of stripping surface layers off to reveal ore seams underneath  and mountaintop removal  commonly associated with coal mining  which involves taking the top of a mountain off to reach ore deposits at depth  Most  but not all  placer deposits  because of their shallowly buried nature  are mined by surface methods  Finally  landfill mining involves sites where landfills are excavated and processed   3 2  Underground mining  Sub surface mining consists of digging tunnels or shafts into the earth to reach buried ore deposits  Ore  for processing  and waste rock  for disposal  are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts  Sub surface mining can be classified by the type of access shafts used  the extraction method or the technique used to reach the mineral deposit  Drift mining utilizes horizontal access tunnels  slope mining uses diagonally sloping access shafts  and shaft mining utilizes vertical access shafts  Mining in hard and soft rock formations require different techniques   Other methods include shrinkage stope mining  which is mining upward  creating a sloping underground room  long wall mining  which is grinding a long ore surface underground  and room and pillar mining  which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support the roof of the room  Room and pillar mining often leads to retreat mining  in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat  allowing the room to cave in  thereby loosening more ore  Additional sub surface mining methods include hard rock mining  which is mining of hard materials  bore hole mining  drift and fill mining  long hole slope mining  sub level caving  and block caving   4  Machines  Heavy machinery is used in mining to explore and develop sites  to remove and stockpile overburden  to break and remove rocks of various hardness and toughness  to process the ore  and to carry out reclamation projects after the mine is closed  Bulldozers  drills  explosives and trucks are all necessary for excavating the land  In the case of placer mining  unconsolidated gravel  or alluvium  is fed into machinery consisting of a hopper and a shaking screen or trommel which frees the desired minerals from the waste gravel  The minerals are then concentrated using sluices or jigs   Large drills are used to sink shafts  excavate stopes  and obtain samples for analysis  Trams are used to transport miners  minerals and waste  Lifts carry miners into and out of mines  and move rock and ore out  and machinery in and out  of underground mines  Huge trucks  shovels and cranes are employed in surface mining to move large quantities of overburden and ore  Processing plants utilize large crushers  mills  reactors  roasters and other equipment to consolidate the mineral rich material and extract the desired compounds and metals from the ore   5  Processing  Once the mineral is extracted  it is often then processed  The science of extractive metallurgy is a specialized area in the science of metallurgy that studies the extraction of valuable metals from their ores  especially through chemical or mechanical means   Mineral processing  or mineral dressing  is a specialized area in the science of metallurgy that studies the mechanical means of crushing  grinding  and washing that enable the separation  extractive metallurgy  of valuable metals or minerals from their gangue  waste material   Processing of placer ore material consists of gravity dependent methods of separation  such as sluice boxes  Only minor shaking or washing may be necessary to disaggregate  unclump  the sands or gravels before processing  Processing of ore from a lode mine  whether it is a surface or subsurface mine  requires that the rock ore be crushed and pulverized before extraction of the valuable minerals begins  After lode ore is crushed  recovery of the valuable minerals is done by one  or a combination of several  mechanical and chemical techniques   Since most metals are present in ores as oxides or sulfides  the metal needs to be reduced to its metallic form  This can be accomplished through chemical means such as smelting or through electrolytic reduction  as in the case of aluminium  Geometallurgy combines the geologic sciences with extractive metallurgy and mining   6  Environmental effects  Environmental issues can include erosion  formation of sinkholes  loss of biodiversity  and contamination of soil  groundwater and surface water by chemicals from mining processes  In some cases  additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to create space for the storage of the created debris and soil  Contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals can also affect the health of the local population if not properly controlled  Extreme examples of pollution from mining activities include coal fires  which can last for years or even decades  producing massive amounts of environmental damage   Mining companies in most countries are required to follow stringent environmental and rehabilitation codes in order to minimize environmental impact and avoid impacting human health  These codes and regulations all require the common steps of environmental impact assessment  development of environmental management plans  mine closure planning  which must be done before the start of mining operations   and environmental monitoring during operation and after closure  However  in some areas  particularly in the developing world  government regulations may not be well enforced   For major mining companies and any company seeking international financing  there are a number of other mechanisms to enforce good environmental standards  These generally relate to financing standards such as the Equator Principles  IFC environmental standards  and criteria for Socially responsible investing  Mining companies have used this oversight from the financial sector to argue for some level of self policing  In 1992  a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the Rio Earth Summit by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations  UNCTC   but the Business Council for Sustainable Development  BCSD  together with the International Chamber of Commerce  ICC  argued successfully for self regulation instead   This was followed by the Global Mining Initiative which was begun by nine of the largest metals and mining companies and which led to the formation of the International Council on Mining and Metals  whose purpose was to  act as a catalyst  in an effort to improve social and environmental performance in the mining and metals industry internationally  The mining industry has provided funding to various conservation groups  some of which have been working with conservation agendas that are at odds with an emerging acceptance of the rights of indigenous people – particularly the right to make land use decisions   Certification of mines with good practices occurs through the International Organization for Standardization  ISO   For example  ISO 9000 and ISO 14001  which certify an  auditable environmental management system   involve short inspections  although they have been accused of lacking rigor  Certification is also available through Ceres  Global Reporting Initiative  but these reports are voluntary and unverified  Miscellaneous other certification programs exist for various projects  typically through nonprofit groups   The purpose of a 2012 EPS PEAKS paper was to provide evidence on policies managing ecological costs and maximise socio economic benefits of mining using host country regulatory initiatives  It found existing literature suggesting donors encourage developing countries to   Make the environment poverty link and introduce cutting edge wealth measures and natural capital accounts   Reform old taxes in line with more recent financial innovation  engage directly with the companies  enacting land use and impact assessments  and incorporate specialised support and standards agencies   Set in play transparency and community participation initiatives using the wealth accrued   6 1  Waste  Ore mills generate large amounts of waste  called tailings  For example  99 tons of waste are generated per ton of copper  with even higher ratios in gold mining  These tailings can be toxic  Tailings  which are usually produced as a slurry  are most commonly dumped into ponds made from naturally existing valleys  These ponds are secured by impoundments  dams or embankment dams   In 2000 it was estimated that 3 500 tailings impoundments existed  and that every year  2 to 5 major failures and 35 minor failures occurred  for example  in the Marcopper mining disaster at least 2 million tons of tailings were released into a local river  Subaqueous tailings disposal is another option  The mining industry has argued that submarine tailings disposal  STD   which disposes of tailings in the sea  is ideal because it avoids the risks of tailings ponds  although the practice is illegal in the United States and Canada  it is used in the developing world   The waste is classified as either sterile or mineralised  with acid generating potential  and the movement and storage of this material forms a major part of the mine planning process  When the mineralised package is determined by an economic cut off  the near grade mineralised waste is usually dumped separately with view to later treatment should market conditions change and it becomes economically viable  Civil engineering design parameters are used in the design of the waste dumps  and special conditions apply to high rainfall areas and to seismically active areas  Waste dump designs must meet all regulatory requirements of the country in whose jurisdiction the mine is located  It is also common practice to rehabilitate dumps to an internationally acceptable standard  which in some cases means that higher standards than the local regulatory standard are applied   7  Mining industry  Mining exists in many countries  London is known as the capital of global  mining houses  such as Rio Tinto Group  BHP Billiton  and Anglo American PLC  The US mining industry is also large  but it is dominated by the coal and other nonmetal minerals  e g   rock and sand   and various regulations have worked to reduce the significance of mining in the United States  In 2007 the total market capitalization of mining companies was reported at US$962 billion  which compares to a total global market cap of publicly traded companies of about US$50 trillion in 2007  In 2002  Chile and Peru were reportedly the major mining countries of South America  The mineral industry of Africa includes the mining of various minerals  it produces relatively little of the industrial metals copper  lead  and zinc  but according to one estimate has as a percent of world reserves 40% of gold  60% of cobalt  and 90% of the world s platinum group metals  Mining in India is a significant part of that country s economy  In the developed world  mining in Australia  with BHP Billiton founded and headquartered in the country  and mining in Canada are particularly significant  For rare earth minerals mining  China reportedly controlled 95% of production in 2013  While exploration and mining can be conducted by individual entrepreneurs or small businesses  most modern day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish  Consequently  the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large  often multinational  companies  most of them publicly listed  It can be argued that what is referred to as the  mining industry  is actually two sectors  one specializing in exploration for new resources and the other in mining those resources  The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies  called  juniors   which are dependent on venture capital  The mining sector is made up of large multinational companies that are sustained by production from their mining operations  Various other industries such as equipment manufacture  environmental testing  and metallurgy analysis rely on  and support  the mining industry throughout the world  Canadian stock exchanges have a particular focus on mining companies  particularly junior exploration companies through Toronto sTSX Venture Exchange  Canadian companies raise capital on these exchanges and then invest the money in exploration globally  Some have argued that below juniors there exists a substantial sector of illegitimate companies primarily focused on manipulating stock prices   Mining operations can be grouped into five major categories in terms of their respective resources  These are oil and gas extraction  coal mining  metal ore mining  nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying  and mining support activities  Of all of these categories  oil and gas extraction remains one of the largest in terms of its global economic importance  Prospecting potential mining sites  a vital area of concern for the mining industry  is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as seismic prospecting and remote sensing satellites  Mining is heavily affected by the prices of the commodity minerals  which are often volatile  The 2000s commodities boom   commodities supercycle   increased the prices of commodities  driving aggressive mining  In addition  the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s  which increased gold mining  for example  one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased six fold from the period 2003–2006  292 ha yr  to the period 2006–2009  1 915 ha yr   largely due to artisanal mining   7 1  Corporate classifications  Mining companies can be classified based on their size and financial capabilities   Major companies are considered to have an adjusted annual mining related revenue of more than US$500 million  with the financial capability to develop a major mine on its own   Intermediate companies have at least $50 million in annual revenue but less than $500 million   Junior companies rely on equity financing as their principal means of funding exploration  Juniors are mainly pure exploration companies  but may also produce minimally  and do not have a revenue exceeding US$50 million   7 2  Regulation and governance  New regulation and process of legislative reforms aims to enrich the harmonization and stability of the mining sector in mineral rich countries  The new legislation for mining industry in the African countries still appears as an emerging issue with a potential to be solved  until a consensus is reached on the best approach  By the beginning of 20th century the booming and more complex mining sector in mineral rich countries provided only slight benefits to local communities in terms of sustainability  Increasing debates and influence by NGOs and communities appealed for a new program which would have had also included a disadvantaged communities  and would have had worked towards sustainable development even after mine closure  included transparency and revenue management   By the early 2000s  community development issues and resettlements became mainstreamed in Bank mining projects  Mining industry expansion after an increase of mineral prices in 2003 and also potential fiscal revenues in those countries created an omission in the other economic sectors in terms of finances and development  Furthermore  it had highlighted regional and local demand of mining revenues and lack of ability of sub national governments to use the revenues  The Fraser Institute  a Canadian think tank  has highlighted the environmental protection laws in developing countries  as well as the voluntary efforts by mining companies to improve their environmental impact   In 2007 the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative  EITI  was mainstreamed in all countries cooperating with the World Bank in mining industry reform  The EITI is operating and implementing with a support of EITI Multi Donor Trust Fund  managed by The World Bank  The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative  EITI  aims to increase transparency in transactions between governments and companies within extractive industries by monitoring the revenues and benefits between industries and recipient governments  The entrance process is voluntary for each country and is being monitored by multi stakeholders involving government  private companies and civil society representatives  responsible for disclosure and dissemination of the reconciliation report  however  the competitive disadvantage of company by company public report is for some of the businesses in Ghana  the main constraint  Therefore  the outcome assessment in terms of failure or success of the new EITI regulation does not only  rest on the government s shoulders  but also on civil society and companies   On the other hand  criticism points out two main implementation issues  inclusion or exclusion of artisanal mining and small scale mining  ASM  from the EITI and how to deal with “non cash” payments made by companies to subnational governments  Furthermore  disproportion of the revenues mining industry creates to the comparatively small number of people that it employs  causes another controversy  The issue of artisanal mining is clearly an issue in EITI Countries such as the Central African Republic  D R  Congo  Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone – i e  almost half of the mining countries implementing the EITI  Among other things  limited scope of the EITI involving disparity in terms of knowledge of the industry and negotiation skills  thus far flexibility of the policy  e g  liberty of the countries to expand beyond the minimum requirements and adapt it to their needs   creates another risk of unsuccessful implementation  Public awareness increase  where government should act as a bridge between public and initiative for a successful outcome of the policy is an important element to be considered   7 3  World Bank  The World Bank has been involved in mining since 1955  mainly through grants from its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  with the Bank s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency offering political risk insurance  Between 1955 and 1990 it provided about $2 billion to fifty mining projects  broadly categorized as reform and rehabilitation  greenfield mine construction  mineral processing  technical assistance  and engineering  These projects have been criticized  particularly the Ferro Carajas project of Brazil  begun in 1981  The World Bank established mining codes intended to increase foreign investment  in 1988 it solicited feedback from 45 mining companies on how to increase their involvement   In 1992 the World Bank began to push for privatization of government owned mining companies with a new set of codes  beginning with its report The Strategy for African Mining  In 1997  Latin America s largest miner Companhia Vale do Rio Doce  CVRD  was privatized  These and other developments such as the Philippines 1995 Mining Act led the bank to publish a third report  Assistance for Minerals Sector Development and Reform in Member Countries  which endorsed mandatory environment impact assessments and attention to the concerns of the local population  The codes based on this report are influential in the legislation of developing nations  The new codes are intended to encourage development through tax holidays  zero custom duties  reduced income taxes  and related measures  The results of these codes were analyzed by a group from the University of Quebec  which concluded that the codes promote foreign investment but  fall very short of permitting sustainable development   The observed negative correlation between natural resources and economic development is known as the resource curse   8  Safety  Safety has long been a concern in the mining business especially in sub surface mining  The Courrières mine disaster  Europe s worst mining accident  involved the death of 1 099 miners in Northern France on March 10  1906  This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26  1942  which killed 1 549 miners  While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades  mining accidents still occur  Government figures indicate that 5 000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year  while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20 000  Mining accidents continue worldwide  including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia  the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China  and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States   Mining ventilation is a significant safety concern for many miners  Poor ventilation inside sub surface mines causes exposure to harmful gases  heat  and dust  which can cause illness  injury  and death  The concentration of methane and other airborne contaminants underground can generally be controlled by dilution  ventilation   capture before entering the host air stream  methane drainage   or isolation  seals and stoppings   Rock dusts  including coal dust and silicon dust  can cause long term lung problems including silicosis  asbestosis  and pneumoconiosis  also known as miners lung or black lung disease   A ventilation system is set up to force a stream of air through the working areas of the mine  The air circulation necessary for effective ventilation of a mine is generated by one or more large mine fans  usually located above ground  Air flows in one direction only  making circuits through the mine such that each main work area constantly receives a supply of fresh air  Watering down in coal mines also helps to keep dust levels down  by spraying the machine with water and filtering the dust laden water with a scrubber fan  miners can successfully trap the dust   Gases in mines can poison the workers or displace the oxygen in the mine  causing asphyxiation  For this reason  the U S  Mine Safety and Health Administration requires that groups of miners in the United States carry gas detection equipment that can detect common gases  such as CO  O2  H2S  CH4  as well as calculate % Lower Explosive Limit  Regulation requires that all production stop if there is a concentration of 1 4% of flammable gas present  Additionally  further regulation is being requested for more gas detection as newer technology such as nanotechnology is introduced   Ignited methane gas is a common source of explosions in coal mines  which in turn can initiate more extensive coal dust explosions  For this reason  rock dusts such as limestone dust are spread throughout coal mines to diminish the chances of coal dust explosions as well as to limit the extent of potential explosions  in a process known as rock dusting  Coal dust explosions can also begin independently of methane gas explosions  Frictional heat and sparks generated by mining equipment can ignite both methane gas and coal dust  For this reason  water is often used to cool rock cutting sites   Miners utilize equipment strong enough to break through extremely hard layers of the Earth s crust  This equipment  combined with the closed work space in which underground miners work  can cause hearing loss  For example  a roof bolter  commonly used by mine roof bolter operators  can reach sound power levels of up to 115 dB  Combined with the reverberant effects of underground mines  a miner without proper hearing protection is at a high risk for hearing loss  By age 50  nearly 90% of U S  coal miners have some hearing loss  compared to only 10% among workers not exposed to loud noises  Roof bolters are among the loudest machines  but auger miners  bulldozers  continuous mining machines  front end loaders  and shuttle cars and trucks are also among those machines most responsible for excessive noise in mine work   Since mining entails removing dirt and rock from its natural location  thereby creating large empty pits  rooms  and tunnels  cave ins as well as ground and rock falls are a major concern within mines  Modern techniques for timbering and bracing walls and ceilings within sub surface mines have reduced the number of fatalities due to cave ins  but ground falls continue to represent up to 50% of mining fatalities  Even in cases where mine collapses are not instantly fatal  they can trap mine workers deep underground  Cases such as these often lead to high profile rescue efforts  such as when 33 Chilean miners were trapped deep underground for 69 days in 2010   High temperatures and humidity may result in heat related illnesses  including heat stroke  which can be fatal  The presence of heavy equipment in confined spaces also poses a risk to miners  To improve the safety of mine workers  modern mines use automation and remote operation including  for example  such equipment as automated loaders and remotely operated rockbreakers  However  despite modern improvements to safety practices  mining remains a dangerous occupation throughout the world   8 1  Abandoned mines  There are upwards of 560 000 abandoned mines on public and privately owned lands in the United States alone  Abandoned mines may be dangerous to anyone who attempts to explore them without proper knowledge and safety training   9  Records  As of 2008  the deepest mine in the world is TauTona in Carletonville  South Africa at   replacing the neighboring Savuka Mine in the North West Province of South Africa at   East Rand Mine in Boksburg  South Africa briefly held the record at   and the first mine declared the deepest in the world was also TauTona when it was at    The Moab Khutsong gold mine in North West Province  South Africa  has the world s longest winding steel wire rope  able to lower workers to in one uninterrupted four minute journey   The deepest mine in Europe is the 16th shaft of the uranium mines in Příbram  Czech Republic at   second is Bergwerk Saar in Saarland  Germany at    The deepest open pit mine in the world is Bingham Canyon Mine in Bingham Canyon  Utah  United States at over   The largest and second deepest open pit copper mine in the world is Chuquicamata in Chuquicamata  Chile at   940 600 tons of copper and 17 700 tons of molybdenum produced annually   The deepest open pit mine with respect to sea level is Tagebau Hambach in Germany  where the base of the pit is below sea level   The largest underground mine is Kiirunavaara Mine in Kiruna  Sweden  With of roads  40 million tonnes of ore produced yearly  and a depth of   it is also one of the most modern underground mines  The deepest borehole in the world is Kola Superdeep Borehole at   This  however  is not a matter of mining but rather related to scientific drilling   10  Metal reserves and recycling  During the twentieth century  the variety of metals used in society grew rapidly  Today  the development of major nations such as China and India and advances in technologies are fueling an ever greater demand  The result is that metal mining activities are expanding and more and more of the world’s metal stocks are above ground in use rather than below ground as unused reserves  An example is the in use stock of copper  Between 1932 and 1999  copper in use in the USA rose from to per person   95% of the energy used to make aluminium from bauxite ore is saved by using recycled material  However  levels of metals recycling are generally low  In 2010  the International Resource Panel  hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme  UNEP   published reports on metal stocks that exist within society and their recycling rates   The report s authors observed that the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground  However  they warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones  battery packs for hybrid cars  and fuel cells are so low that unless future end of life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology   11  See also  Outline of mining  Asteroid mining  Automated mining  Environmental impact of mining
