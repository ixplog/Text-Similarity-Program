In the philosophy of mathematics  intuitionism  or neointuitionism  opposed to preintuitionism   is an approach where mathematics is considered to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an objective reality  That is  logic and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs  regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality   1  Truth and proof  The fundamental distinguishing characteristic of intuitionism is its interpretation of what it means for a mathematical statement to be true  In Brouwer s original intuitionism  the truth of a mathematical statement is a subjective claim  a mathematical statement corresponds to a mental construction  and a mathematician can assert the truth of a statement only by verifying the validity of that construction by intuition  The vagueness of the intuitionistic notion of truth often leads to misinterpretations about its meaning  Kleene formally defined intuitionistic truth from a realist position  yet Brouwer would likely reject this formalization as meaningless  given his rejection of the realist Platonist position  Intuitionistic truth therefore remains somewhat ill defined  However  because the intuitionistic notion of truth is more restrictive than that of classical mathematics  the intuitionist must reject some assumptions of classical logic to ensure that everything he proves is in fact intuitionistically true  This gives rise to intuitionistic logic   To an intuitionist  the claim that an object with certain properties exists is a claim that an object with those properties can be constructed  Any mathematical object is considered to be a product of a construction of a mind  and therefore  the existence of an object is equivalent to the possibility of its construction  This contrasts with the classical approach  which states that the existence of an entity can be proved by refuting its non existence  For the intuitionist  this is not valid  the refutation of the non existence does not mean that it is possible to find a construction for the putative object  as is required in order to assert its existence  Existence is construction  not proof of non existence  Fenstad   As such  intuitionism is a variety of mathematical constructivism  but it is not the only kind   The interpretation of negation is different in intuitionist logic than in classical logic  In classical logic  the negation of a statement asserts that the statement is false  to an intuitionist  it means the statement is refutable  e g   that there is a counterexample   There is thus an asymmetry between a positive and negative statement in intuitionism  If a statement P is provable  then it is certainly impossible to prove that there is no proof of P  But even if it can be shown that no disproof of P is possible  we cannot conclude from this absence that there is a proof of P  Thus P is a stronger statement than not not P   Similarly  to assert that A or B holds  to an intuitionist  is to claim that either A or B can be proved  In particular  the law of excluded middle   A or not A   is not accepted as a valid principle  For example  if A is some mathematical statement that an intuitionist has not yet proved or disproved  then that intuitionist will not assert the truth of  A or not A   However  the intuitionist will accept that  A and not A  cannot be true  Thus the connectives  and  and  or  of intuitionistic logic do not satisfy de Morgan s laws as they do in classical logic   Intuitionistic logic substitutes constructability for abstract truth and is associated with a transition from the proof to model theory of abstract truth in modern mathematics  The logical calculus preserves justification  rather than truth  across transformations yielding derived propositions  It has been taken as giving philosophical support to several schools of philosophy  most notably the Anti realism of Michael Dummett  Thus  contrary to the first impression its name might convey  and as realized in specific approaches and disciplines  e g  Fuzzy Sets and Systems   intuitionist mathematics is more rigorous than conventionally founded mathematics  where  ironically  the foundational elements which Intuitionism attempts to construct refute refound are taken as intuitively given   2  Intuitionism and infinity  Among the different formulations of intuitionism  there are several different positions on the meaning and reality of infinity   The term potential infinity refers to a mathematical procedure in which there is an unending series of steps  After each step has been completed  there is always another step to be performed  For example  consider the process of counting   The term actual infinity refers to a completed mathematical object which contains an infinite number of elements  An example is the set of natural numbers   In Cantor s formulation of set theory  there are many different infinite sets  some of which are larger than others  For example  the set of all real numbers R is larger than N  because any procedure that you attempt to use to put the natural numbers into one to one correspondence with the real numbers will always fail  there will always be an infinite number of real numbers  left over   Any infinite set that can be placed in one to one correspondence with the natural numbers is said to be  countable  or  denumerable   Infinite sets larger than this are said to be  uncountable    Cantor s set theory led to the axiomatic system of ZFC  now the most common foundation of modern mathematics  Intuitionism was created  in part  as a reaction to Cantor s set theory   Modern constructive set theory does include the axiom of infinity from Zermelo Fraenkel set theory  or a revised version of this axiom   and includes the set N of natural numbers  Most modern constructive mathematicians accept the reality of countably infinite sets  however  see Alexander Esenin Volpin for a counter example    Brouwer rejected the concept of actual infinity  but admitted the idea of potential infinity   Finitism is an extreme version of Intuitionism that rejects the idea of potential infinity  According to Finitism  a mathematical object does not exist unless it can be constructed from the natural numbers in a finite number of steps   3  History of Intuitionism  Intuitionism s history can be traced to two controversies in nineteenth century mathematics   The first of these was the invention of transfinite arithmetic by Georg Cantor and its subsequent rejection by a number of prominent mathematicians including most famously his teacher Leopold Kronecker — a confirmed finitist   The second of these was Gottlob Frege s effort to reduce all of mathematics to a logical formulation via set theory and its derailing by a youthful Bertrand Russell  the discoverer of Russell s paradox  Frege had planned a three volume definitive work  but shortly after the first volume had been published  Russell sent Frege a letter outlining his paradox which demonstrated that one of Frege s rules of self reference was self contradictory   Frege  the story goes  plunged into depression and did not publish the second and third volumes of his work as he had planned  For more see Davis  2000  Chapters 3 and 4  Frege  From Breakthrough to Despair and Cantor  Detour through Infinity  See van Heijenoort for the original works and van Heijenoort s commentary   These controversies are strongly linked as the logical methods used by Cantor in proving his results in transfinite arithmetic are essentially the same as those used by Russell in constructing his paradox  Hence how one chooses to resolve Russell s paradox has direct implications on the status accorded to Cantor s transfinite arithmetic   In the early twentieth century L  E  J  Brouwer represented the intuitionist position and David Hilbert the formalist position — see van Heijenoort  Kurt Gödel offered opinions referred to as Platonist  see various sources re Gödel   Alan Turing considers   non constructive
