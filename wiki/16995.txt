Kundalini  Sanskrit       stems from yogic philosophy as a form of shakti or  corporeal energy   Kundalini is described within Eastern religious  or spiritual tradition as an indwelling spiritual energy that can be awakened in order to purify the subtle system and ultimately to bestow the state of Yoga  or divine union upon the seeker of truth  The Yoga Upanishads describe Kundalini as lying  coiled  at the base of the spine  represented as either a goddess or sleeping serpent waiting to be awakened  In modern commentaries  Kundalini has been called an unconscious  instinctive or libidinal force   It is reported that Kundalini awakening results in deep meditation  enlightenment and bliss  This awakening involves the Kundalini physically moving up the central channel to reside within the Sahasrara Chakra at the top of the head  This movement of Kundalini is felt by the presence of a cool or  in the case of imbalance  a warm breeze across the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet  Many systems of yoga focus on the awakening of Kundalini through meditation  pranayama breathing  the practice of asana and chanting of mantras  In physical terms  one commonly reports the Kundalini experience to be a feeling of electric current running along the spine   Some academics have coined the term  Kundalini syndrome  to refer to physical or psychological problems arising from experiences traditionally associated with Kundalini awakening   1  Etymology  The concept of  Kundalini  is mentioned in Upanishads  9th century BCE   3rd century BCE   The Sanskrit adjective means  circular  annular   It does occur as a noun for  a snake   in the sense  coiled   as in  forming ringlets   in the 12th century Rajatarangini chronicle  I 2     a noun with the meaning  bowl  water pot  is found as the name of a Naga in Mahabharata 1 4828  The 8th century Tantrasadbhava Tantra uses the term kundalī   ring  bracelet  coil  of a rope      The use of kuṇḍalī as a name of Durga or of a Shakti appears as a technical term in Tantrism and Shaktism as early as c  the 11th century  in the Śaradatilaka  It is adopted as kuṇḍalniī as a technical term into Hatha yoga in the 15th century and becomes widely used in the Yoga Upanishads by the 16th century  Eknath Easwaran has paraphrased the term as  the coiled power   a force which ordinarily rests at the base of the spine  described as being  coiled there like a serpent   The phrase serpent power was coined by Sir John Woodroffe  who published his translation of two 16th century treatises on laya yoga  Kundalini yoga  in 1919 under this title   2  Description  Kundalini is described as a sleeping  dormant potential force in the human organism  It is one of the components of an esoteric description of the  subtle body   which consists of nadis  energy channels   chakras  psychic centres   prana  subtle energy   and bindu  drops of essence    Kundalini is described as being coiled up at the base of the spine  The description of the location can vary slightly  from the rectum to the navel  Kundalini is said to reside in the triangular shaped sacrum bone in three and a half coils   Kundalini has been described as  a residual power of pure desire  by Nirmala Srivastava and  a huge volume of energy  that is latent within a person by Jaggi Vasudev   3  Kundalini awakening  Kundalini can be awakened by shaktipat舒spiritual transmission by a Guru or teacher舒or by spiritual practices such as yoga or meditation  Sometimes Kundalini reportedly awakens spontaneously as the result of physical or psychological trauma  or even for no apparent reason  When awakened  Kundalini is said to rise up from the muladhara chakra through the central nadi  called sushumna  inside or alongside the spine and reaching the top of the head  The progress of Kundalini through the different chakras leads to different levels of awakening and mystical experience  until Kundalini finally reaches the top of the head  Sahasrara or crown chakra  producing an extremely profound mystical experience   Numerous accounts describe the experience of Kundalini   Ramana Maharshi mentioned that Kundalini is nothing but the natural energy of the Self  where Self is the universal consciousness  Paramatma  present in every being  and that the individual mind of thoughts cloaks this natural energy from unadulterated expression  Advaita teaches self realization  enlightenment  God consciousness  and nirvana  But  initial Kundalini awakening is just the beginning of actual spiritual experience  Self inquiry meditation is considered a very natural and simple means of reaching this goal   Swami Vivekananda described Kundalini briefly in London during his lectures on Raja Yoga as follows   According to the Yogis  there are two nerve currents in the spinal column  called Pingalâ and Idâ  and a hollow canal called Sushumnâ running through the spinal cord  At the lower end of the hollow canal is what the Yogis call the  Lotus of the Kundalini   They describe it as triangular in form in which  in the symbolical language of the Yogis  there is a power called the Kundalini  coiled up  When that Kundalini awakes  it tries to force a passage through this hollow canal  and as it rises step by step  as it were  layer after layer of the mind becomes open and all the different visions and wonderful powers come to the Yogi  When it reaches the brain  the Yogi is perfectly detached from the body and mind  the soul finds itself free  We know that the spinal cord is composed in a peculiar manner  If we take the figure eight horizontally  ∞  there are two parts which are connected in the middle  Suppose you add eight after eight  piled one on top of the other  that will represent the spinal cord  The left is the Ida  the right Pingala  and that hollow canal which runs through the centre of the spinal cord is the Sushumna  Where the spinal cord ends in some of the lumbar vertebrae  a fine fibre issues downwards  and the canal runs up even within that fibre  only much finer  The canal is closed at the lower end  which is situated near what is called the sacral plexus  which  according to modern physiology  is triangular in form  The different plexuses that have their centres in the spinal canal can very well stand for the different  lotuses  of the Yogi  When Kundalini Shakti is conceived as a goddess  then  when it rises to the head  it unites itself with the Supreme Being  Lord Shiva   Then the aspirant becomes engrossed in deep meditation and infinite bliss  Paramahansa Yogananda in his book God Talks With Arjuna  The Bhagavad Gita states   At the command of the yogi in deep meditation  this creative force turns inward and flows back to its source in the thousand petaled lotus  revealing the resplendent inner world of the divine forces and consciousness of the soul and Spirit  Yoga refers to this power flowing from the coccyx to Spirit as the awakened kundalini  and The yogi reverses the searchlights of intelligence  mind and life force inward through a secret astral passage  the coiled way of the kundalini in the coccygeal plexus  and upward through the sacral  the lumbar  and the higher dorsal  cervical  and medullary plexuses  and the spiritual eye at the point between the eyebrows  to reveal finally the soul s presence in the highest center  sahasrara  in the brain  In his article on Kundalini in the Yoga Journal  David Eastman narrates two personal experiences  One man said he felt an activity at the base of his spine starting to flow so he relaxed and allowed it to happen  A feeling of surging energy began traveling up his back  at each chakra he felt an orgasmic electric feeling like every nerve trunk on his spine beginning to fire  A second man describes a similar experience but accompanied by a wave of euphoria and happiness softly permeating his being  He described the surging energy as being like electricity but hot  traveling from the base of his spine to the top of his head  He said the more he analyzed the experience  the less it occurred   Shiv R  Jhawar describes his Kundalini awakening experience in the physical presence of Muktananda   The arousing of Kundalini is said by some to be the one and only way of attaining divine wisdom  Self realization is said to be equivalent to divine wisdom  gnosis or self knowledge   3 1  Different approaches  There are two broad approaches to Kundalini awakening  active and passive  The active approach involves systematic physical exercises and techniques of concentration  visualization  pranayama  breath practice  and meditation under the guidance of a competent teacher  These techniques come from any of the four main branches of yoga  and some forms of yoga  such as Kriya yoga  Kundalini yoga and Sahaja yoga emphasize Kundalini techniques   The passive approach is instead a path of surrender where one lets go of all the impediments to the awakening rather than trying to actively awaken Kundalini  A chief part of the passive approach is shaktipat where one individual s Kundalini is awakened by another who already has the experience  Shaktipat only raises Kundalini temporarily but gives the student an experience to use as a basis   3 1 1  Hatha yoga  According to the hatha yoga text  the Goraksasataka  or  Hundred Verses of Goraksa   certain hatha yoga practices including mula bandha  uddiyana bandha  jalandhara bandha and kumbhaka can awaken Kundalini  Another hathayoga text  the Khecarīvidyā  states that kechari mudra enables one to raise Kundalini and access various stores of amrita in the head  which subsequently flood the body   3 1 2  Shaktipat  The spiritual teacher Meher Baba emphasized the need for a master when actively trying to awaken Kundalini   Kundalini is a latent power in the higher body  When awakened it pierces through six chakras or functional centres and activates them  Without a master  awakening of the kundalini cannot take any one very far on the Path  and such indiscriminate or premature awakening is fraught with dangers of self deception as well as misuse of powers  The kundalini enables man consciously to cross the lower planes and it ultimately merges into the universal cosmic power of which it is a part  and which also is at times described as kundalini     The important point is that the awakened kundalini is helpful only up to a certain degree  after which it cannot ensure further progress  It cannot dispense with the need for the grace of a Perfect Master   3 2  Kundalini awakening while prepared or unprepared  The experience of Kundalini awakening can happen when one is either prepared or unprepared   3 2 1  Preparedness  According to Hindu tradition  in order to be able to integrate this spiritual energy  a period of careful purification and strengthening of the body and nervous system is usually required beforehand  Yoga and Tantra propose that Kundalini can be awakened by a guru  teacher   but body and spirit must be prepared by yogic austerities such as pranayama  or breath control  physical exercises  visualization  and chanting  Patañjali emphasised a firm ethical and moral foundation to ensure the aspirant is comfortable with a reasonable degree of discipline and has a serious intention to awaken their full potential  The student is advised to follow the path in an openhearted manner   Traditionally people would visit ashrams in India to awaken their dormant kundalini energy  Typical activities would include regular meditation  mantra chanting  spiritual studies as well as a physical asana practice such as kundalini yoga  However  kundalini is now widely known outside of the Hindu religion and many cultures globally have created their own ways to awaken the kundalini energy within people  Without explanation  an increasingly large percentage of people are experiencing kundalini energy awakenings spontaneously which means  it is not vital to follow a distinct set of instructions or rules in order to awaken the energy   3 2 2  Unpreparedness  Kundalini can also awaken spontaneously  for no obvious reason or triggered by intense personal experiences such as accidents  near death experiences  childbirth  emotional trauma  extreme mental stress  and so on  Some sources attribute spontaneous awakenings to the  grace of God   or possibly to spiritual practice in past lives   A spontaneous awakening in one who is unprepared or without the assistance of a good teacher can result in an experience which has been termed as  Kundalini crisis    spiritual emergency  or  Kundalini syndrome   The symptoms are said to resemble those of Kundalini awakening but are experienced as unpleasant  overwhelming or out of control  Unpleasant side effects are said to occur when the practitioner has not approached Kundalini with due respect and in a narrow egotistical manner  Kundalini has been described as a highly creative intelligence which dwarfs our own  Kundalini awakening therefore requires surrender  it is not an energy which can be manipulated by the ego   3 3  Physical and psychological effects  Physical effects are believed to be a sign of Kundalini awakening by some  but described as unwanted side effects pointing to a problem rather than progress by others  The following are either common signs of an awakened Kundalini or symptoms of a problem associated with an awakening Kundalini  commonly referred to as Kundalini syndrome    Involuntary jerks  tremors  shaking  itching  tingling  and crawling sensations  especially in the arms and legs  Energy rushes or feelings of electricity circulating the body  Intense heat  sweating  or cold  especially as energy is experienced passing through the chakras  Spontaneous pranayama  asanas  mudras and bandhas  Visions or sounds at times associated with a particular chakra  Diminished or conversely extreme sexual desire sometimes leading to a state of constant or whole body orgasm  Emotional upheavals or surfacing of unwanted and repressed feelings or thoughts with certain repressed emotions becoming dominant in the conscious mind for short or long periods of time   Headache  migraine  or pressure inside the skull  Increased blood pressure and irregular heartbeat  Emotional numbness  Antisocial tendencies  Mood swings with periods of depression or mania  Pains in different areas of the body  especially back and neck  Sensitivity to light  sound  and touch  Trance like and altered states of consciousness  Disrupted sleep pattern  periods of insomnia or oversleeping   Loss of appetite or overeating  Bliss  feelings of infinite love and universal connectivity  transcendent awareness Reports about the Sahaja Yoga technique of Kundalini awakening state that the practice can result in a cool breeze felt on the fingertips as well as on the fontanel bone area  One study has measured a drop in temperature on the palms of the hands resulting from this technique   4  Western interpretation  Kundalini is considered an interaction of the subtle body along with chakra energy centers and nadis channels  Each chakra is said to contain special characteristics and with proper training  moving Kundalini through these chakras can help express or open these characteristics   Sir John Woodroffe  pen name Arthur Avalon  was one of the first to bring the notion of Kundalini to the West  As High Court Judge in Calcutta  he became interested in Shaktism and Hindu Tantra  His translation of and commentary on two key texts was published as The Serpent Power  Woodroffe rendered Kundalini as  Serpent Power  for lack of a better term in the English language but  kundala  in Sanskrit means  coiled    Western awareness of the idea of kundalini was strengthened by the Theosophical Society and interest by the psychiatrist Carl Jung  1875–1961    Jung s seminar on Kundalini yoga  presented to the Psychological Club in Zurich in 1932  has been widely regarded as a milestone in the psychological understanding of Eastern thought  Kundalini yoga presented Jung with a model for the development of higher consciousness  and he interpreted its symbols in terms of the process of individuation  The founder of the Aetherius Society George King describes the concept of Kundalini throughout his works and claimed to have experienced this energy many times throughout his life while in a  positive samadhic yogic trance state   According to King   It should always be remembered that despite appearances to the contrary  the complete control of Kundalini through the spinal column is man s only reason for being on Earth  for when this is accomplished  the lessons in this classroom and the mystical examination is passed  In his lecture entitled The Psychic Centers – Their Significance and Development he describes the theory behind the raising of Kundalini and how this might be done safely in the context of a balanced life devoted to selfless service   Sri Aurobindo was the other great authority scholar on Kundalini parallel to Woodroffe  with a somewhat different viewpoint  according to Mary Scott  who is herself a latter day scholar on Kundalini and its physical basis  and was a member of the Theosophical Society   Another populariser of the concept of Kundalini among Western readers was Gopi Krishna  His autobiography is entitled Kundalini  The Evolutionary Energy in Man  According to one writer his writings influenced Western interest in Kundalini yoga   In the early 1930s two Italian scholars  Tommaso Palamidessi and Julius Evola  published several books with the intent of re interpreting alchemy with reference to yoga  Those works had an impact on modern interpretations of Alchemy as a mystical science  In those works  Kundalini is called an  Igneous Power  or  Serpentine Fire    Other well known spiritual teachers who have made use of the idea of Kundalini include Albert Rudolph  Rudi   Harbhajan Singh Yogi  Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh  Osho   George Gurdjieff  Paramahansa Yogananda  Sivananda Radha Saraswati who produced an English language guide of Kundalini yoga methods  Muktananda  Bhagawan Nityananda  Nirmala Srivastava  Samael Aun Weor   4 1  New Age  Kundalini references may be found in a number of New Age presentations  and is a word that has been adopted by many new religious movements   4 2  Psychiatry  Recently  there has been a growing interest within the medical community to study the physiological effects of meditation  and some of these studies have applied the discipline of Kundalini yoga to their clinical settings  Some modern experimental research seeks to establish links between Kundalini practice and the ideas of Wilhelm Reich and his followers   The popularization of eastern spiritual practices has been associated with psychological problems in the west  Psychiatric literature notes that  since the influx of eastern spiritual practices and the rising popularity of meditation starting in the 1960s  many people have experienced a variety of psychological difficulties  either while engaged in intensive spiritual practice or spontaneously   Among the psychological difficulties associated with intensive spiritual practice we find  Kundalini awakening    a complex physio psychospiritual transformative process described in the yogic tradition   Researchers in the fields of Transpersonal psychology  and Near death studies have described a complex pattern of sensory  motor  mental and affective symptoms associated with the concept of Kundalini  sometimes called the Kundalini syndrome   According to the psychiatrist Carl Jung       the concept of Kundalini has for us only one use  that is  to describe our own experiences with the unconscious       The differentiation between spiritual emergency associated with Kundalini awakening may be viewed as an acute psychotic episode by psychiatrists who are not conversant with the culture  The biological changes of increased P300 amplitudes that occurs with certain yogic practices may lead to acute psychosis  Biological alterations by Yogic techniques may be used to warn people against such reactions   5  Notes  6  Further reading  7  External links
