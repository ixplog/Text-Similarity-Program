Reincarnation is the religious or philosophical concept that the soul or spirit  after biological death  can begin a new life in a new body  This doctrine is a central tenet of the Indian religions  It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as Spiritism  Theosophy  and Eckankar and is found in many tribal societies around the world  in places such as Siberia  West Africa  North America  and Australia   Although the majority of sects within the Abrahamic religions of Judaism  Christianity  and Islam do not believe that individuals reincarnate  particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation  these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of Kabbalah  the Cathars  the Druze and the Rosicrucians  The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of Neoplatonism  Orphism  Hermeticism  Manicheanism and Gnosticism of the Roman era  as well as the Indian religions  has been the subject of recent scholarly research   In recent decades  many Europeans and North Americans have developed an interest in reincarnation  Contemporary films  books  and popular songs frequently mention reincarnation   1  Conceptual definitions  The word  reincarnation  derives from Latin  literally meaning   entering the flesh again   The Greek equivalent metempsychosis  μετεμψύχωσις  roughly corresponds to the common English phrase  transmigration of the soul  and also usually connotes reincarnation after death  as either human  animal  though emphasising the continuity of the soul  not the flesh  The term has been used by modern philosophers such as Kurt Gödel and has entered the English language  Another Greek term sometimes used synonymously is palingenesis   being born again    There is no word corresponding exactly to the English terms  rebirth    metempsychosis    transmigration  or  reincarnation  in the traditional languages of Pāli and Sanskrit  The entire universal process that gives rise to the cycle of death and rebirth  governed by karma  is referred to as Samsara while the state one is born into  the individual process of being born or coming into the world in any way  is referred to simply as  birth   jāti   Devas  gods  may also die and live again  Here the term  reincarnation  is not strictly applicable  yet Hindu gods are said to have reincarnated  see Avatar   Lord Vishnu is known for his ten incarnations  the Dashavatars  Celtic religion seems to have had reincarnating gods also  Many Christians regard Jesus as a divine incarnation  Some Christians and Muslims believe he and some prophets may incarnate again  Most Christians  however  believe that Jesus will come again in the Second Coming at the end of the world  although this is not a reincarnation  Some ghulat Shi a Muslim sects also regard their founders as in some special sense divine incarnations  hulul    Philosophical and religious beliefs regarding the existence or non existence of an unchanging  self  have a direct bearing on how reincarnation is viewed within a given tradition  The Buddha lived at a time of great philosophical creativity in India when many conceptions of the nature of life and death were proposed  Some were materialist  holding that there was no existence and that the self is annihilated upon death  Others believed in a form of cyclic existence  where a being is born  lives  dies and then is reborn  but in the context of a type of determinism or fatalism in which karma played no role  Others were  eternalists   postulating an eternally existent self or soul comparable to that in Judaic monotheism  the ātman survives death and reincarnates as another living being  based on its karmic inheritance  This is the idea that has become dominant  with certain modifications  in modern Hinduism   The Buddhist concept of reincarnation differs from others in that there is no eternal  soul    spirit  or  self  but only a  stream of consciousness  that links life with life  The actual process of change from one life to the next is called punarbhava  Sanskrit  or punabbhava  Pāli   literally  becoming again   or more briefly bhava   becoming   and some English speaking Buddhists prefer the term  rebirth  or  re becoming  to render this term as they take  reincarnation  to imply a fixed entity that is reborn  Popular Jain cosmology and Buddhist cosmology as well as a number of schools of Hinduism posit rebirth in many worlds and in varied forms  In Buddhist tradition the process occurs across five or six realms of existence  including the human  any kind of animal and several types of supernatural being  It is said in Tibetan Buddhism that it is very rare for a person to be reborn in the immediate next life as a human   Gilgul  Gilgul neshamot or Gilgulei Ha Neshamot  Heb  גלגול הנשמות  refers to the concept of reincarnation in Kabbalistic Judaism  found in much Yiddish literature among Ashkenazi Jews  Gilgul means  cycle  and neshamot is  souls   The equivalent Arabic term is tanasukh  the belief is found among Shi a ghulat Muslim sects   2  History  2 1  Origins  The origins of the notion of reincarnation are obscure  Discussion of the subject appears in the philosophical traditions of India  including the Indus Valley   The Greek Pre Socratics discussed reincarnation  and the Celtic Druids are also reported to have taught a doctrine of reincarnation   The ideas associated with reincarnation may have arisen independently in different regions  or they might have spread as a result of cultural contact  Proponents of cultural transmission have looked for links between Iron Age Celtic  Greek and Vedic philosophy and religion  some even suggesting that belief in reincarnation was present in Proto Indo European religion  In ancient European  Iranian and Indian agricultural cultures  the life cycles of birth  death  and rebirth were recognized as a replica of natural agricultural cycles   2 2  Early Jainism  Hinduism and Buddhism  Patrick Olivelle asserts that the origin of the concept of the cycle of birth and death  the concept of samsara  and the concept of liberation in the Indian tradition  were in part the creation of the non Vedic Shramana tradition  Another possibility are the prehistoric Dravidian traditions of South India  Some scholars suggest that the idea is original to the Buddha   In Jainism  the soul and matter are considered eternal  not created and perpetual  There is a constant interplay between the two  resulting in bewildering cosmic manifestations in material  psychic and emotional spheres around us  This led to the theories of transmigration and rebirth  Changes but not total annihilation of spirit and matter is the basic postulate of Jain philosophy  The life as we know now  after death therefore moves on to another form of life based on the merits and demerits it accumulated in its current life  The path to becoming a supreme soul is to practice non violence and be truthful   In Hinduism s Rigveda  the oldest extant Indo Aryan text  numerous references are made to transmigration  rebirth  punarjanma   and redeath  punarmrtyu  in the Brahmanas  One verse reads   Each death repeats the death of the primordial man  purusa   which was also the first sacrifice   RV 10 90   Another excerpt from the Rig Veda states  10  16  1 4    Indian discussion of reincarnation enters the historical record from about the 6th century BCE  with the development of the Advaita Vedanta tradition in the early Upanishads  around the middle of the first millennium BCE   Gautama Buddha  623–543 BCE  as well as Mahavira  the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism   The systematic attempt to attain first hand knowledge of past lives has been developed in various ways in different places  The early Buddhist texts discuss techniques for recalling previous births  predicated on the development of high levels of meditative concentration  The later Yoga Sutras of Patanjali  which incorporated elements of Buddhist thought  give similar instructions on how to attain the ability  The Buddha reportedly warned that this experience can be misleading and should be interpreted with care  Tibetan Buddhism has developed a unique  science  of death and rebirth  a good deal of which is set down in what is popularly known as The Tibetan Book of the Dead   2 3  Early Greece  Early Greek discussion of the concept likewise dates to the 6th century BCE  An early Greek thinker known to have considered rebirth is Pherecydes of Syros  fl  540 BCE   His younger contemporary Pythagoras  c  570–c  495 BCE   its first famous exponent  instituted societies for its diffusion  Plato  428 427–348 347 BCE  presented accounts of reincarnation in his works  particularly the Myth of Er   Authorities have not agreed on how the notion arose in Greece  sometimes Pythagoras is said to have been Pherecydes  pupil  sometimes to have introduced it with the doctrine of Orphism  a Thracian religion that was to be important in the diffusion of reincarnation  or else to have brought the teaching from India  In Phaedo  Plato makes his teacher Socrates  prior to his death  state   I am confident that there truly is such a thing as living again  and that the living spring from the dead   However Xenophon does not mention Socrates as believing in reincarnation and Plato may have systematised Socrates  thought with concepts he took directly from Pythagoreanism or Orphism   2 4  Classical Antiquity  The Orphic religion  which taught reincarnation  first appeared in Thrace in north eastern Greece and Bulgaria  about the 6th century BC  organized itself into mystery schools at Eleusis and elsewhere  and produced a copious literature  Orpheus  its legendary founder  is said to have taught that the immortal soul aspires to freedom while the body holds it prisoner  The wheel of birth revolves  the soul alternates between freedom and captivity round the wide circle of necessity  Orpheus proclaimed the need of the grace of the gods  Dionysus in particular  and of self purification until the soul has completed the spiral ascent of destiny to live for ever   An association between Pythagorean philosophy and reincarnation was routinely accepted throughout antiquity  In the Republic Plato makes Socrates tell how Er  the son of Armenius  miraculously returned to life on the twelfth day after death and recounted the secrets of the other world  There are myths and theories to the same effect in other dialogues  in the Chariot allegory of the Phaedrus  in the Meno  Timaeus and Laws  The soul  once separated from the body  spends an indeterminate amount of time in  formland   see The Allegory of the Cave in The Republic  and then assumes another body   In later Greek literature the doctrine is mentioned in a fragment of Menander and satirized by Lucian  In Roman literature it is found as early as Ennius  who  in a lost passage of his Annals  told how he had seen Homer in a dream  who had assured him that the same soul which had animated both the poets had once belonged to a peacock  Persius in his satires  vi  9  laughs at this  it is referred to also by Lucretius and Horace   Virgil works the idea into his account of the Underworld in the sixth book of the Aeneid  It persists down to the late classic thinkers  Plotinus and the other Neoplatonists  In the Hermetica  a Graeco Egyptian series of writings on cosmology and spirituality attributed to Hermes Trismegistus Thoth  the doctrine of reincarnation is central   In Greco Roman thought  the concept of metempsychosis disappeared with the rise of Early Christianity  reincarnation being incompatible with the Christian core doctrine of salvation of the faithful after death  It has been suggested that some of the early Church Fathers  especially Origen still entertained a belief in the possibility of reincarnation  but evidence is tenuous  and the writings of Origen as they have come down to us speak explicitly against it   Some early Christian Gnostic sects professed reincarnation  The Sethians and followers of Valentinus believed in it  The followers of Bardaisan of Mesopotamia  a sect of the 2nd century deemed heretical by the Catholic Church  drew upon Chaldean astrology  to which Bardaisan s son Harmonius  educated in Athens  added Greek ideas including a sort of metempsychosis  Another such teacher was Basilides  132–  CE AD   known to us through the criticisms of Irenaeus and the work of Clement of Alexandria   see also Neoplatonism and Gnosticism and Buddhism and Gnosticism   In the third Christian century Manichaeism spread both east and west from Babylonia  then within the Sassanid Empire  where its founder Mani lived about 216–276  Manichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 AD  Noting Mani s early travels to the Kushan Empire and other Buddhist influences in Manichaeism  Richard Foltz attributes Mani s teaching of reincarnation to Buddhist influence  However the inter relation of Manicheanism  Orphism  Gnosticism and neo Platonism is far from clear   2 5  The Celts  In the 1st century BC Alexander Cornelius Polyhistor wrote   Julius Caesar recorded that the druids of Gaul  Britain and Ireland had metempsychosis as one of their core doctrines   2 6  Judaism  In Judaism  the Zohar  first publicized in the 13th century  discusses reincarnation at length  especially in the Torah portion  Balak   The most comprehensive kabbalistic work on reincarnation  Shaar HaGilgulim  was written by Rabbi Chaim Vital  based on the teachings of his mentor  the 16th century kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria  who was said to know the past lives of each person through his semi prophetic abilities  The 18th century Lithuanian master scholar and kabbalist  Rabbi Elijah  known as the Vilna Gaon  Elijah of Vilna   authored a commentary on the biblical Book of Jonah as an allegory of reincarnation   According to the Jewish Encyclopedia  the philosophy of metempsychosis entered Judaism during the eighth century  under the influences of Islamic mysticism   There is an extensive literature of Jewish folk and traditional stories that refer to reincarnation   2 7  Taoism  Taoist documents from as early as the Han Dynasty claimed that Lao Tzu appeared on earth as different persons in different times beginning in the legendary era of Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors  The  ca  3rd century BC  Chuang Tzu states   Birth is not a beginning  death is not an end  There is existence without limitation  there is continuity without a starting point  Existence without limitation is Space  Continuity without a starting point is Time  There is birth  there is death  there is issuing forth  there is entering in    2 8  Middle Ages  Around the 11–12th century several reincarnationist movements were persecuted as heresies  through the establishment of the Inquisition in the Latin west  These included the Cathar  Paterene or Albigensian church of western Europe  the Paulician movement  which arose in Armenia  and the Bogomils in Bulgaria   Christian sects such as the Bogomils and the Cathars  who professed reincarnation and other gnostic beliefs  were referred to as  Manichean   and are today sometimes described by scholars as  Neo Manichean   As there is no known Manichaean mythology or terminology in the writings of these groups there has been some dispute among historians as to whether these groups truly were descendants of Manichaeism   2 8 1  Norse mythology  Reincarnation also appears in Norse mythology  in the Poetic Edda  The editor of the Poetic Edda says that Helgi Hjörvarðsson and his mistress  the valkyrie Sváfa  whose love story is told in the poem Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar  were reborn as Helgi Hundingsbane and the valkyrie Sigrún  Helgi and Sigrún s love story is the matter of a part of the Völsunga saga and the lays Helgakviða Hundingsbana I and II  They were reborn a second time as Helgi Haddingjaskati and the valkyrie Kára  but unfortunately their story  Káruljóð  only survives in a probably modified form in the Hrómundar saga Gripssonar   The belief in reincarnation may have been commonplace among the Norse since the annotator of the Poetic Edda wrote that people formerly used to believe in it   2 9  Renaissance and Early Modern period  While reincarnation has been a matter of faith in some communities from an early date it has also frequently been argued for on principle  as Plato does when he argues that the number of souls must be finite because souls are indestructible  Benjamin Franklin held a similar view  Sometimes such convictions  as in Socrates  case  arise from a more general personal faith  at other times from anecdotal evidence such as Plato makes Socrates offer in the Myth of Er   During the Renaissance translations of Plato  the Hermetica and other works fostered new European interest in reincarnation  Marsilio Ficino argued that Plato s references to reincarnation were intended allegorically  Shakespeare made fun but Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake by authorities after being found guilty of heresy by the Roman Inquisition for his teachings  But the Greek philosophical works remained available and  particularly in north Europe  were discussed by groups such as the Cambridge Platonists   2 10  19th to 20th centuries  By the 19th century the philosophers Schopenhauer and Nietzsche could access the Indian scriptures for discussion of the doctrine of reincarnation  which recommended itself to the American Transcendentalists Henry David Thoreau  Walt Whitman and Ralph Waldo Emerson and was adapted by Francis Bowen into Christian Metempsychosis   By the early 20th century  interest in reincarnation had been introduced into the nascent discipline of psychology  largely due to the influence of William James  who raised aspects of the philosophy of mind  comparative religion  the psychology of religious experience and the nature of empiricism  James was influential in the founding of the American Society for Psychical Research  ASPR  in New York City in 1885  three years after the British Society for Psychical Research  SPR  was inaugurated in London  leading to systematic  critical investigation of paranormal phenomena   At this time popular awareness of the idea of reincarnation was boosted by the Theosophical Society s dissemination of systematised and universalised Indian concepts and also by the influence of magical societies like The Golden Dawn  Notable personalities like Annie Besant  W  B  Yeats and Dion Fortune made the subject almost as familiar an element of the popular culture of the west as of the east  By 1924 the subject could be satirised in popular children s books   Théodore Flournoy was among the first to study a claim of past life recall in the course of his investigation of the medium Hélène Smith  published in 1900  in which he defined the possibility of cryptomnesia in such accounts  Carl Gustav Jung  like Flournoy based in Switzerland  also emulated him in his thesis based on a study of cryptomnesia in psychism  Later Jung would emphasise the importance of the persistence of memory and ego in psychological study of reincarnation   This concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personality     that  one is able  at least potentially  to remember that one has lived through previous existences  and that these existences were one s own      Hypnosis  used in psychoanalysis for retrieving forgotten memories  was eventually tried as a means of studying the phenomenon of past life recall   3  Reincarnation research  Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson  from the University of Virginia  investigated many reports of young children who claimed to remember a past life  He conducted more than 2 500 case studies over a period of 40 years and published twelve books  including Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation and Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect  Stevenson methodically documented each child s statements and then identified the deceased person the child identified with  and verified the facts of the deceased person s life that matched the child s memory  He also matched birthmarks and birth defects to wounds and scars on the deceased  verified by medical records such as autopsy photographs  in Reincarnation and Biology   Stevenson searched for disconfirming evidence and alternative explanations for the reports  and believed that his strict methods ruled out all possible  normal  explanations for the child’s memories  However  a significant majority of Stevenson s reported cases of reincarnation originated in Eastern societies  where dominant religions often permit the concept of reincarnation  Following this type of criticism  Stevenson published a book on European Cases of the Reincarnation Type  Other people who have undertaken reincarnation research include Jim B  Tucker  Antonia Mills  Satwant Pasricha  Godwin Samararatne  and Erlendur Haraldsson   Skeptics such as Paul Edwards have analyzed many of these accounts  and called them anecdotal  while also suggesting that claims of evidence for reincarnation originate from selective thinking and from the false memories that often result from one s own belief system and basic fears  and thus cannot be counted as empirical evidence  Carl Sagan referred to examples apparently from Stevenson s investigations in his book The Demon Haunted World as an example of carefully collected empirical data  though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories   Stevenson claimed there were a handful of cases that suggested evidence of xenoglossy  These included two where a subject under hypnosis could allegedly converse with people speaking the foreign language  instead of merely being able to recite foreign words  Sarah Thomason  a linguist at the University of Michigan  reanalyzed these cases  concluding that  the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy    Ian Wilson argued that a large number of Stevenson’s cases consisted of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a higher caste  He speculated that such cases may represent a scheme to obtain money from the family of the alleged former incarnation  The philosopher Keith Augustine has written  the vast majority of Stevenson s cases come from countries where a religious belief in reincarnation is strong  and rarely elsewhere  seems to indicate that cultural conditioning  rather than reincarnation  generates claims of spontaneous past life memories   According to the research of Robert Baker many of the alleged past life experiences investigated by Stevenson and other parapsychologists can be explained in terms of known psychological factors  Baker has written the recalling of past lives is a mixture of cryptomnesia and confabulation  The philosopher Paul Edwards noted that reincarnation invokes assumptions and is inconsistent with modern science   Objections to claims of reincarnation include the facts that the vast majority of people do not remember previous lives and there is no mechanism known to modern science that would enable a personality to survive death and travel to another body  barring the idea of biocentrism  Researchers such as Stevenson have acknowledged these limitations   4  Reincarnation in the West  During recent decades  many people in the West have developed an interest in reincarnation  Feature films  such as The Reincarnation of Peter Proud  Dead Again  Kundun  Fluke  What Dreams May Come  The Mummy and Birth  and Chances Are  contemporary books by authors such as Carol Bowman and Vicki Mackenzie  as well as popular songs  deal with reincarnation   Recent studies have indicated that some Westerners accept the idea of reincarnation including certain contemporary Christians  modern Neopagans  followers of Spiritism  Theosophists and students of esoteric philosophies such as Kabbalah  and Gnostic and Esoteric Christianity as well as of Indian religions  Demographic survey data from 1999–2002 shows a significant minority of people from Europe and America  where there is reasonable freedom of thought and access to ideas but no outstanding recent reincarnationist tradition  believe we had a life before we were born  will survive death and be born again physically  The mean for the Nordic countries is 22%  The belief in reincarnation is particularly high in the Baltic countries  with Lithuania having the highest figure for the whole of Europe  44%  The lowest figure is in East Germany  12%  In Russia  about one third believes in reincarnation  The effect of communist anti religious ideas on the beliefs of the populations of Eastern Europe seems to have been rather slight  if any  except apparently in East Germany  Overall  22% of respondents in Western Europe believe in reincarnation  According to a 2005 Gallup poll 20 percent of U S  adults believe in reincarnation  Recent surveys by the Barna Group  a Christian research nonprofit organization  have found that a quarter of U S  Christians  including 10 percent of all born again Christians  embrace the idea   Skeptic Carl Sagan asked the Dalai Lama what he would do if a fundamental tenet of his religion  reincarnation  were definitively disproved by science  The Dalai Lama answered   If science can disprove reincarnation  Tibetan Buddhism would abandon reincarnation    but it s going to be mighty hard to disprove reincarnation    Ian Stevenson reported that belief in reincarnation is held  with variations in details  by adherents of almost all major religions except Christianity and Islam  In addition  between 20 and 30 percent of persons in western countries who may be nominal Christians also believe in reincarnation   One 1999 study by Walter and Waterhouse reviewed the previous data on the level of reincarnation belief and performed a set of thirty in depth interviews in Britain among people who did not belong to a religion advocating reincarnation  The authors reported that surveys have found about one fifth to one quarter of Europeans have some level of belief in reincarnation  with similar results found in the USA  In the interviewed group  the belief in the existence of this phenomenon appeared independent of their age  or the type of religion that these people belonged to  with most being Christians  The beliefs of this group also did not appear to contain any more than usual of  new age  ideas  broadly defined  and the authors interpreted their ideas on reincarnation as  one way of tackling issues of suffering   but noted that this seemed to have little effect on their private lives   Waterhouse also published a detailed discussion of beliefs expressed in the interviews  She noted that although most people  hold their belief in reincarnation quite lightly  and were unclear on the details of their ideas  personal experiences such as past life memories and near death experiences had influenced most believers  although only a few had direct experience of these phenomena  Waterhouse analyzed the influences of second hand accounts of reincarnation  writing that most of the people in the survey had heard other people s accounts of past lives from regression hypnosis and dreams and found these fascinating  feeling that there  must be something in it  if other people were having such experiences   5  Contemporary religious philosophies  5 1  Hinduism  Reincarnation – known as Punarjanma – it is one of the core beliefs of Hinduism that is generally accepted by many of its practitioners   Reincarnation is the natural process of birth  death and rebirth  Hindus believe that the Jiva or Atman  soul  is intrinsically pure  However  because of the layers of I ness and My ness  the jiva goes through transmigration in the cycle of births and deaths  Death destroys the physical body  but not the jiva  The jiva is eternal  It takes on another body with respect to its karmas  Every karma produces a result which must be experienced either in this or some future life  As long as the jiva is enveloped in ignorance  it remains attached to material desires and subject to the cycles of births and deaths  Samsara    There is no permanent heaven or hell in Hinduism  After services in the afterlife  the jiva enters the karma and rebirth system  reborn as an animal  a human or a divinity  This reincarnation continues until mokṣa  the final release  is gained   The Bhagavad Gita states   and   According to the Hindu sage Adi Shankaracharya  the world – as we ordinarily understand it – is like a dream  fleeting and illusory  To be trapped in samsara  the cycle of birth and death  is a result of ignorance of the true nature of our existence  It is ignorance  avidya  of one s true self that leads to ego consciousness  grounding one in desire and a perpetual chain of reincarnation  The idea is intricately linked to action  karma   a concept first recorded in the Upanishads  Every action has a reaction and the force determines one s next incarnation  One is reborn through desire  a person desires to be born because he or she wants to enjoy a body  which can never bring deep  lasting happiness or peace  ānanda   After many births every person becomes dissatisfied and begins to seek higher forms of happiness through spiritual experience  When  after spiritual practice  sādhanā   a person realizes that the true  self  is the immortal soul rather than the body or the ego all desires for the pleasures of the world will vanish since they will seem insipid compared to spiritual ānanda  When all desire has vanished the person will not be born again  When the cycle of rebirth thus comes to an end  a person is said to have attained liberation  moksha   All schools agree this implies the cessation of worldly desires and freedom from the cycle of birth and death  though the exact definition differs  Followers of the Advaita Vedanta school believe they will spend eternity absorbed in the perfect peace and happiness of the realization that all existence is One Brahman of which the soul is part  Dvaita schools perform worship with the goal of spending eternity in a spiritual world or heaven  loka  in the blessed company of the Supreme Being   5 1 1  Reasons for Reincarnation  Hindus provide several reasons why the jiva takes on various physical bodies   To experience the fruits of one s karmas  This is the main reason for rebirth  Sattvika  good or righteous  karmas reward one with the pleasures of Svarga  Rajas  pleasure seeking  karmas reward one with mrutyuloka  mortal realm or earth   And Tamas karmas  actions related to inertia  laziness and evil  condemn one to patala loka   To satisfy one s desires  When a person indulges in material pleasures  he or she subsequently develops a stronger desire to enjoy more of it  Vāsanā   This unending craving to satisfy one s desires causes the jiva to assume new physical bodies   To complete one s unfinished sadhana  When an aspirant making spiritual efforts for liberation from maya dies without attaining his or her goal  the jiva gets as a natural cause effect another human body to complete its sadhana   To fulfil a debt  When a jiva is indebted to another jiva  it gets a human birth to fulfil its debt and receive what is owed to it  The jiva comes in the form of a relative  friend or an enemy   To undergo sufferings because of a great soul s curse  A person s grave error or sin may incur the wrath or displeasure of God or a Rishi  This results in the jiva of that person getting another birth  not necessarily into a human body   To attain moksha  By the grace and compassion of God or a God realized guru  a jiva gets a human body to purge itself of the layers of base instincts   5 2  Jainism  Jainism is historically connected with the sramana tradition with which the earliest mentions of reincarnation are associated   Karma forms a central and fundamental part of Jain faith  being intricately connected to other of its philosophical concepts like transmigration  reincarnation  liberation  non violence  ahiṃsā  and non attachment  among others  Actions are seen to have consequences  some immediate  some delayed  even into future incarnations  So the doctrine of karma is not considered simply in relation to one life time  but also in relation to both future incarnations and past lives  Uttarādhyayana sūtra 3 3–4 states   The jīva or the soul is sometimes born in the world of gods  sometimes in hell  Sometimes it acquires the body of a demon  all this happens on account of its karma  This jīva sometimes takes birth as a worm  as an insect or as an ant   The text further states  32 7    Karma is the root of birth and death  The souls bound by karma go round and round in the cycle of existence    Actions and emotions in the current lifetime affect future incarnations depending on the nature of the particular karma  For example  a good and virtuous life indicates a latent desire to experience good and virtuous themes of life  Therefore  such a person attracts karma that ensures that his future births will allow him to experience and manifest his virtues and good feelings unhindered  In this case  he may take birth in heaven or in a prosperous and virtuous human family  On the other hand  a person who has indulged in immoral deeds  or with a cruel disposition  indicates a latent desire to experience cruel themes of life  As a natural consequence  he will attract karma which will ensure that he is reincarnated in hell  or in lower life forms  to enable his soul to experience the cruel themes of life   There is no retribution  judgment or reward involved but a natural consequences of the choices in life made either knowingly or unknowingly  Hence  whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing in its present life is on account of choices that it has made in the past  As a result of this doctrine  Jainism attributes supreme importance to pure thinking and moral behavior   The Jain texts postulate four gatis  that is states of existence or birth categories  within which the soul transmigrates  The four gatis are  deva  demi gods   manuṣya  humans   nāraki  hell beings  and tiryañca  animals  plants and micro organisms   The four gatis have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered Jain universe  demi gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated  humans  plants and animals occupy the middle levels  and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated   Single sensed souls  however  called nigoda  and element bodied souls pervade all tiers of this universe  Nigodas are souls at the bottom end of the existential hierarchy  They are so tiny and undifferentiated  that they lack even individual bodies  living in colonies  According to Jain texts  this infinity of nigodas can also be found in plant tissues  root vegetables and animal bodies  Depending on its karma  a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies  The four main destinies are further divided into sub categories and still smaller sub sub categories  In all  Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8 4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within samsara   In Jainism  God has no role to play in an individual s destiny  one s personal destiny is not seen as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment  but rather as a result of its own personal karma  A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon  Bhagvati sūtra 8 9 9  links specific states of existence to specific karmas  Violent deeds  killing of creatures having five sense organs  eating fish  and so on  lead to rebirth in hell  Deception  fraud and falsehood lead to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world  Kindness  compassion and humble character result in human birth  while austerities and the making and keeping of vows lead to rebirth in heaven   Each soul is thus responsible for its own predicament  as well as its own salvation  Accumulated karma represent a sum total of all unfulfilled desires  attachments and aspirations of a soul  It enables the soul to experience the various themes of the lives that it desires to experience  Hence a soul may transmigrate from one life form to another for countless of years  taking with it the karma that it has earned  until it finds conditions that bring about the required fruits  In certain philosophies  heavens and hells are often viewed as places for eternal salvation or eternal damnation for good and bad deeds  But according to Jainism  such places  including the earth are simply the places which allow the soul to experience its unfulfilled karma   5 3  Buddhism  The early Buddhist texts make it clear that there is no permanent consciousness that moves from life to life  Gautama Buddha taught a distinct concept of rebirth constrained by the concepts of anattā  that there is no irreducible ātman or  self  tying these lives together  which serves as a contrast to Hinduism  where everything is connected  and in a sense   everything is everything    and anicca  that all compounded things are subject to dissolution  including all the components of the human person and personality   In Buddhist doctrine the evolving consciousness  Pali  samvattanika viññana  or stream of consciousness  Pali  viññana sotam  Sanskrit  vijñāna srotām  vijñāna santāna  or citta santāna  upon death  or  the dissolution of the aggregates   P  khandhas  S  skandhas    becomes one of the contributing causes for the arising of a new aggregation  At the death of one personality  a new one comes into being  much as the flame of a dying candle can serve to light the flame of another  The consciousness in the new person is neither identical to nor entirely different from that in the deceased but the two form a causal continuum or stream  Transmigration is the effect of karma  kamma  or volitional action  The basic cause is the abiding of consciousness in ignorance  Pali  avijja  Sanskrit  avidya   when ignorance is uprooted  rebirth ceases   The Buddha s detailed conception of the connections between action  karma   rebirth and causality is set out in the twelve links of dependent origination  The empirical  changing self does not only affect the world about it  it also generates  consciously and unconsciously  a subjective image of the world in which it lives as  reality   It  tunes in  to a particular level of consciousness which has a particular range of objects  selectively notices such objects and forms a partial model of reality in which the ego is the crucial reference point  Vipassana meditation uses  bare attention  to mind states without interfering  owning or judging  Observation reveals each moment as an experience of an individual mind state such as a thought  a memory  a feeling or a perception that arises  exists and ceases  This limits the power of desire  which  according to the second noble truth of Buddhism  is the cause of suffering  dukkha   and leads to Nirvana  nibbana  vanishing  of the self idea   in which self oriented models are transcended and  the world stops   Thus consciousness is a continuous birth and death of mind states  rebirth is the persistence of this process   Buddhist traditions vary in precise views on rebirth  The Tibetan schools hold to the notion of a bardo  intermediate state  that can last up to forty nine days  An accomplished or realized practitioner  by maintaining conscious awareness during the death process  can choose to return to samsara  They believe many lamas choose to be born again and again as humans and are called tulkus or incarnate lamas  The Sarvastivada school believed that between death and rebirth there is a sort of limbo in which beings do not yet reap the consequences of their previous actions but may still influence their rebirth  The death process and this intermediate state were believed to offer a uniquely favourable opportunity for spiritual awakening  Theravada Buddhism generally denies there is an intermediate state—though some early Buddhist texts seem to support the idea   but asserts that rebirth is immediate   Within Japanese Zen  reincarnation is accepted by some  but wholly rejected by others  A distinction can be drawn between  folk Zen   as in the Zen practiced by devotional lay people  and  philosophical Zen   Folk Zen generally accepts the various supernatural elements of Buddhism such as rebirth  Philosophical Zen  however  places such emphasis on the present moment that rebirth may be considered irrelevant because  even if it does exist  it can never be consciously experienced  Specifically  in Zen the past and future are considered to be merely ideas which are held in the present  Because as living beings rebirth can only be viewed as something which may have happened in the past or that might happen in the future  we must essentially reject the present moment  or Dharma  in order to even consider it  For this reason  rebirth is often either rejected or considered unknowable in Zen and therefore a distraction  Dōgen Zenji  the founder of Japanese Sōtō Zen  writes the following regarding reincarnation   Some schools conclude that karma continues to exist and adhere to the person until it works out its consequences  For the Sautrantika school  each act  perfumes  the individual or  plants a seed  that later germinates  Tibetan Buddhism stresses the state of mind at the time of death  To die with a peaceful mind will stimulate a virtuous seed and a fortunate rebirth  a disturbed mind will stimulate a non virtuous seed and an unfortunate rebirth  The medieval Pali scholar Buddhaghosa labeled the consciousness that constitutes the condition for a new birth as described in the early texts  rebirth linking consciousness   patisandhi    Still other Buddhists regard samsara as merely a metaphor of the human condition   5 4  Sant mystics and Sikhism  Reincarnation remained a tenet of the Sant Bhakti movement and of related mystics on the frontiers of Islam and Hinduism such as the Baul minstrels  the Kabir panth and the Sikh Panth  Sikhs believe the soul is passed from one body to another until Liberation  If we perform good deeds and actions and remember the Creator  we attain a better life while  if we carry out evil actions and sinful deeds  we will be incarnated in “lower” life forms  God may pardon wrongs and release us  Otherwise reincarnation is due to the law of cause and effect but does not create any caste or differences among people  Some scholars consider Eckankar a Western presentation of Sant mysticism  It teaches that Soul is eternal and either chooses an incarnation for growth or else an incarnation is imposed or agreed to because of Karma  Soul is perfected through a series of incarnations until it arrives at a level of spiritual development that obviates the need for further experience in what are described as the  lower worlds  of experience in time and space   5 5  African Vodun  The Yoruba believe in reincarnation within the family  The names Babatunde  Father returns   Yetunde  Mother returns   Babatunji  Father wakes once again  and Sotunde  The wise man returns  all offer vivid evidence of the Ifa concept of familial or lineal rebirth  There is no simple guarantee that your grandfather or great uncle will  come back  in the birth of your child  however   Whenever the time arrives for a spirit to return to Earth  otherwise known as The Marketplace  through the conception of a new life in the direct bloodline of the family  one of the component entities of a person s being returns  while the other remains in Heaven  Ikole Orun   The spirit that returns does so in the form of a Guardian Ori  One s Guardian Ori  which is represented and contained in the crown of the head  represents not only the spirit and energy of one s previous blood relative  but the accumulated wisdom he or she has acquired through a myriad of lifetimes  This is not to be confused with one’s spiritual Ori  which contains personal destiny  but instead refers to the coming back to The Marketplace of one s personal blood Ori through one s new life and experiences   5 6  Islam  The idea of reincarnation is accepted by a few Muslim sects  particularly of the Ghulat  and by other sects in the Muslim world such as Druzes  Historically  South Asian Isma ilis performed chantas yearly  one of which is for seeking forgiveness of sins committed in past lives  Alawites belonging to Shia denomination of Islam hold that they were originally stars or divine lights that were cast out of heaven through disobedience and must undergo repeated reincarnation  or metempsychosis  before returning to heaven  They can be reincarnated as Christians or others through sin and as animals if they become infidels   Reincarnation was also accepted by some streams of Sufism  Modern Sufis who embrace the idea include Bawa Muhaiyadeen  However Hazrat Inayat Khan has criticized the idea as unhelpful to the spiritual seeker   5 7  Judaism  Reincarnation is one of the thirteen principles of Maimonides 13 Principles of Faith  number 13  which states  I believe with a perfect faith that the Holy One    in the future will bring the dead back to life      It is also a core element in the tale of the Ten Martyrs in the Yom Kippur liturgy  who were killed by Romans to atone for the souls of the ten brothers of Joseph  is read in Ashkenazi Orthodox Jewish communities  However it is not a topic widely discussed in the classical rabbinical works  Mishnah and Talmud   or Maimonides   Medieval Jewish Rationalist philosophers discussed the issue  often in rejection  However  Jewish mystical texts  the Kabbalah   from their classic Medieval canon onwards  teach a belief in Gilgul Neshamot  Hebrew for metempsychosis of souls  literally  soul cycle   plural  gilgulim    It is a common belief in contemporary Hasidic Judaism  which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative  though unstressed in favour of a more innate psychological mysticism  Kabbalah also teaches that  The soul of Moses is reincarnated in every generation   Other  Non Hasidic  Orthodox Jewish groups while not placing a heavy emphasis on reincarnation  do acknowledge it as a valid teaching  Its popularisation entered modern secular Yiddish literature and folk motif   The 16th century mystical renaissance in communal Safed replaced scholastic Rationalism as mainstream traditional Jewish theology  both in scholarly circles and in the popular imagination  References to gilgul in former Kabbalah became systemised as part of the metaphysical purpose of creation  Isaac Luria  the Ari  brought the issue to the centre of his new mystical articulation  for the first time  and advocated identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures that were compiled by Haim Vital in his Shaar HaGilgulim  Gilgul is contrasted with the other processes in Kabbalah of Ibbur   pregnancy    the attachment of a second soul to an individual for  or by  good means  and Dybuk   possession    the attachment of a spirit  demon  etc  to an individual for  or by   bad  means   In Lurianic Kabbalah  reincarnation is not retributive or fatalistic  but an expression of Divine compassion  the microcosm of the doctrine of cosmic rectification of creation  Gilgul is a heavenly agreement with the individual soul  conditional upon circumstances  Luria s radical system focused on rectification of the Divine soul  played out through Creation  The true essence of anything is the divine spark within that gives it existence  Even a stone or leaf possesses such a soul that  came into this world to receive a rectification   A human soul may occasionally be exiled into lower inanimate  vegetative or animal creations  The most basic component of the soul  the nefesh  must leave at the cessation of blood production  There are four other soul components and different nations of the world possess different forms of souls with different purposes  Each Jewish soul is reincarnated in order to fulfil each of the 613 Mosaic commandments that elevate a particular spark of holiness associated with each commandment  Once all the Sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source  the Messianic Era begins  Non Jewish observance of the 7 Laws of Noah assists the Jewish people  though Biblical adversaries of Israel reincarnate to oppose   Among the many rabbis who accepted reincarnation are Nahmanides  the Ramban  and Rabbenu Bahya ben Asher  Levi ibn Habib  the Ralbah   Shelomoh Alkabez  Moses Cordovero  Moses Chaim Luzzatto  the Baal Shem Tov and later Hasidic masters  DovBer Pinson and the Mitnagdic Vilna Gaon and Chaim Volozhin and their school  Ben Ish Chai of Baghdad and the Baba Sali  Rabbis who have rejected the idea include Saadia Gaon  David Kimhi  Hasdai Crescas  Joseph Albo  Abraham ibn Daud  Leon de Modena  Solomon ben Aderet  Maimonides and Asher ben Jehiel  Among the Geonim  Hai Gaon argued in favour of gilgulim   5 8  Native American nations  Reincarnation is an intrinsic part of many Native American and Inuit traditions  In the now heavily Christian Polar North  now mainly parts of Greenland and Nunavut   the concept of reincarnation is enshrined in the Inuit language   The following is a story of human to human reincarnation as told by Thunder Cloud  a Winnebago  Ho Chunk tribe  shaman referred to as T  C  in the narrative  Here T  C  talks about his two previous lives and how he died and came back again to this his third lifetime  He describes his time between lives  when he was “blessed” by Earth Maker and all the abiding spirits and given special powers  including the ability to heal the sick   T  C ’s Account of His Two Reincarnations   5 9  Christianity  Though the major Christian denominations reject the concept of reincarnation  a large number of Christians profess the belief  In a survey by the Pew Forum in 2009  24% of American Christians expressed a belief in reincarnation  In a 1981 Survey in Europe 31% of regular churchgoing Catholics expressed a belief in reincarnation   Geddes MacGregor  an Episcopalian priest and professor of Philosophy  makes a case for the compatibility of Christian doctrine and reincarnation   There is evidence that the writing of Origen  a Church father in early Christian times  was mistranslated into Latin due to religious bias and that he taught reincarnation in his lifetime  One of the epistles written by St  Jerome   To Avitus   Letter 124   Ad Avitum  Epistula CXXIV   asserts that Origen s On First Principles  Latin  De Principiis  Greek  Περὶ Ἀρχῶν  was mistranscribed from Greek into Latin   Under the impression that Origen was a heretic like Arius  St  Jerome criticizes ideas described in On First Principles  Further in  To Avitus   Letter 124   St  Jerome writes about  convincing proof  that Origen teaches reincarnation in the original version of the book   The original text of On First Principles has almost completely disappeared  It remains extant as De Principiis in fragments faithfully translated into Latin by St  Jerome and in  the not very reliable Latin translation of Rufinus    5 10  New religious and spiritual movements  5 10 1  Theosophy  The Theosophical Society draws much of its inspiration from India  The idea is  according to a recent Theosophical writer   the master key to modern problems   including heredity  In the Theosophical world view reincarnation is the vast rhythmic process by which the soul  the part of a person which belongs to the formless non material and timeless worlds  unfolds its spiritual powers in the world and comes to know itself  It descends from sublime  free  spiritual realms and gathers experience through its effort to express itself in the world  Afterwards there is a withdrawal from the physical plane to successively higher levels of reality  in death  a purification and assimilation of the past life  Having cast off all instruments of personal experience it stands again in its spiritual and formless nature  ready to begin its next rhythmic manifestation  every lifetime bringing it closer to complete self knowledge and self expression  However it may attract old mental  emotional  and energetic karma patterns to form the new personality   5 10 2  Modern Astrology  Inspired by Helena Blavatsky s major works  including Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine  astrologers in the early twentieth century integrated the concepts of karma and reincarnation into the practice of Western astrology  Notable astrologers who advanced this development included Alan Leo  Charles E  O  Carter  Marc Edmund Jones  and Dane Rudhyar  A new synthesis of East and West resulted as Hindu and Buddhist concepts of reincarnation were fused with Western astrology s deep roots in Hermeticism and Neoplatonism  In the case of Rudhyar  this synthesis was enhanced with the addition of Jungian depth psychology  This dynamic integration of astrology  reincarnation and depth psychology has continued into the modern era with the work of astrologers Steven Forrest and Jeffrey Wolf Green  Their respective schools of Evolutionary Astrology are based on  an acceptance of the fact that human beings incarnate in a succession of lifetimes    5 10 3  Anthroposophy  Anthroposophy describes reincarnation from the point of view of Western philosophy and culture  The ego is believed to transmute transient soul experiences into universals that form the basis for an individuality that can endure after death  These universals include ideas  which are intersubjective and thus transcend the purely personal  spiritual consciousness   intentionally formed human character  spiritual life   and becoming a fully conscious human being  spiritual humanity   Rudolf Steiner described both the general principles he believed to be operative in reincarnation  such as that one s will activity in one life forms the basis for the thinking of the next  and a number of successive lives of various individualities   5 10 4  Eckankar  Awareness of past lives  dreams  and soul travel are spiritual disciplines practiced by students of Eckankar  Eckankar teaches that each person is Soul  which transcends time and space  Soul travel is a term specific to Eckankar that refers to a shift in consciousness  Eckists believe the purpose of being aware of past lives is to help with understanding personal conditions in the present  Practicing students of Eckankar can become aware of past lives  through dreams  soul travel  and spiritual exercises called contemplations  This form of contemplation is the active  unconditional practice of going within to connect with the  Light and Sound of God  known as the divine life current or Holy Spirit   5 10 5  Scientology  Past reincarnation  usually termed  past lives   is a key part of the principles and practices of the Church of Scientology  Scientologists believe that the human individual is actually a thetan  an immortal spiritual entity  that has fallen into a degraded state as a result of past life experiences  Scientology auditing is intended to free the person of these past life traumas and recover past life memory  leading to a higher state of spiritual awareness  This idea is echoed in their highest fraternal religious order  the Sea Organization  whose motto is  Revenimus  or  We Come Back   and whose members sign a  billion year contract  as a sign of commitment to that ideal  L  Ron Hubbard  the founder of Scientology  does not use the word  reincarnation  to describe its beliefs  noting that   The common definition of reincarnation has been altered from its original meaning  The word has come to mean  to be born again in different life forms  whereas its actual definition is  to be born again into the flesh of another body   Scientology ascribes to this latter  original definition of reincarnation    The first writings in Scientology regarding past lives date from around 1951 and slightly earlier  In 1960  Hubbard published a book on past lives entitled Have You Lived Before This Life  In 1968 he wrote Mission into Time  a report on a five week sailing expedition to Sardinia  Sicily and Carthage to see if specific evidence could be found to substantiate L  Ron Hubbard s recall of incidents in his own past  centuries ago   5 10 6  Meher Baba  The Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba stated that reincarnation occurs due to desires and once those desires are extinguished the ego mind ceases to reincarnate   5 10 7  Spiritism  Spiritism is a Christian religion codified in the 19th century by the French educator Allan Kardec  Spiritism soon spread to other countries  having today 35 countries represented in the International Spiritist Council  In countries like Brazil the movement had spread and became widely accepted  mostly due to Chico Xavier s works  Today the official spiritist community has about 20 million adepts  though due to local syncretism  it is accepted and somehow practiced by three times as many across the country  Some statistics even mention an adherence to Spiritist practices by 40 million people in Brazil   Spiritism teaches reincarnation or rebirth into human life after death  This basically distinguishes Spiritism from Spiritualism  According to the Spiritist doctrine  reincarnation explains the moral and intellectual differences among men  It also provides the path to man s moral and intellectual perfection by amending for his mistakes and increasing his knowledge in successive lives  For this reason Spiritism does not accept rebirth in animals as this would be retrogressive  Reincarnation is the natural method of the perfection process through which the Spirit faces countless different situations  problems and obstacles  and needs to learn how to deal with them  The central tenet of Spiritist doctrine is the belief in spiritual life  The spirit is eternal  and evolves through a series of incarnations in the material world  The true life is the spiritual one  life in the material world is just a short termed stage  where the spirit has the opportunity to learn and develop its potentials  Reincarnation is the process where the spirit  once free in the spiritual world  comes back to the world for further learning   6  In popular culture  Reincarnation has been the theme of   including Madhumati  1958   which was one of the earliest Bollywood films of the theme  The 2010 Thai film  Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives  won the Palme d Or at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival  The John Craigie song  So Many Lives  has been called a  reincarnation love song  and features a character that goes from being a caterpillar  to a bumble bee  to a sperm whale  to a chimpanzee   7  See also  Afterlife  Arthur Guirdham  Bhavacakra  Arthur Flowerdew  Joan Grant  Karmic
