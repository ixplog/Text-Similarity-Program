A pianist       is an individual who plays the piano  Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano  Consequently  pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from  including traditionally classical music  jazz  blues and all sorts of popular music  including rock music  Most pianists also can  to a certain extent  play other keyboard related instruments such as the synthesizer  harpsichord  celesta  the organ  etc   1  Pianists past and present  Modern classical pianists dedicate their careers to performing  recording  teaching  researching as well as learning new works expanding their repertoire  They generally do not write or transcribe music as pianists did in the 19th century  Some classical pianists might specialize in accompaniment and chamber music while others  relatively few  will perform as full time piano soloists   2  Classical  Mozart could be considered the first  concert pianist  as he performed widely on the piano  Composers Beethoven and Clementi from the classical era were also famed for their playing  as were  from the romantic era  Liszt  Brahms  Chopin  Mendelssohn and Rachmaninoff  From that era  leading performers less known as composers were Clara Schumann and Hans von Bûlow  However  as we do not have modern audio recordings of most of these pianists  we rely mainly on written commentary to give us an account of their technique and style   3  Jazz  Jazz pianists almost always perform with other musicians  Their playing is freer than that of classical pianists and they create an air of spontaneity in their performances  They generally do not write down their compositions  improvisation is a significant part of their work  Well known Jazz pianists include Art Tatum  Duke Ellington  Thelonious Monk  Oscar Peterson and Herbie Hancock   Popular pianists might work as live performers  concert  theatre  etc    session musicians  arrangers most likely feel at home with synthesizers and other electornic keyboard instruments  Notable popular pianists include Victor Borge who performed as a comedian  Richard Clayderman  who is known for his covers of popular tunes  and singer and entertainer Liberace  who at the height of his fame  was one of the highest paid entertainers in the world   A single listing of pianists in all genres would be impractical  given the multitude of musicians noted for their performances on the instrument  Below are links to lists of well known or influential pianists divided by genres   3 1  Classical pianists  List of classical pianists  recorded   List of classical pianists  List of classical piano duos  performers   3 2  Jazz pianists  List of jazz pianists  3 3  Pop and rock music pianists  List of pop and rock pianists  3 4  Blues pianists  List of blues musicians  List of boogie woogie musicians  3 5  Gospel pianists  List of gospel musicians  3 6  New age pianists  List of new age music artists  4  Pianist composers  Many important composers were also virtuoso pianists  The following is an incomplete list of such musicians   4 1  Classical period  Ludwig van Beethoven  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart  Johann Nepomuk Hummel  Muzio Clementi  Carl Maria von Weber  Malek Jandali  4 2  Romantic period  Edvard Grieg  Ferenc Liszt  Frédéric Chopin  Felix Mendelssohn  Johannes Brahms  Sergei Rachmaninoff  Anton Rubinstein  Camille Saint Saëns  Isaac Albéniz  Nikolai Medtner  Charles Valentin Alkan  Anton Arensky  Dmitri Shostakovich  4 3  Modern period  Sergei Prokofiev  Béla Bartók Maria Andriasova Esparza  5  References  id Piano
