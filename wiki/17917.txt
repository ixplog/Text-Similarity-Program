Lars von Trier    born Lars Trier  30 April 1956  is a Danish film director and screenwriter  He is closely associated with the Dogme 95 collective – an avant garde filmmaking movement – although his own films have taken a variety of approaches  Known as a provocateur  his work has frequently divided critical opinion  Nevertheless  von Trier is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished and influential directors in world cinema   Von Trier began making films at age eleven  Von Trier suffers periodically from depression  as well as various fears and phobias  including an intense fear of flying  As he quipped in an interview   basically  I m afraid of everything in life  except filmmaking   His first publicly released film was the 1977 experimental short The Orchid Gardener and his first feature came seven years later with The Element of Crime  1984   Among many prizes  awards and nominations  he is the recipient of the Palme d Or  for Dancer in the Dark   the Grand Prix  and the Prix du Jury at the Cannes Film Festival   1  Early life and career  Lars Trier was born in Kongens Lyngby  north of Copenhagen  the son of Inger Trier  née Høst  1915—89   He had believed that his biological father was Ulf Trier  1907—78   until his mother revealed to him on her deathbed that he had been conceived as a result of an affair she had with her employer  Fritz Michael Hartmann  His mother considered herself a Communist  while his father was a Social Democrat  and both were committed nudists  and the young Lars went on several childhood holidays to nudist camps  They regarded the disciplining of children as reactionary  Trier has noted that he was brought up in an atheist family  and that although Ulf Trier was Jewish  he was not religious  His parents did not allow much room in their household for  feelings  religion  or enjoyment   and also refused to make any rules for their children  with complex effects upon von Trier s personality and development  He began making his own films at the age of eleven after receiving a Super 8 camera as a gift  and he continued his independent moviemaking throughout high school   In 1979  he enrolled in the National Film School of Denmark  His peers at the film school nicknamed him  von Trier   The name is sort of an inside joke with the von  German  of  or  from  used as a nobiliary particle   suggesting nobility and a certain arrogance  while Lars is a very common and Trier not an unusual name in Denmark  He reportedly kept the  von  name in homage to Erich von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg  both of whom also added it later in life  During his time as a student at the school he made the films Nocturne and The Last Detail  both of which won Best Film awards at the Munich International Festival of Film Schools  In 1983 he graduated with the 57 minute Images of Liberation  which became the first Danish school film to receive a regular theatrical release   2  Europe trilogy  After graduation he began work on the very stylised drama The Element of Crime  Forbrydelsens element 1984   which won the Technical Grand Prize at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival   His next film was Epidemic  1987   which was also shown at Cannes in the Un Certain Regard section  The film is partly a dark science fiction tale of a future plague epidemic  and partly chronicles two filmmakers  played by Lars von Trier and screenwriter Niels Vørsel  preparing that film  with the two storylines ultimately colliding   For television von Trier directed Medea  1988   which won the Jean d Arcy prize in France  It was based on a screenplay by Carl Th  Dreyer and starred Udo Kier   He completed the Europe trilogy in 1991 with Europa  released as Zentropa in the US   which won the Prix du Jury at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival and picked up awards at other major festivals   In 1990 he also directed the music video for the worldwide hit  Bakerman  by Laid Back  This video was reused in 2006 by the English DJ and artist Shaun Baker who did a remake of Bakerman   3  Zentropa and The Kingdom  In 1992 he and producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen founded the movie production company Zentropa Entertainment  named after a train company in Europa  their most recent film at the time  The reason for doing this was to achieve financial independence and to have total creative control  The production company has produced many movies other than von Trier s own as well as television series  It also has produced hardcore sex films  Constance  1998   Pink Prison  1999   HotMen CoolBoyz  2000  and All About Anna  2005    To make money for his newly founded company  he made The Kingdom  Riget  1994  and The Kingdom II  Riget II  1997   a pair of miniseries recorded in the Danish national hospital  the name  Riget  being a colloquial name for the hospital known as Rigshospitalet  lit  The Kingdom s Hospital  in Danish  A projected third instalment in the series was derailed by the 1998 death of Ernst Hugo Järegård  who played Helmer  one of the major characters   4  Dogme 95  In 1995  Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg presented their manifesto for a new cinematic movement which they called Dogme&nbsp 95  It would however take a while before the first of these films appeared  and at this point many thought of the concept mainly as a radical idea with no future   In 1996  von Trier conducted an unusual theatrical experiment in Copenhagen involving 53 actors  which he titled Psychomobile 1  The World Clock  A documentary chronicling the project was directed by Jesper Jargil  and was released in 2000 with the title De Udstillede  The Exhibited    Von Trier s next film  Breaking the Waves  1996   the first film in von Trier s  Golden Heart Trilogy   won the Grand Prix at Cannes and featured Emily Watson  who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress  Its grainy images and hand held photography pointed towards Dogme 95  The second was The Idiots  1998   nominated for a Palme d Or  which he presented in person at the Cannes Film Festival notwithstanding his dislike of travelling  Dancer in the Dark  2000  was the final component of the trilogy   As originator of the Dogme 95 concept  which has led to international interest in Danish film as a whole  he has inspired filmmakers all over the world  Trier and Thomas Vinterberg  who created the Dogme 95 Manifesto and the  Vow of Chastity  together with their fellow Dogme directors Kristian Levring and Søren Kragh Jacobsen shared in 2008 the European Film Award European Achievement in World Cinema   5  Explicit images  Von Trier s use of sexually explicit images in The Idiots  1998  started a wave of arthouse mainstream films with unsimulated sex  such as Catherine Breillat s Romance  1999   Baise Moi  2000   Intimacy  2001   Vincent Gallo s The Brown Bunny  2003  and Michael Winterbottom s 9 songs  2004    In 1998  Lars von Trier also made history by having his company Zentropa be the world s first mainstream film company to produce hardcore pornographic films  Three of these films  Constance  1998   Pink Prison  1999  and the adult mainstream crossover feature All About Anna  2005   were made primarily for a female audience  and were extremely successful in Europe  with the first two being directly responsible for the March 2006 legalising of pornography in Norway   Lars von Trier s initiative spearheaded a European wave of female friendly porn films from directors such as Anna Span  Erika Lust and Petra Joy  while von Trier s company Zentropa was forced to abandon the experiment due to pressure from English business partners  In July 2009  women s magazine Cosmopolitan ranked Pink Prison as No  1 in its Top Five of the best women s porn  calling it the  role model for the new porn generation   Lars von Trier would return to explicit images in his self directed Antichrist  2009   exploring darker themes  but ran into problems when he tried once more with Nymphomaniac  which had ninety minutes cut out  reducing it from 5½ to 4 hours  for its international release in 2013 in order to be commercially viable  taking nearly a year to be shown complete anywhere in an uncensored Director s Cut   6  2000s  In 2000  von Trier premiered a musical featuring Icelandic musician Björk  Dancer in the Dark  The film won the Palme d Or at Cannes  The song  I ve Seen It All   which Trier co wrote  received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song   The Five Obstructions  2003   made by Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth  is a documentary  but also incorporates lengthy sections of experimental films  The premise is that Lars von Trier challenges director Jørgen Leth  his friend and mentor  to remake his old experimental film The Perfect Human  1967  five times  each time with a different  obstruction   or obstacle  specified by von Trier   He then directed two films in his announced  US trilogy   Dogville  2003   starring Nicole Kidman and Manderlay  2005   starring Bryce Dallas Howard in the same role – as Grace  Both films are extremely stylised  with the actors playing their parts on a nearly empty soundstage with little but chalk marks on the floor to indicate the sets  Both films had huge casts of major international actors  Harriet Andersson  Lauren Bacall  James Caan  Danny Glover  Willem Dafoe  etc    and questioned various issues relating to American society  such as intolerance in Dogville and slavery in Manderlay   Controversy erupted on the 2004 set for Manderlay when actor John C  Reilly walked off the Trollhättan  Sweden  set in late March  Reilly walked off the film when he learned that an upcoming scene involved the slaughter of a donkey for food  The film s producer says the animal—who was old and not expected to live much longer—was killed off camera by a certified veterinarian  in accordance with Swedish law  Reilly was replaced by Željko Ivanek   The US was also the scene for Dear Wendy  2005   a feature film directed by von Trier s  Dogme brother  Thomas Vinterberg from a script by von Trier  It starred Jamie Bell and Bill Pullman and dealt with gun worship and violence in American society   In 2006  von Trier released a Danish language comedy film  The Boss of It All  It was shot using a process that von Trier has called Automavision  which involves the director choosing the best possible fixed camera position and then allowing a computer to randomly choose when to tilt  pan or zoom   It was followed by an autobiographical film  De unge år  Erik Nietzsche sagaen del 1  2007   scripted by von Trier but directed by Jacob Thuesen  which tells the story of von Trier s years as a student at the National Film School of Denmark  It stars Jonatan Spang as von Trier s alter ego  called  Erik Nietzsche   and is narrated by von Trier himself  All main characters in the film are based on real people from the Danish film industry  with the thinly veiled portrayals including Jens Albinus as director Nils Malmros  Dejan Čukić as screenwriter Mogens Rukov and Søren Pilmark in an especially unflattering portrayal as sex obsessed school principal Henning Camre   Von Trier s next feature film was Antichrist  an art film about  a grieving couple who retreat to their cabin in the woods  hoping a return to Eden will repair their broken hearts and troubled marriage  but nature takes its course and things go from bad to worse   The film  which includes sexually explicit content  stars Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg  It premiered in competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival  where the festival s jury honoured the movie by giving the Best Actress award to Gainsbourg  The Cannes Film Festival Ecumenical Jury  which gives prizes for movies that promote spiritual  humanist and universal values  also  honoured  the film with a special  anti award   a spokesman for the jury described it as  the most misogynist movie from the self proclaimed biggest director in the world   In 2010 the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported on their website that the film production company Zentropa is reportedly making more revenue from suing movie pirates in Germany that have downloaded Antichrist illegally than from box office and DVD sales  demanding a payment of around 1 300 euros per download to avoid legal action   7  2010s  In 2011 Von Trier released Melancholia  a psychological disaster drama that was shot between 22 July and 8 September 2010 at Film i Väst s studios in Trollhättan  Sweden  exterior scenes were filmed in the area surrounding the Tjolöholm Castle   Magnolia Pictures acquired the distribution rights for North America  The film was in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival   Following Melancholia  von Trier commenced the production of Nymphomaniac  a film about the sexual awakening of a woman played by Charlotte Gainsbourg  The director explained his inspiration for the project   my DP on  Melancholia   Manuel Claro  at one point voiced a surprising prejudice  He urged me not to fall into the trap that so many aging directors fall into – that the women get younger and younger and nuder and nuder  That s all I needed to hear  I most definitely intend for the women in my films to get younger and younger and nuder and nuder  In early December 2013  a four hour version of the five and a half hour film was shown to the press in a private preview session and the cast also includes Stellan Skarsgård  in his sixth von Trier film   Shia LaBeouf  Willem Dafoe  Jamie Bell  Christian Slater and Uma Thurman  In response to claims that he has merely created a  porn film   Skarsgård stated       if you look at this film  it s actually a really bad porn movie  even if you fast forward  And after a while you find you don t even react to the explicit scenes  They become as natural as seeing someone eating a bowl of cereal   Von Trier refused to attend the private screening due to the negative response that he received to Nazi related remarks at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival  which led to his expulsion from the festival  In the director s defense  Skarsgård stated at the screening   Everyone knows he s not a Nazi  and it was disgraceful the way the press had these headlines saying he was    For its public release in the UK  the four hour version of Nymphomaniac was divided into two volumes—Volume I and Volume II—and the film s UK premiere was on 22 February 2014  In interviews prior to the UK release date  Gainsbourg and co star Stacy Martin revealed that prosthetic vaginas  body doubles  and special effects were used for the production of the film  Martin also stated that the film s characters are a reflection of the director himself and referred to the experience as an  honour  that she enjoyed   The film was also released in two volumes for the Australian release on 20 March 2014  with an interval separating the back to back sections  In his review of the film for 3RRR film criticism program   Plato s Cave   presenter Josh Nelson stated that  since the production of Breaking the Waves  the filmmaker that Von Trier is most akin to is Alfred Hitchcock  due to his portrayal of feminine issues  Nelson also mentioned filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky as another influence  who Von Trier himself has also cited   In February 2014  an uncensored version of Volume I was shown at the Berlin Film Festival  with no announcement of when or if the complete five and a half hour Nymphomaniac would be made available to the public   8  Phobias  Von Trier suffers from multiple phobias  including an intense fear of flying  His fear of air travel frequently places severely limiting constraints on him and his crew  necessitating that virtually all of his films be shot in either Denmark or Sweden  even those set in the United States or other foreign countries  Von Trier has had a number of his films featured at the Cannes Film Festival over the course of his career  and each time has insisted on driving from Denmark to France for the festival and back   On numerous occasions von Trier has also stated that he suffers from occasional depression which renders him incapable of performing his work and unable to fulfill social obligations   9  Filming techniques  Lars von Trier has said that  a film should be like a stone in your shoe   To create original art he feels that filmmakers must distinguish themselves stylistically from other films  often by placing restrictions on the filmmaking process  The most famous restriction is the cinematic  vow of chastity  of the Dogme95 movement with which he is associated  though only one of his films  The Idiots  is an actual Dogme 95 film  In Dancer in the Dark  jump shots and dramatically different color palettes and camera techniques were used for the  real world  and musical portions of the film  and in Dogville everything was filmed on a sound stage with no set where the walls of the buildings in the fictional town were marked as lines on the floor   Von Trier often shoots digitally and operates the camera himself  preferring to continuously shoot the actors in character without stopping between takes  In Dogville he let actors stay in character for hours  in the style of method acting  These techniques often put great strain on actors  most famously with Björk during the filming of Dancer in the Dark  Often he uses the same regular group of actors in many of his films  some of his frequently used actors are Jean Marc Barr  Udo Kier and Stellan Skarsgård   He is heavily influenced by the work of Carl Theodor Dreyer and the film The Night Porter  He was so inspired by the short film The Perfect Human directed by Jørgen Leth that he challenged Leth to redo the short five times in feature film The Five Obstructions   10  Trilogies  Von Trier has on occasion referred to his films as falling into thematic and stylistic trilogies  This pattern began with his first feature film  marking the beginning of The Europa trilogy  though he claims a trilogy was not initially planned  instead being applied to the films in retrospect  The Europe trilogy illuminated the traumas of Europe in the past and future  This trilogy includes The Element of Crime  1984   Epidemic  1987  and Europa  1991    The Golden Heart trilogy was about naive heroines who maintain their  golden hearts  despite the tragedies they experience  This trilogy consists of Breaking the Waves  1996   The Idiots  1998  and Dancer in the Dark  2000   While all three films are sometimes associated with the Dogme 95 movement  only The Idiots is a certified Dogme 95 film   The USA  Land of Opportunities trilogy follows the character of Grace  and is set in a stylised American past  Von Trier has stated he was inspired to make a trilogy about the United States as a reaction to Americans at the Cannes film festival who said he had no right to make the Dancer in the Dark  which was often viewed as being critical of a country he has never been to  and has no intention of ever visiting  due to his phobia of travel   however  von Trier himself has stated in interviews he did not intend it to be a criticism of America  saying the film takes place in a  fictional America   Von Trier proposed the films as ‘a series of sermons on America’s sins and hypocrisy’  inspired by the fact that American movie makers have made many movies about places across the world to which they have not travelled  All three movies will be shot in the same distinctive style  on a bare sound stage with no set and buildings marked by lines on the floor  This style is inspired by 1970s televised theatre  The trilogy will consist of Dogville  2003   Manderlay  2005  and the so far not produced Wasington   The Depression Trilogy consists of Antichrist  Melancholia and Nymphomaniac  All three star Charlotte Gainsbourg and deal with characters who suffer depression or grief in different ways  This trilogy is said to represent the depression that von Trier himself experiences   The Kingdom  Riget  was planned as a trilogy of three seasons with 13 episodes in total  but the third season was not filmed due to death of star Ernst Hugo Järegård shortly after completion of the second season   11  Controversy at 2011 Cannes Film Festival  On 19 May 2011  Cannes Film Festival s board of directors declared von Trier persona non grata for comments he made during a press conference for his film Melancholia the day before  an unprecedented move for the film festival  Responding to a question by The Times film critic Kate Muir about his German roots and his comments in a Danish film magazine about the Nazi aesthetic  von Trier claimed to have some sympathy for and understanding of Adolf Hitler  and then jokingly claimed to be a Nazi himself   Referring to the art of Nazi architect Albert Speer  von Trier added        he had some talent that was kind of possible for him to use during     Ok  I m a Nazi   Then  to Toronto Star film critic Peter Howell  who questioned whether Melancholia could be an answer to Hollywood blockbusters and asked von Trier if he could  envision doing a film on a grander scale than this   von Trier replied   On a grander scale  Yeah  Yeah that s what we Nazis  we have a tendency to try to do things on a greater scale  Yeah  maybe you could persuade me into the final solution with journalists    Hours later  von Trier released a brief statement of apology about his comments at the press conference   If I have hurt someone this morning by the words I said at the press conference  I sincerely apologise  I am not anti semitic or racially prejudiced in any way  nor am I a Nazi   The next day  the festival directors held an extraordinary meeting  deciding his remarks were  unacceptable  intolerable and contrary to the ideals of humanity and generosity that preside over the very existence of the festival        The board of directors condemns these comments and declares Lars von Trier persona non grata at the Festival de Cannes  with effect immediately    Afterwards  von Trier held a news conference of his own in Danish  His first remark to the Danish journalists was   If any of you journalists will beat me  so just do it  I will enjoy it   He went on to say that  The Holocaust is the worst crime that ever happened  I have nothing against Jews  I have a Jewish name  and all my children have Jewish names   He admitted that his remarks about the Nazis had been misguided  saying  It was really stupidly done and it was in the wrong forum  At the press conference with Danish journalists  there were no problems  but I do not think the international journalists understand my Danish humor   But he also said he was proud to have been kicked out of the Cannes festival   I am proud to have been declared  persona non grata   It is perhaps the first time in cinematic history  it has happened      I think one reason is that French people treated the Jews badly during World War II  Therefore  it is a sensitive topic for them  I respect the Cannes festival very highly  but I also understand that they are very angry at me right now    Speaking to other news outlets he said that his comments were  very sarcastic and very rude  but that s very Danish   He also added   I don t sympathize with Hitler for one second   He explained to the New York Times in May 2011   I got carried away  I feel this obligation  which is completely stupid and very unprofessional  to kind of entertain the crowd a little bit    In the October 2011 issue of GQ  von Trier is quoted in an interview saying he was not really sorry for the comments he made  only sorry he didn t make it clear that he was joking  He added   I can t be sorry for what I said—it s against my nature   On 5 October 2011  von Trier was interviewed by police in Denmark about his remarks at Cannes  Afterwards  he announced that he had  decided from this day forth to refrain from all public statements and interviews    In keeping with his announcement in October 2011  Von Trier did not attend a private press screening of his 2013 film Nymphomaniac  Skarsgård stated in December 2013  following a Copenhagen screening of the film   The explosions in Cannes had nothing to do with Lars     and that s why he doesn t want to talk  because he feels insecure  He feels that whatever he says can be turned into something outrageous   At the screening of Nymphomaniac at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2014  Von Trier attended a photocall wearing a t shirt that had the words  Persona non grata  and the golden leaf logo of the Cannes Film Festival   12  Honors  Von Trier was made a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog on 14 January 1997  Ten years later von Trier decided to hand back the prize  saying that the Danish royal family are just  simple people of bad quality    Sight & Sound magazine conducts a poll every ten years of the world s finest film directors to find out the Ten Greatest Films of All Time  This poll has been going since 1992  and has become the most recognised poll of its kind in the world  In 2012  Cyrus Frisch voted for  Dancer in the Dark   Frisch commented   A superbly imaginative film that leaves conformity in shambles    13  Personal life  In 1989  Von Trier s mother revealed on her deathbed that the man who he thought was his father was not  and that she had had a tryst with her former employer  Fritz Michael Hartmann  1909–2000   who descended from a long line of Roman Catholic classical musicians  his grandfather was Emil Hartmann  his great grandfather J P E  Hartmann  his uncles included Niels Gade and Johan Ernst Hartmann and thus Niels Viggo Bentzon was his cousin   She stated that she did this to give her son  artistic genes    Until that point I thought I had a Jewish background  But I m really more of a Nazi  I believe that my biological father s German family went back two further generations  Before she died  my mother told me to be happy that I was the son of this other man  She said my foster father had had no goals and no strength  But he was a loving man  And I was very sad about this revelation  And you then feel manipulated when you really do turn out to be creative  If I d known that my mother had this plan  I would have become something else  I would have shown her  The slut  During the German occupation of Denmark  Fritz Michael Hartmann worked as a civil servant and joined a resistance group  Frit Danmark   actively counteracting any pro German and pro Nazi colleagues in his department  Another member of this infiltrative resistance group was Hartmann s colleague Viggo Kampmann  who would later become prime minister of Denmark   After four awkward meetings with his biological father  the man refused further contact  The revelations led von Trier to attempt to  erase  the connections with his stepfather by converting to Catholicism  and to rework his filmmaking into a style emphasising  honesty    I don t know if I m all that Catholic really  I m probably not  Denmark is a very Protestant country  Perhaps I only turned Catholic to piss off a few of my countrymen  In 2009  he declared   I m a very bad Catholic  In fact I m becoming more and more of an atheist    14  Filmography  15  References  15 1  Notes  15 2  Further reading  Stühl  Leo  2012
