Meat Puppets are an American rock band formed in January 1980  in Phoenix  Arizona  The group s original lineup was Curt Kirkwood  guitar vocals   his brother Cris Kirkwood  bass guitar   and Derrick Bostrom  drums   The Kirkwood brothers met Bostrom while attending Brophy Prep High School in Phoenix  The three then moved to Tempe  Arizona  a Phoenix suburb and home to Arizona State University  where the Kirkwood brothers purchased two adjacent homes  one of which had a shed in the back where they regularly practiced   One of the more notable groups on the roster of SST Records  who released most of their albums   Meat Puppets started as a punk rock band  but like most of their SST peers  Meat Puppets established their own unique style  blending punk with country and psychedelic rock  and featuring Curt s warbling vocals  Meat Puppets later gained significant exposure when the Kirkwood brothers served as guest musicians on Nirvana s MTV Unplugged performance in 1993  The band s 1994 album Too High to Die subsequently became their most successful release  The band broke up twice  in 1996 and 2002  but reunited again in 2006   Meat Puppets have influenced various rock bands such as Nirvana  Soundgarden  Dinosaur Jr  Sebadoh and Pavement   1  History  1 1  Early career  1980–1990   In the late 70 s  drummer Derrick Bostrom played with guitarist Jack Knetzger in a band called Atomic Bomb Club  which began as a duo  but would come to include bassist Cris Kirkwood  The band played a few local shows and recorded some demos  but began to dissolve quickly thereafter  Derrick and Cris began rehearsing together with Cris  brother Curt Kirkwood by learning songs from Bostrom s collection of punk rock 45s  After briefly toying with the name The Bastions of Immaturity  they settled on the name Meat Puppets in June  1980 after a song by Curt of the same name which appears on their first album  Their early works were made up of hardcore punk  and attracted the attention of Joe Carducci as he was starting to work with legendary punk label SST Records  Carducci suggested they sign with the label  and the Meat Puppets released their first album Meat Puppets in 1982  which among several new originals and a pair of heavily skewed Doc Watson and Bob Nolan covers  featured the songs  The Gold Mine  and  Melons Rising   two tunes Derrick and Cris originally had written and performed as Atomic Bomb Club previously   By the release of 1984 s Meat Puppets II  the bandmembers  were so sick of the hardcore thing   according to Bostrom   We were really into pissing off the crowd   The band experimented with acid rock and country western sounds  While the album had been recorded in early 1983  the album s release was delayed for a year by SST  Meat Puppets II turned the band into one of the leading bands on SST Records  and along with the Violent Femmes  the Gun Club and others  helped establish the genre called  cow punk    Meat Puppets II was followed by 1985 s Up on the Sun  The album s sound resembled the folk rock of The Byrds more than punk  and some of the group s fans accused Meat Puppets of sounding dangerously like hippies and abandoning their punk roots  In keeping with their unconventional way of doing things  both Cris and Curt purposefully sang the entire album off key   Over the next decade  Meat Puppets remained on SST and released a series of albums while touring relentlessly  Between tours they would regularly play small shows in bars around the Phoenix area such as  The Mason Jar  and  The Sun Club  in Tempe  After the release of Out My Way in 1986  however  the band was briefly sidelined by an accident when Curt s finger was broken after being slammed in their touring van s door  The accident delayed the band s next album  the psychedelic Mirage  until the next year  The final result was considered their most polished sounding album to date   Their next album  the heavier Huevos  came out less than six months afterward  in late summer of 1987  In stark contrast to its predecessor  Huevos was recorded in a swift  fiery fashion  with many first takes  and minimal second guessing  These recordings were completed in only a matter of days  and along with a few drawings and one of Curt s paintings taken from the wall to serve as cover art  a dish of three boiled eggs  a green pepper  and a bottle of Tabasco sauce   were all sent to SST shortly before the band returned to the road en route to their next gig  Curt revealed in an interview that one of the reasons for the album being called Huevos  meaning  eggs  in Spanish  was because of the multitude of first takers on the record  as similarly eggs can only be used once   Monsters was released in 1989  featuring a new sound with extended jams such as  Touchdown King  and  Flight of the Fire Weasel    1 2  Major label career  1991–1995   As numerous bands from the seminal SST label and other kindred punk oriented indies had before them  Meat Puppets grappled with the decision to switch to a major label  Two years after their final studio recording for SST  1989 s Monsters the trio released its major label debut  Forbidden Places  on the indie friendly London Records  Forbidden Places is now out of print   In late 1993  Meat Puppets achieved mainstream popularity when Nirvana s Kurt Cobain  who became a fan after seeing them open for Black Flag  invited Cris and Curt to join him on MTV Unplugged for acoustic performances of  Plateau    Oh Me  and  Lake of Fire   all originally from Meat Puppets II   The resulting album  MTV Unplugged in New York  served as a swan song for Nirvana  as Cobain died 138 days after the concert   Lake of Fire  became a cult favorite for its particularly wrenching vocal performance from Cobain  Subsequently  the Nirvana exposure and the strength of the single  Backwater   their only charting single  helped lift Meat Puppets to new commercial heights  The band s studio return was 1994 s Too High To Die  produced by Butthole Surfers guitarist Paul Leary  The album featured  Backwater   a minor hit on alternative radio  and a hidden track update of  Lake of Fire   Too High To Die earned the  Pups a gold record  500 000 sold   outselling their previous records combined  1995 s No Joke  was the final album recorded by the original Meat Puppets lineup  Though the band s drug use included cocaine  heroin  LSD and many others  Cris  use of heroin and crack cocaine became so bad he rarely left his house except to obtain more drugs  At least two people  including his wife and one of his best friends  died of overdoses at his house in Tempe  AZ during this time  The Kirkwood brothers had always had a legendary appetite for illegal substances and during the tour to support Too High To Die with Stone Temple Pilots  the easy availability of drugs was too much for Cris  When it was over  he was severely addicted to cocaine   1 3  First hiatus and reunion  1996–2001   Derrick recorded a solo EP under the moniker Today s Sounds in 1996  and later on in 1999 took charge of re issuing the Puppets  original seven records on Rykodisc as well as putting out their first live album  Live in Montana  Curt formed a new band in Austin  TX called the Royal Neanderthal Orchestra  but they changed their name to Meat Puppets for legal reasons and released a promotional EP entitled You Love Me in 1999  Golden Lies in 2000 and Live in 2002  The line up was Curt  voc git   Kyle Ellison  voc git   Andrew Duplantis  voc bass  and Shandon Sahm  drums   Sahm s father was the legendary fiddler singer songwriter Doug Sahm of The Sir Douglas Quintet and Texas Tornados  The concluding track to Classic Puppets entitled  New Leaf  also dates from this incarnation of the band   1 4  Break up  2002–2005   Around 2002  the Meat Puppets dissolved as Curt had gone on to release albums with the groups Eyes Adrift and Volcano  In 2005  he released his first solo album entitled Snow   Bassist Cris was arrested in December 2003 for attacking a security guard at the main post office in downtown Phoenix  AZ with the guard s baton  The guard shot Kirkwood in the stomach at least twice during the melee  causing serious gunshot injuries requiring major surgery  Kirkwood was subsequently denied bail  the judge citing Kirkwood s previous drug arrests and probation violations  He eventually went to prison at the Arizona state prison in Florence  Arizona for felony assault  He was released in July 2005   Derrick Bostrom began a web site for the band about six months before the original trio stopped working together  The site went through many different permutations before it was essentially mothballed in 2003  In late 2005  Bostrom revamped it once again  this time as a  blog  for his recollections and as a place to share pieces of Meat Puppets history   1 5  Second reunion  2006–present   On March 24  2006  Curt Kirkwood polled fans at his MySpace page with a bulletin that asked   Question for all   Would the original line up of the Meat Puppets interest anyone   Feedback is good — do you want a reunion    The response from fans was overwhelmingly positive within a couple of hours  leading to speculation of a full blown Meat Puppets reunion in the near future  However  a post made by Derrick Bostrom on the official Meat Puppets site dismissed the notion   In April 2006 Billboard reported that the Kirkwood brothers would reunite as the Meat Puppets without original drummer Derrick Bostrom  Although Primus drummer Tim Alexander was announced as Bostrom s replacement  the position was later filled by Ted Marcus  The new lineup recorded a new full length album  Rise to Your Knees  in mid to late 2006  The album was released by Anodyne Records on July 17  2007   On January 20  2007  The Meat Puppets brothers performed two songs during an Army of Anyone concert  at La Zona Rosa in Austin  Texas  The first song was played with Curt Kirkwood and Cris Kirkwood along with Army of Anyone s Ray Luzier and Dean DeLeo  Then the second song was played with original members Curt and Cris Kirkwood and new Meat Puppets drummer Ted Marcus  This was in the middle of Army of Anyone s set  which they listed as Meat Puppet Theatre on the evening s set list  The band performed several new songs in March at the South by Southwest festival  On March 28  2007  the band announced a West Coast tour through their MySpace page  This is the first tour with original bassist Cris in eleven years  The tour continued into the east coast and midwest later in 2007   In 2008 they performed their classic second album live in its entirety at the ATP New York festival   The band parted ways with Anodyne  signed to Megaforce and began recording new material in the winter of 2008  The resulting album  entitled Sewn Together  was released on May 12  2009  In the summer of 2009 the band continued to tour across America  They appeared in Rochester Minnesota outside in front of over 5 000 fans  after playing Summerfest in Milwaukee  Wisconsin the night prior  The Meat Puppets performed at the 2009 Voodoo Music Experience in New Orleans over the Halloween weekend   As of November 2009  Shandon Sahm is back as the drummer in the Meat Puppets  replacing Ted Marcus  The band was chosen by Animal Collective to perform the album  Up on the Sun  live in its entirety at the All Tomorrow s Parties festival that they curated in May 2011   The band s thirteenth studio album  entitled Lollipop  was released on April 12  2011  The Dandies supported the Meat Puppets on all European dates in 2011   The Meat Puppets have played several gigs in their hometown since 2009  such as the Marquee show in June 2011 with Dead Confederate   As of early 2011 Elmo Kirkwood  son of Curt Kirkwood and nephew of Cris Kirkwood  was touring regularly with the band playing rhythm guitar   The Meat Puppets also contributed to Spin Magazine s exclusive album Newermind  A Tribute to Nirvana  playing Nirvana s Smells Like Teen Spirit   In June 2012  a book titled Too High to Die  Meet the Meat Puppets by author Greg Prato was released  which featured all new interviews with band
