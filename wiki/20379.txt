A micronation  sometimes referred to as a model country or new country project  is an entity that claims to be an independent nation or state but is not officially recognized by world governments or major international organizations   Micronations are distinguished from imaginary countries and from other kinds of social groups  such as eco villages  campuses  tribes  clans  sects  and residential community associations  by expressing a formal and persistent  even if unrecognized  claim of sovereignty over some physical territory   Several micronations have issued coins  flags  postage stamps  passports  medals  and other items  which are rarely accepted outside of their own community   The earliest known micronations date from the beginning of the 19th century  The advent of the Internet provided the means for people to create many new micronations  whose members are scattered all over the world and interact mostly by electronic means  often calling their nations Nomadic Countries  The differences between such Internet micronations  other kinds of social networking groups  and role playing games are often hard to define   The term  micronation  to describe those entities dates at least to the 1970s  The term micropatrology is sometimes used to describe the study of both micronations and microstates by micronationalists  some of whom refer to sovereign nation states as  macronations    1  Etymology  The term  micronation  literally means  small nation   It is a neologism originating in the mid 1970s to describe the many thousands of small unrecognised state like entities that have mostly arisen since that time  It is generally accepted that the term was invented by Robert Ben Madison   The term has since also come to be used retrospectively to refer to earlier unrecognised entities  some of which date to as far back as the 19th century  Supporters of micronations   micronationalists   use the term  macronation  for any UN recognized sovereign nation state   Not all micronations are small  some can be rather large  like the Dominion of British West Florida or those with claims on Antarctica or other planets   2  Definition  Micronations generally have a number of common features  although these may vary widely  They may have a structure similar to established sovereign states  including territorial claims  government institutions  official symbols and citizens  albeit on a much smaller scale  Micronations are often quite small  in both their claimed territory and claimed populations — although there are some exceptions to this rule  with different micronations having different methods of citizenship  Micronations may also issue formal instruments such as postage stamps  coins  banknotes and passports  and bestow honours and titles of nobility   The Montevideo Convention was one attempt to create a legal definition distinguishing between states and non states  Some micronations meet this definition  while some do not  and others reject the Convention altogether   The academic study of micronations  microstates  and alternative governments is known as micropatrology  and the hobby of establishing and operating micronations is known as micronationalism   3  Categories  In the present day  nine main types of micronations are prevalent   Social  economic  or political simulations   Exercises in personal entertainment or self aggrandisement   Exercises in fantasy or creative fiction   Vehicles for the promotion of an agenda   Entities created for fraudulent purposes   Historical anomalies and aspirant states   New country projects   Exercises in historical revisionism   Alternative governments   3 1  Social  economic  or political simulations  These micronations tend to have a reasonably serious intent  and often involve significant numbers of people interested in recreating the past or simulating political or social processes  Examples include   Freetown Christiania  a semi legal district in Copenhagen  Denmark  Kingdom of Elleore  micronation founded 1944 on the small island of Elleore in the Roskilde Fjord  north of Roskilde on the Danish island of Zealand  Talossa  a political simulation founded in 1979  with more than 200 members   citizens   and an invented culture and language  which split into three separate groups in 2005  of which two united in 2010 to the  Kingdom of Talossa   and the last one vanished into quiescence   Nova Roma  a group claiming a worldwide membership of several thousand that has minted its own coins  maintains its own wiki  and which engages in real life Roman themed re enactments   Grand Duchy of Flandrensis  a Belgian micronation with claims over some territories of Antarctica  The micronation is also a political simulation and cultural organization  In 2012  the micronation is composed of 114 citizens from 21 different nationalities   Republic of Jamtland  a self proclaimed republic in the county of Jämtland  Sweden  It was founded in 1963 due to Sweden s social welfare politics  which wanted Jämtland to merge with the county of Västernorrland and wanted more people to move away from the countryside of northern Sweden and into the big cities of southern Sweden  This started protests in Jämtland and later that year they declared themselves a free republic within the Kingdom of Sweden  The Republic of Jämtland has a population of 130 573 inhabitants and has an area of 19 090 4 square miles  Jämtland also has embassies and consulates in 17 different countries  such as China  Germany  the USA  England  Norway and Russia  In 1967  Yngve Gamlin  the president of the republic at that time  went to see the Swedish prime minister Tage Erlander about merging with Västernorrland county  Yngve was greeted at Harpsund estate by Tage as a chief of state on a state visit to Sweden  This gave Jamtland some recognition from Sweden as a free republic  This event has  however  been debated whether it should be seen as formal recognition or not   3 2  Exercises in personal entertainment or self aggrandisement  With literally thousands in existence  micronations of the second type are by far the most common  This type can also be known as  political simulationism  or simply  simulationism   They generally exist  for fun   have relatively few participants  are ephemeral  today usually Internet based  and many do not survive more than a few months—although there are notable exceptions  They are usually concerned solely with arrogating to their founders the outward symbols of statehood  The use of grand sounding titles  awards  honours  and heraldic symbols derived from European feudal traditions  the conduct of  wars   often known as recwars  and  diplomacy  with other micronations  and simulated continents or planets are common manifestations of their activities  Examples include   The Aerican Empire  a Monty Pythonesque micronation founded in 1987 and known for its tongue in cheek interplanetary land claims  smiley faced flag and a range of national holidays  called  niftydays   because  there s nothing holy about them   that includes  Topin Wagglegammon  amongst others   Republic of Molossia  a desert based micronation of 0 5 ha  1 3 acres  located near Reno  Nevada ruled by President Kevin Baugh  founded in 1977  There is a nationwide ban on smoking   The Kingdom of Lovely is an attempt by King Danny I  Danny Wallace  to create an internet nation based in his flat in London  the central feature of his 2005 TV series How to Start Your Own Country   Grand Duchy of Flandrensis  a micronation that has claimed five islands of the West Antarctica  issued its own identity cards  currency and newspaper   3 3  Exercises in fantasy or creative fiction  Micronations of the third type include stand alone artistic projects  deliberate exercises in creative online fiction  social justification or gratification  and artistamp creations  Examples include   The Republic of Kugelmugel  founded by an Austrian artist and based in a ball shaped house in Vienna  which quickly became a tourist attraction   The Copeman Empire  run from a caravan park in Norfolk  England  by its founder Nick Copeman  who changed his name by deed poll to HM King Nicholas I  He and his empire are the subject of a book and a website where King Nicholas sells knighthoods   San Serriffe  an April Fool s Day hoax created by the British newspaper The Guardian  in its April 1  1977 edition  The fictional island nation was described in an elaborate seven page supplement and has been revisited by the newspaper several times   Republic of Saugeais  République du Saugeais   a fifty year old  republic  in the French département of Doubs  bordering Switzerland  The republic is made of the 11 municipalities of Les Allies  Arcon  Bugny  La Chaux de Gilley  Gilley  Hauterive la Fresne  La Longeville  Montflovin  Maisons du Bois Lievremont  Ville du Pont  and its capital Montbenoit  It had a  president —Georgette Bertin Pourchet  elected in 2006—a  prime minister  and numerous  citizens   It was born from a joke between a Sauget resident and the local Préfet   3 4  Vehicles for agenda promotion  These types of micronations are typically associated with a political or social reform agenda  Some are maintained as media and public relations exercises  Examples of this type include   Akhzivland is a self declared and officially tolerated  independent republic  established by Israeli hippie and former sailor Eli Avivi on the Mediterranean beach at Akhziv in Israel   The Conch Republic  which began in 1982 as a protest by residents and business owners in the Florida Keys against a United States Border Patrol roadblock  It has since been maintained as a tourism booster  and the group has engaged in other protests   The Republic of New Afrika  a controversial separatist group seeking the creation of an independent black nationalist state across much of the Southeastern U S   Republic of Lakotah  a proposed republic for the American Indian Lakota people of North and South Dakota  eastern Montana and eastern Wyoming  and northern Nebraska   Valašské královstí  Kingdom of Wallachia  is a tongue in cheek micronation established by Tomáš Harabiš  with the Czech actor Bolek Polívka as its king in 1997 in the territory of Moravian Wallachia  for the purpose of promoting the region and tourist activities  The micronation has been registered as a tourist agency in 2000  The micronation suffered a coup d état during which Polívka was stripped of his throne and ousted from the kingdom   3 5  Entities created for allegedly fraudulent purposes  A number of micronations have been established for fraudulent purposes  by seeking to link questionable or illegal financial actions with seemingly legitimate nations   The Territory of Poyais was invented by Scottish adventurer and South American independence hero Gregor MacGregor in the early 19th century  On the basis of a land grant made to him by the Anglophile native King of the Mosquito people in what is present day Honduras  MacGregor wove one of history s most elaborate hoaxes  managing to charm the highest levels of London s political and financial establishment with tales of the bucolic  resource rich country he claimed to rule as a benevolent sovereign prince  or  Cazique   when he arrived in the UK in 1822   The Dominion of Melchizedek has been widely condemned for promoting fraudulent banking activities and other financial scams  and for the involvement by one of its founders in the attempted secession of the Fijian island of Rotuma   New Utopia  operated by Oklahoma City longevity promoter Howard Turney as a libertarian new country project was stopped by a United States federal court temporary restraining order from selling bonds and bank licenses  New Utopia has claimed for a number of years to be on the verge of commencing construction of an artificial island territory located approximately midway between Honduras and Cuba  on the Misteriosa Bank but no such project has yet been undertaken   The Kingdom of EnenKio  which claims Wake Atoll in the Marshall Islands belonging to the US minor outlying islands  has been condemned by the governments of the Marshall Islands and of the United States for selling passports and diplomatic papers  On April 23  1998  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Marshall Islands issued an official Circular Note  denouncing representatives of both  EnenKio  and  Melchizedek  for making fraudulent representations   The United Kingdom of Atlantis operated a website that ceased to function in 2005  and claimed to be located in the Pacific Ocean near Australia  The  kingdom  published maps of its alleged location  however  the islands shown did not exist  Atlantis  leader  the self styled Sheikh Yakub Al Sheikh Ibrahim  was wanted in the US for various crimes including fraud and money laundering  At one point  Atlantis sent a delegation to the legitimate state of Palau to offer a low interest loan of $100 million   3 6  Historical anomalies  legal anomalies and aspirant states  A small number of micronations are founded based on historical anomalies or on legal anomalies  deriving from disputed interpretations of law   These types of micronations are usually located on small  usually disputed  territorial enclaves  generate limited economic activity founded on tourism and philatelic and numismatic sales  and are tolerated or ignored by the nations from which they claim to have seceded  This category includes   Seborga  a town in the region of Liguria  Italy  near the southern end of the border with France  which traces its history back to the Middle Ages   The Principality of Hutt River  formerly  Hutt River Province    a farm in Western Australia  claims to have seceded from Australia to become an independent principality  with a worldwide population numbered in the tens of thousands   The Principality of Sealand  a World War II era anti aircraft platform built in the North Sea beyond Britain s then territorial limit  seized by a pirate radio group in 1967 as a base for their operations  and currently used as the site of a secure web hosting facility  Sealand has continued to promote its independence by issuing stamps  money  and appointing an official national athlete  It has been described as the  world s most notorious micronation  as well as the  world s smallest and weirdest country    The Crown Dependency of Forvik is an island in Shetland  currently recognized as part of UK  Stuart Hill claims that independence comes from an arrangement struck in 1468 between King Christian I of Denmark Norway and Scotland s James III  whereby Christian pawned the Shetland Islands to James in order to raise money for his daughter s dowry  Hill claims that the dowry was never paid and therefore it is not part of UK and should be a crown dependency like the Isle of Man  Hill has also encouraged the rest of Shetland to declare independence   3 7  New country projects  New country projects are attempts to found completely new nation states  They typically involve plans to construct artificial islands  few of which are ever realised   and a large percentage have embraced or purported to embrace libertarian or democratic principles  Examples include   Operation Atlantis  an early 1970s New York–based libertarian group  built a concrete hulled ship called Freedom  which they sailed to the Caribbean  intending to permanently anchor it as their  territory   The ship sank in a hurricane and the project collapsed with it   Republic of Minerva  another libertarian project that succeeded in building a small man made island on the Minerva Reefs south of Fiji in 1972 before being invaded by troops from Tonga  who formally annexed it before destroying the island   Principality of Freedonia  a libertarian project that was falsely reported to have tried to lease territory from the Sultan of Awdal in Somaliland in 2001  After the men from Awdal Roads Company were deported  resulting public dissatisfaction led to rioting  and the reported death of a Somali   Republic of Rose Island  an artificial island constructed in 1968 by Italian architect Giorgio Rosa in the Adriatic Sea  The structure was originally built as a tourist attraction  but soon after it was finished  Rosa declared sovereignty   Oceania  also known as  The Atlantis Project   but unrelated to the 1970s project listed above   another libertarian artificial island project that raised US$400 000 before going bankrupt in 1994   Seasteading  a project aimed at building competitive governments at sea   Global Country of World Peace   a country without borders for peace loving people everywhere   was declared by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 2000  It made several attempts to buy or lease land for a sovereign territory  It is currently governed by Maharaja Tony Nader  Its currency is the RAAM and its capitals include Maharishi Vedic City  Iowa and MERU  Holland   3 8  Exercises in historical revisionism  In Germany  numerous individuals and groups—collectively labeled Kommissarische Reichsregierungen  KRR —assert that the German Empire continues to exist in its pre World War II borders and that they are its government  or government in exile   3 9  Alternative governments   Alternative Governments  are mostly defined as  a government that declares itself to be an authority over a set territory  but do not recognize themselves as the only or sole authority on said territory     Some alternative governments include    Republic for the United States of America   formed in 2010  which gained notoriety when Iowa Republican Senate candidate Randi Shannon joined in 2012   4  History  4 1  Early history and evolution  The oldest extant micronation to arise in modern times is the Kingdom of Redonda  founded in 1865 in the Caribbean  It failed to establish itself as a real country  but has nonetheless managed to survive into the present day as a unique literary foundation with its own king and aristocracy—although it is not without its controversies  there are presently at least four competing claimants to the Redondan throne   Martin Coles Harman  owner of the British island of Lundy in the early decades of the 20th century  declared himself King and issued private coinage and postage stamps for local use  Although the island was ruled as a virtual fiefdom  its owner never claimed to be independent of the United Kingdom  so Lundy can at best be described as a precursor to later territorial micronations  Another example is the Principality of Outer Baldonia  a rocky island off the coast of Nova Scotia  founded by Russell Arundel  chairman of the Pepsi Cola Company  later  PepsiCo   in 1945 and comprising a population of 69 fishermen   4 2  History during 1960 to 1980  The 1960s and 1970s witnessed the foundation of a number of territorial micronations  The first of these  Sealand  was established in 1967 on an abandoned World War II gun platform in the North Sea just off the East Anglian coast of England  and has survived into the present day  Others were founded on libertarian principles and involved schemes to construct artificial islands  but only three are known to have had even limited success in realizing that goal   The Republic of Rose Island was a platform built in 1968 in Italian national waters in the Adriatic Sea  off the Italian town of Rimini  It is known to have issued stamps  and to have declared Esperanto to be its official language  Shortly after completion  however  it was seized and destroyed by the Italian Navy for failing to pay state taxes   In the late 1960s  Leicester Hemingway  brother of author Ernest  was involved in another such project—a small timber platform in international waters off the west coast of Jamaica  This territory  consisting of an by barge  he called  New Atlantis   Hemingway was an honorary citizen and President  however  the structure was damaged by storms and finally pillaged by Mexican fishermen  In 1973  Hemingway was reported to have moved on from New Atlantis to promoting a platform near the Bahamas  The new country was called  Tierra del Mar   Land of the Sea    Ernest Hemingway s adopted hometown of Key West was later itself part of another micronation  see Conch Republic    The Republic of Minerva was set up in 1972 as a libertarian new country project by Nevada businessman Michael Oliver  Oliver s group conducted dredging operations at the Minerva Reefs  a shoal located in the Pacific Ocean south of Fiji  They succeeded in creating a small artificial island  but their efforts at securing international recognition met with little success  and near neighbour Tonga sent a military force to the area and annexed it   On April 1  1977  bibliophile Richard Booth declared the Welsh town of Hay on Wye an independent kingdom with himself as its monarch  The town subsequently developed a healthy tourism industry based on literary interests  and  King Richard   whose sceptre is a recycled toilet plunger  continues to award Hay on Wye peerages and honours to anyone prepared to pay for them   4 3  Japanese micronations in the 1980s  In 1981  drawing on a news report about Leicester Hemingway s  New Atlantis   novelist Inoue Hisashi wrote a 700 page work of magic realism  Kirikirijin  about a village that secedes from Japan and proclaims its bumpkinish  marginalized dialect its national language  and its subsequent war of independence  This single handedly inspired a large number of Japanese villages  mostly in the northern regions  to  declare independence   generally as a move to raise awareness of their unique culture and crafts for urban Japanese who saw village life as backwards and uncultured  These micronations even held  international summits  from 1983 to 1985  and some of them formed confederations  Throughout the 1980s there was a  micronation boom  in Japan that brought many urban tourists to these wayward villages  But the harsh economic impact of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1991 ended the boom  Many of the villages were forced to merge with larger cities  and the micronations and confederations were generally dissolved   4 4  Australian and New Zealand developments  Micronational developments that occurred in New Zealand and Australia in the final three decades of the 20th century included   The Principality of Hutt River was founded in 1970  when Leonard Casley declared his property independent after a dispute over wheat quotas   1976 witnessed the creation of the Province of Bumbunga on a rural property near Snowtown  South Australia  by an eccentric British monarchist   The Sovereign State of Aeterna Lucina was created in a hamlet on the New South Wales north coast in 1978   In Victoria  a long running dispute over flood damage to farm properties led to the creation of the Independent State of Rainbow Creek in 1979   An anti taxation campaigner founded the Grand Duchy of Avram in western Tasmania in the 1980s   His Grace the Duke of Avram  was later elected to the Tasmanian Parliament   The Independent State of Aramoana was established in New Zealand in 1980   The Empire of Atlantium was established in Sydney  in 1981 as a non territorial global government   The Republic of Whangamomona was established in 1989   A mortgage foreclosure dispute led George and Stephanie Muirhead of Rockhampton  Queensland  to briefly and abortively secede as the Principality of Marlborough in 1993   4 5  Effects of the Internet  Micronationalism shed much of its traditionally eccentric anti establishment mantle and took on a distinctly hobbyist perspective in the mid 1990s  when the emerging popularity of the Internet made it possible to create and promote statelike entities in an entirely electronic medium with relative ease  An early example is the Kingdom of Talossa  a micronation created in 1979 by then 14 year old Robert Ben Madison  which went online in November 1995  and was reported in the New York Times and other print media in 2000  As a result  the number of exclusively online  fantasy or simulation based micronations expanded dramatically   The activities of these types of micronations are almost exclusively limited to simulations of diplomatic activity  including the signing of  treaties  and participation in  supra micronational  forums such as the League of Micronations  and contribution to wikis  With the introduction of the Internet  many articles on how to create micronations were made available on such wikis  which serve as a hub of online activity for micronations   A number of traditional territorial micronations  including the Hutt River Province  Seborga  and Sealand  maintain websites that serve largely to promote their claims and sell merchandise   5  Legitimacy  In international law  the Montevideo Convention on the Right and Duties of States sets down the criteria for statehood in article 1  The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications   a  a permanent population   b  a defined territory   c  government  and  d  capacity to enter into relations with the other states   The first sentence of article 3 of the Montevideo Convention explicitly states that  The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states    Under these guidelines  any entity which meets all of the criteria set forth in article 1 can be regarded as sovereign under international law  whether or not other states have recognized it   The Sovereign Military Order of Malta  as an independent subject of international law does not meet all the criteria for recognition as a State  however it does not claim itself a State either   but is and has been recognized as a sovereign nation for centuries   The doctrine of territorial integrity does not effectively prohibit unilateral secession from established states in international law  per the relevant section from the text of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  also known as the Helsinki Final Act  Helsinki Accords or Helsinki Declaration   In effect  this states that other states  i e   third parties   may not encourage secession in a state  This does not make any statement as regards persons within a state electing to secede of their own accord   6  Academic  literary  and media attention  There has been a small but growing amount of attention paid to the micronation phenomenon in recent years  Most interest in academic circles has been concerned with studying the apparently anomalous legal situations affecting such entities as Sealand and the Hutt River Province  in exploring how some micronations represent grassroots political ideas  and in the creation of role playing entities for instructional purposes   In 2000  Professor Fabrice O Driscoll  of the Aix Marseille University  published a book about micronations  Ils ne siègent pas à l ONU   They are not in the United Nations    with more than 300 pages dedicated to the subject   In May 2000  an article in the New York Times entitled  Utopian Rulers  and Spoofs  Stake Out Territory Online  brought the phenomenon to a wider audience  Similar articles were published by newspapers such as the Italian La Repubblica  O Estado de São Paulo in Brazil  and Portugal s Visão at around the same time   Several recent publications have dealt with the subject of particular historic micronations  including Republic of Indian Stream  University Press   by Dartmouth College geographer Daniel Doan   The Land that Never Was  about Gregor MacGregor and the Principality of Poyais  by David Sinclair  Review  2003  ISBN 0 7553 1080 2  and  An Australian Monarch  about the Principality of Hutt River by William Pitt  CopyRight Publishing  ISBN 9 781876 344672    In August 2003  a summit of micronations took place in Helsinki at Finlandia Hall  the site of the Conference for Security and Co operation in Europe  CSCE   The summit was attended by delegations of the Principality of Sealand  the Kingdoms of Elgaland Vargaland  NSK State in Time  Ladonia  the Transnational republic Transnational Republic  the State of Sabotage and by scholars from various academic institutions   From 7 November through 17 December 2004  the Reg Vardy Gallery at the University of Sunderland  UK  hosted an exhibition on the subject of micronational group identity and symbolism  The exhibition focused on numismatic  philatelic and vexillological artifacts  as well as other symbols and instruments created and used by a number of micronations from the 1950s through to the present day  A summit of micronations conducted as part of this exhibition was attended by representatives of Sealand  Elgaland Vargaland  New Utopia  Atlantium  Frestonia and Fusa  The exhibition was reprised at the Andrew Kreps Gallery in New York City from 24 June – 29 July of the following year and organized by R  Blackson and Peter Coffin  Peter Coffin organized a more extensive exhibition about micronations at Paris  Palais de Tokyo in early 2007 called ÉTATS  faites le vous même  States  Do it yourself    The Sunderland summit was later featured in the 5 part BBC light entertainment television series How to Start Your Own Country presented by Danny Wallace  The series told the story of Wallace s experience of founding a micronation  Lovely  located in his London flat  It screened in the UK in 2005   Similar programs have also aired on television networks in other parts of Europe  In France  several Canal+ programs have centered on the satirical Presipality of Groland  while in Belgium a series by Rob Vanoudenhoven and broadcast on the Flemish commercial network VTM in April 2006 was reminiscent of Wallace s series  and centred around the producer s creation of Robland  Among other things Vanoudenhoven minted his own coins denominated in  Robbies    On September 9  2006  The Guardian newspaper reported that the travel guide company Lonely Planet had published the world s first travel guide devoted to micronations  Micronations  The Lonely Planet Guide to Home Made Nations   The Democratic Empire of Sunda  which claims to be the Government of the Kingdom of Sunda  an ancient kingdom  in present day Indonesia  in exile in Switzerland  made media headlines when two so called princesses  Lamia Roro Wiranatadikusumah Siliwangi Al Misri  21  and Fathia Reza Wiranatadikusumah Siliwangi Al Misiri  23  were detained by Malaysian authorities at the border with Brunei  on 13 July 2007  and are charged for entering the country without a valid pass  The hearing continues   In 2010  a conference of micronations was held on Dangar Island in Sydney  Australia  Micronations with representatives in attendance included the Empire of Atlantium  the Principality of Hutt River  the Principality of Wy and the Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands  In 2010  a documentary film by Jody Shapiro entitled  How to Start your Own Country  was screened as part of the Toronto International Film Festival  The documentary explored various micronations around the world  and included an analysis of the concept of statehood and citizenship  Erwin Strauss  author of the eponymous book  was interviewed as part of the film   In 2012  a conference of micronations  Polination 2012  was held in London   Micronations with representatives in attendance included the Empire of Atlantium  the Republic of Molossia  the Grand Duchy of Flandrensis  Ladonia  Neue Slowenische Kunst and Austenasia   The manga and anime series Hetalia  Axis Powers  in which the main characters are the stereotyped personifications of the nations of the world  features several micronations as characters  As of 2011 micronations represented include Sealand  Seborga  Wy  Kugelmugel  Molossia  Hutt River  Ladonia  and the former micronation of Nikko Nikko   The Australian television comedy series  Micro Nation  is set on the fictional island micronation of Pullamawang  which remained independent from Australia because they  forgot to mail in their paperwork  at the Federation of Australia in 1901   7  Coins of micronations  File Seborga Coin   Prince JPG A Principality of Seborga coin File Minerva Republic JPG 35 Dollars  Republic of
