The Universal House of Justice    is the supreme governing institution of the Bahá í Faith  It is a legislative institution with the authority to supplement and apply the laws of Bahá u lláh  the founder of the Bahá í Faith  and exercises a judicial function as the highest appellate institution in the Bahá í administration  The institution was defined in the writings of Bahá u lláh and `Abdu l Bahá  Bahá u lláh s successor  and was officially established in 1963 as the culmination of the Ten Year Crusade  an international Bahá í teaching plan   Its nine members are elected every five years from the male membership in good standing of the world community by an electoral college consisting of all the members of each Bahá í National Spiritual Assembly throughout the world  The Seat of the Universal House of Justice and its members reside in Haifa  Israel  on the slope of Mount Carmel   While empowered to legislate on matters that are not explicitly stated in the Baha i holy writings  the Universal House of Justice has  since its inception  limited its exercise of this function  Instead it has generally provided guidance to Bahá ís around the world through letters and messages  The books and documents published by the Universal House of Justice are considered authoritative and its legislative decisions are considered infallible by Bahá ís  The institution has also collected and published extracts from the writings of the Báb  Bahá u lláh and `Abdu l Bahá   1  History  Bahá u lláh  the founder of the Bahá í Faith  in his the book considered his most holy by his adherents  the Kitáb i Aqdas  also known as his book of laws  first ordains the institution of the House of Justice and defines its functions  The institution s responsibilities are also expanded on and referred to in several other of Bahá u lláh s writings including in his Tablets of Bahá u lláh  In those writings Bahá u lláh writes that the Universal House of Justice would assume authority over the religion  and would consider matters that had not been covered by himself  he stated that the members of the institution would be assured of divine inspiration  and have the regard for all peoples and safe guard their honour   Later  `Abdu l Bahá  Bahá u lláh s son and successor  in his Will and Testament  elaborated on its functioning  its composition and outlined the method for its election  He wrote that the Universal House of Justice would be under Bahá u lláh s protection  that it would be freed of error  and that obedience to it would be obligatory  `Abdu l Bahá first used the term  Universal House of Justice  to distinguish the supreme body from those local  Houses of Justice  to be established in each community  and the secondary  Houses of Justice   current Bahá í national spiritual assemblies   He also stated that the institution s decisions could be by majority vote  but that unanimous decisions were preferred  and that it would be elected by the members of the secondary Houses of Justice  He also confirmed Bahá u lláh s statements that its membership would be confined to men  and that the reason behind this decision would become apparent in the future   While both `Abdu l Bahá and Shoghi Effendi  heads of the religion after Bahá u lláh  considered establishing the Universal House of Justice  they both declined to do so  Shoghi Effendi s reason was due to his belief in the weakness of the existing Bahá í institutions 舒 there were a very limited number of national spiritual assemblies and local spiritual assemblies  Thus during his lifetime  Shoghi Effendi prepared for the election of the Universal House of Justice  by establishing a strong administrative structure at the local and national levels  In 1951 when there were 9 national spiritual assemblies  Shoghi Effendi appointed members to the International Bahá í Council  and described it as an embryonic international House of Justice  After Shoghi Effendi s unexpected death in 1957  the Hands of the Cause directed the affairs of the religion and announced that the election of the Universal House of Justice would occur in 1963 at the end of the Ten Year Crusade  an international teaching plan instituted by Shoghi Effendi   In 1961 the International Bahá í Council was changed to an elected body  with members of all National Spiritual Assemblies voting for its members  Then in April 1963 the first Universal House of Justice was elected  six years after the passing of Shoghi Effendi  by 56 national spiritual assemblies  The date of the election coincided with the completion of the Ten Year Crusade and also with the first centenary anniversary of the public declaration of Bahá u lláh in the Garden of Ridván in April 1863  Since then the Universal House of Justice has acted as the head of the religion  in 1972 it published its constitution   2  Election process  The Universal House of Justice is elected through secret ballot and plurality vote in a three stage election by adult Bahá ís throughout the world  The House of Justice is elected without nominations or campaigning and all adult male members of the Bahá í Faith are eligible for election to the House  The body is elected every five years during a convention of the members of the various National or Regional Spiritual Assemblies  NSAs  across the world  Each member of the various NSAs  who were themselves elected by the Bahá ís of their country  votes for nine adult male Bahá ís  Absentee ballots are mailed or carried by delegates  The nine people who have the most votes are elected onto the Universal House of Justice  Women are not eligible for election to the Universal House of Justice  `Abdu l Bahá stated that the reason for this will become clear in the future  and that women and men are spiritually equal  For more on this issue see Bahá í Faith and gender equality   The most recent full election was on April 29  2013  when more than a thousand Bahá’ís from the National Spiritual Assemblies of 157 countries were present at the 11th International Bahá’í Convention at the Bahá í World Centre in Haifa  In addition to those present in Haifa  approximately 400 absentee ballots were cast  taking the total number of ballots cast to over 1500  This election marked the 50th anniversary of the first election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963   3  Responsibilities  The Universal House of Justice today guides the growth and development of the global Bahá í community  The general functions of the Universal Houses of Justice  as stated by Bahá u lláh include to promulgate the cause of God  to preserve the law  to administer social affairs  to educate the people s souls  to guarantee the education of children  to make the world prosperous  and to care of the elderly and the ill who are in poverty  According to its constitution  the Universal House of Justice itself states that  The provenance  the authority  the duties  the sphere of action of the Universal House of Justice all derive from the revealed Word of Bahá u lláh which  together with the interpretations and expositions of `Abdu l Bahá and of Shoghi Effendi     constitute the binding terms of reference of the Universal House of Justice and are its bedrock foundation   Some of the powers and duties according to the constitution include   Promoting the spiritual qualities that characterize Bahá í life individually and collectively  Preserving the Bahá í sacred texts  Defending and protecting the global Bahá í community from repression and persecution  Preserving and developing the world spiritual and administrative centre of the Bahá í Faith  Encouraging the growth and maturation of the Bahá í community and administration  Safeguarding individual personal rights  freedoms and initiatives  Applying Bahá í principles and laws  Developing  abrogating and changing laws that are not recorded in the Bahá í sacred texts  according to the requirements of the time  Pronouncing sanctions against violations of Bahá í law  Adjudicating and arbitrating of disputes referred to it  Administrating all religious funds and endowments such as Huqúqu lláh that are entrusted to its care Furthermore  the Universal House of Justice is instructed by Bahá u lláh to exert a positive influence on the general welfare of humankind  to promote a permanent peace among the nations of the world  ensure the  training of peoples  the up building of nations  the protection of man and the safeguarding of his honour   The Universal House of Justice is supported by the elected national and local governing bodies of the Bahá í Faith   the National Spiritual Assemblies and Local Spiritual Assemblies respectively   It has  furthermore  created several appointed institutions to support its work around the world  among these are the Continental Board of Counsellors and the International Teaching Centre   3 1  Jurisdiction  The Universal House of Justice is also given the responsibility of adapting the Bahá í Faith as society progresses  and is thus given the power to legislate on matters not explicitly covered in the Bahá í sacred texts  While the Universal House of Justice is authorized to change or repeal its own legislation as conditions change  it cannot dissolve or change any of the laws which are explicitly written in the sacred texts  Shoghi Effendi has written        the Universal House of Justice has been invested with the function of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the teachings     whose exclusive right and prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgement on such laws and ordinances as Bahá u lláh has not expressly revealed     Neither the Guardian of the Faith nor any institution apart from the International House of Justice can ever usurp this vital and essential power or encroach upon that sacred right   In the same book  Shoghi Effendi mentions that certain issues were left intentionally for the House of Justice to apply and legislate on as time progressed    Severed from the no less essential institution of the Universal House of Justice this same System of the Will of  Abdu l Bahá would be paralyzed in its action and would be powerless to fill in those gaps which the Author of the Kitáb i Aqdas has deliberately left in the body of His legislative and administrative ordinances    3 2  Infalibility  4  Publications  While being empowered to legislate on matters  the Universal House of Justice has  since its inception in 1963  been limited in its exercise of this function  Instead it has generally provided guidance to Bahá ís around the world  this guidance has generally been through the form of letters and messages  much like Shoghi Effendi s communications  Many of these letters have been published in compilations and are regarded as divinely empowered and authoritative  its legislative decisions are considered infallible to Bahá ís  The letters cover a range of subjects including teaching  prayer  family life  education and Bahá í administration  Each year on 21 April — the first day of Ridván — the Universal House of Justice addresses a message to the worldwide Bahá’í community  known as Ridván messages   The institution has also collected and published extracts from the writings of the Báb  Bahá u lláh and `Abdu l Bahá  In 1992 they published the Kitáb i Aqdas  Bahá u lláh s book of laws in English  and further translations have since been published  During these endeavours  they established departments of research and archives at the Bahá í World Centre  and  as of 1983  have collected over 60 000 letters of Bahá u lláh  `Abdu l Bahá and Shoghi Effendi  These collected works have been used as a base in the deliberations of the Universal House of Justice   The Promise of
