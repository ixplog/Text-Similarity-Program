The Economy of Poland is the sixth largest in the EU  and the largest among the ex communist members of the European Union  Before the late 2000s recession its economy grew a yearly growth rate of over 6 0%   According to the Central Statistical Office of Poland  in 2010 the Polish economic growth rate was 3 9%  which was one of the best results in Europe  In Q1 2014 its economy grew by 3 4% and is expected to grow by 3 4% in 2014  3 7% in 2015 and 3 9% in 2016   1  History  1 1  Before 1989  This article discusses the economy of the current Poland  post 1989  For historical overview of past Polish economies  see   Economy of the People s Republic of Poland  1945–1989   Economy of the Second Polish Republic  1918–1939   Economy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth  1569–1795   1 2  1990 2009  The Polish state has steadfastly pursued a policy of economic liberalization throughout the 1990s  with positive results for economic growth but negative results for some sectors of the population  The privatization of small and medium state owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms has encouraged the development of the private business sector  which has been the main drive for Poland s economic growth  The agricultural sector remains handicapped by structural problems  surplus labor  inefficient small farms  and a lack of investment  Restructuring and privatization of  sensitive sectors   e g  coal   has also been slow  but recent foreign investments in energy and steel have begun to turn the tide  Recent reforms in health care  education  the pension system  and state administration have resulted in larger than expected fiscal pressures  Improving this account deficit and tightening monetary policy  with focus on inflation  are priorities for the Polish government  Further progress in public finance depends mainly on the reduction of public sector employment  and an overhaul of the tax code to incorporate farmers  who currently pay significantly lower taxes than other people with similar income levels  Despite some continued systemic problems  Poland has made great economic progress over the last decade  and now is ranked 20th worldwide in terms of GDP  The largest component of its economy is the service sector  With the economic reform of 1989 the Polish external debt increased from $42 2 billion in 1989 to $365 2 billion in 2014  1 3  Since the 2009 financial crisis  Since the global recession of 2009  Poland s GDP continued to grow  In 2009  at the high point of the crisis  the GDP for the European Union as a whole dropped by 4 5% while Polish GDP increased by 1 6%  As of November 2013  the size of EU s economy remains below the pre crisis level  while Poland s economy increased by a cumulative 16%  The major reasons for its success appear to be a large internal market  in terms of population is sixth in EU  and a business friendly political climate  The economic reforms implemented after the fall of communism in the 1990s have also played a role  between 1989 and 2007 Poland s economy grew by 177%  faster than other countries in Eastern and Central Europe  while at the same time millions were left without work   Another factor which allowed the Polish economy to avoid the financial crisis was its low level of public debt  at about 50% of GDP  below the EU average  around 90%   Strict financial regulation also helped to keep household and corporate debt low  Furthermore  unlike many other European countries  Poland did not implement austerity but rather boosted domestic demand through Keynesian policy of tax cut  and foreign assistance funded public spending  An additional reason for its success lay in the fact that Poland is outside the Euro zone  The depreciation of the currency  the złoty  increased international competitiveness and boosted the value of Poland s exports  in złotys    However  the economic fluctuations of the business cycle did have an impact on Poland s unemployment rate  which by early 2013 reached almost 11%  This level was still below European average and has begun falling subsequently  A of February 2014  Poland s unemployment rate stood at 14% according to Polish Central Statistics Office and 9 7% according to Eurostat which stated European average is 10 6%  and 11 9% for the EU18   Unemployment remains a permanent and one of the most important problems of Poland and has been growing since years and Polish unemployment remains one of the highest in EU Warsaw Business Journal remarked that the fact that despite the growing GDP Polish unemployment remained  stubbornly high  casts shadow over claims of economic success  in 2012 the unemployment rate in Poland was 13 3 percent higher than it was in 1991  12 2  after capitalist reforms were initiated Entrenched structural unemployment is especially problematic in Poland  with 46% of the jobless being long term unemployed Lack of employment opportunities  low wages and poverty have led to flight of over 2 million Poles to Western EU in search of better life since 2004  with most being in the young demographic and not intending to return to Poland  this is expected to cause long term problems in Polish economy According to professor Gavin Rae from Kozminski University most of Polish recent economic growth was based on ability to leverage funding from EU  2  Labour market and wages  Despite Polish productivity rising to 2 3 of those in the West  the wages in Poland remained low  at 1 3 of that in the West  this has contributed to the flight of Polish population from the country   Poland has the highest number of workers in the EU employed on so called  junk contracts   i e  non fixed  temporary contracts  Whilst the average share in the EU is less than 15%  in Poland it exceeds 27%  This number has increased by more than five times since 2000  when only 5% of workers were employed on  junk contracts  and particularly affects the young population among whom over 60% of workers are employed on such conditions  this problem is exacerbated by the large number of people  19%  being forced to work as self employed Employers are not required to pay social insurance for these workers  meaning that they will receive the lowest level of pension upon their retirement  while also depriving the National Insurance Fund  ZUS  of funds needed  3  Foreign trade and FDI  With the collapse of the rouble based COMECON trading bloc in 1991  Poland reoriented its trade  As early as 1996  70% of its trade was with EU members  Neighboring Germany is Poland s main trading partner today  Poland joined the European Union in May 2004  Before that  it fostered regional integration and trade through the Central European Free Trade Agreement  CEFTA   which included Hungary  the Czech Republic  Slovakia and Slovenia   Poland is a founding member of the World Trade Organization  As member of the European Union  it applies the common external tariff to goods from other countries including the United States  Major Poland s imports are capital goods needed for industrial retooling and for manufacturing inputs  The country s exports also include machinery  but are highly diversified  The most successful exports are furniture  organic foods and meats  motor boats  light planes  hardwood products  casual clothing  shoes and cosmetics  Germany is by far the biggest importer of Poland s exports as of 2013  In the agricultural sector  the biggest money makers abroad include smoked and fresh fish  fine chocolate  and dairy products  meats and specialty breads  with the exchange rate conducive to export growth  Food exports amounted to 62 billion zloty in 2011  increasing by 17% from 2010  Most Polish exports to the U S  receive tariff benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences  GSP  program   Poland is less dependent on external trade than most other Central and Eastern European countries  but its volume of trade with Europe is still substantial  In 2011 the volume of trade  exports plus imports  with the Euro area as share of GDP was 40%  a doubling from the mid 1990s  30% of Poland s exports are to Germany and another 30% to the rest of Europe  There has been substantial increase in Poland s exports to Russia  However in August 2014  exports of fruits and vegetables to Russia fell dramatically following its politically motivated ban by Moscow   Foreign direct investment  FDI  was at 40% of GDP in 2010  a doubling over the level in 2000  Most FDI into Poland comes from France  Germany and Netherlands  Polish firms in turn have foreign investments primarily in Italy and Luxembourg  Most of the internal FDI is in manufacturing  which makes it susceptible to economic fluctuations in the source countries   The UAE has become Poland s largest trading partner in the Arab world  Roman Chalaczkiewicz  Polish Ambassador to the UAE  told Gulf News   Polish law is rather favourable to foreign entrepreneurs  The government offers investors various forms of state aid  such as  CIT tax at the level of 19% and investment incentives in 14 Special Economic Zones  among others  income tax exemption  real estate tax exemption  competitive land prices   several industrial and technology parks  the possibility to benefit from the EU structural funds  brownfield and greenfield locations  According to the National Bank of Poland  NBP  the level of FDI inflow into Poland in 2006 amounted to €13 9 billion   According to an Ernst & Young report  Poland ranks 7th in the World in terms of investment attractiveness  However  Ernst & Young s 2010 European attractiveness survey reported that Poland saw a 52% decrease in FDI job creation and a 42% decrease in number of FDI projects since 2008  According to the OECD  www oecd org  report  in 2004 Poles were one of the hardest working nations in Europe  Yet  the ability to establish and conduct business easily has been cause for economic hardship  the 2010 the World Economic Forum ranked Poland near the bottom of OECD countries in terms of the clarity  efficiency and neutrality of the legal framework used by firms to settle disputes   4  Sectors  4 1  Primary  4 1 1  Agriculture  Agriculture employs 12 7% of the work force but contributes 3 8% to the gross domestic product  GDP   reflecting relatively low productivity  Unlike the industrial sector  Poland s agricultural sector remained largely in private hands during the decades of communist rule  Most of the former state farms are now leased to farmer tenants  Lack of credit is hampering efforts to sell former state farmland  Currently  Poland s 2 million private farms occupy 90% of all farmland and account for roughly the same percentage of total agricultural production  Farms are small—8 hectares on average—and often fragmented  Farms with an area exceeding 15 ha accounted for 9% of the total number of farms but cover 45% of total agricultural area  Over half of all farm households in Poland produce only for their own needs with little  if any  commercial sales   Poland is a net exporter of processed fruit and vegetables  meat  and dairy products  Processors often rely on imports to supplement domestic supplies of wheat  feed grains  vegetable oil  and protein meals  which are generally insufficient to meet domestic demand  However  Poland is the leading EU producer of potatoes and rye and is one of the world s largest producers of sugar beets and triticale  Poland also is a significant producer of rapeseed  grains  hogs  and cattle  Poland is the largest producer and exporter of apples in the entire world  surpassing China   4 1 2  Mining  Historically  mining industry in Poland had been extensive  particularly in Silesia   4 2  Secondary  4 2 1  Production industries  Before World War II  Poland s industrial base was concentrated in the coal  textile  chemical  machinery  iron  and steel sectors  Today it extends to fertilizers  petrochemicals  machine tools  electrical machinery  electronics  car manufacture and shipbuilding   Poland s industrial base suffered greatly during World War II  and many resources were directed toward reconstruction  The socialist economic system imposed in the late 1940s created large and unwieldy economic structures operated under a tight central command  In part because of this systemic rigidity  the economy performed poorly even in comparison with other economies in Central Europe   In 1990  the Mazowiecki government began a comprehensive reform programme to replace the centralised command economy with a market oriented system  While the results overall have been impressive  many large state owned industrial enterprises  particularly the rail  mining  steel  and defence sectors  have remained resistant to change and the downsizing required to survive in a market based economy   4 2 1 1  Energy  4 2 1 2  Pharmaceutics  The total value of the Polish pharmacy market in 2008 was PLN 24 1bn  11 5% more than in 2007   The non prescription medicines market  which accounts for about one third of the total market value  was worth PLN 7 5bn in 2008  This value includes drugs and non drugs such as dietary supplements  cosmetics  dressings  dental materials  diagnostic tests and medical devices  The prescription medicines market was worth PLN 15 8bn   4 3  Tertiary  4 3 1  Financial  The Polish banking sector is regulated by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority  PFSA    While transforming the country to a market oriented economy during 1992–97  the government privatized some banks  recapitalized the rest and introduced legal reforms that made the sector competitive  These reforms  and the health and relative stability of the sector  attracted a number of strategic foreign investors  At the beginning of 2009  Poland s banking sector had 51 domestic banks  a network of 578 cooperative banks and 18 branches of foreign owned banks  In addition  foreign investors had controlling stakes in nearly 40 commercial banks  which made up 68% of the banking capital  Banks in Poland reacted to the financial crisis of 2009 by restraining lending  raising interest rates  and strengthening balance sheets  Subsequently  the sector started lending again  with an increase of more than 4% expected in 2011   5  Major Polish companies
