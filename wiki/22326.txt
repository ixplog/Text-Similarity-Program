The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible  based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible  a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites  It is the counterpart to the New Testament  the Christian Bible s second section  The Old Testament canon varies between Christian denominations  Protestants accept only the books found in the canon of the Hebrew Bible  dividing them into 39 books  while Catholic  Eastern Orthodox  and Oriental Orthodox churches accept somewhat larger collections of writings   The Old Testament consists of many distinct books written  compiled  and edited by various authors over a period of centuries  It is not entirely clear at what point the parameters of the Hebrew Bible  the basis for the Christian Old Testament  were fixed  Some scholars have opined that the canon of the Hebrew Bible was established already by about the 3rd century BC  The development of the various forms of the Christian Old Testament  at any rate  continued for centuries   The books of the Old Testament can be broadly divided into several sections  1  the first five books or Pentateuch  Torah   2  the history books telling the history of the Israelites  from their conquest of Canaan to their defeat and exile in Babylon  3  the poetic and  Wisdom  books dealing  in various forms  with questions of good and evil in the world  4  and the books of the biblical prophets  warning of the consequences of turning away from God   1  Content  The Old Testament contains 39  Protestant  or 46  Catholic  or more  Orthodox and other  books  divided  very broadly  into the Pentateuch  Torah   the historical books  the  wisdom  books and the prophets   1 1  Table  The table uses the spellings and names present in modern editions of the Bible  such as the New American Bible Revised Edition  Revised Standard Version and English Standard Version  The spelling and names in both the 1609–10 Douay Old Testament  and in the 1582 Rheims New Testament  and the 1749 revision by Bishop Challoner  the edition currently in print used by many Catholics  and the source of traditional Catholic spellings in English  and in the Septuagint differ from those spellings and names used in modern editions which are derived from the Hebrew Masoretic text   For the Orthodox canon  Septuagint titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions  For the Catholic canon  the Douaic titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions  Likewise  the King James Version references some of these books by the traditional spelling when referring to them in the New Testament  such as  Esaias   for Isaiah    In the spirit of ecumenism more recent Catholic translations  e g  the New American Bible  Jerusalem Bible  and ecumenical translations used by Catholics  such as the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition  use the same  standardized   King James Version  spellings and names as Protestant Bibles  e g  1 Chronicles as opposed to the Douaic 1 Paralipomenon  1–2 Samuel and 1–2 Kings instead of 1–4 Kings  in those books which are universally considered canonical  the protocanonicals   The Talmud  the Jewish commentary on the scriptures  in Bava Batra 14b gives a different order for the books in Nevi im and Ketuvim  This order is also cited in Mishneh Torah Hilchot Sefer Torah 7 15  The order of the books of the Torah are universal through all denominations of Judaism and Christianity   The disputed books  included in one canon but not in others  are often called the Biblical apocrypha  a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canons that are absent from the Jewish Masoretic Text and most modern Protestant Bibles  Catholics  following the Canon of Trent  1546   describe these books as deuterocanonical  while Greek Orthodox Christians  following the Synod of Jerusalem  1672   use the traditional name of anagignoskomena  meaning  that which is to be read   They are present in a few historic Protestant versions  the German Luther Bible included such books  as did the English 1611 King James Version   Empty table cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon   Several of the books in the Eastern Orthodox canon are also found in the appendix to the Latin Vulgate  formerly the official Bible of the Roman Catholic Church   2  Composition  The first five books – Genesis  Exodus  Leviticus  book of Numbers and Deuteronomy – comprise the Torah  the story of Israel from the Genesis creation narrative to the death of Moses  Few scholars today doubt that it reached its present form in the Persian period  538–332 BC   and that its authors were the elite of exilic returnees who controlled the Temple at that time   The books of Joshua  Judges  Samuel and Kings follow  forming a history of Israel from the Conquest of Canaan to the Siege of Jerusalem c  587 BC  There is a broad consensus among scholars that these originated as a single work  the so called  Deuteronomistic history   during the Babylonian exile of the 6th century BC  The two Books of Chronicles cover much the same material as the Pentateuch and Deuteronomistic history and probably date from the 4th century BC   Chronicles links with the books of Ezra and Nehemiah  which were probably finished during the 3rd century BC  Catholic and Orthodox Old Testaments contain two  Catholic Old Testament  to four  Orthodox  Books of Maccabees  written in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC   The history books make up around half the total content of the Old Testament  Of the remainder  the books of the various prophets – Isaiah  Jeremiah  Ezekiel  Daniel and the twelve  minor prophets  – were written between the 8th and 6th centuries BC  with the exceptions of Jonah and Daniel  which were written much later  The  wisdom  and other books – Job  Proverbs and so on – date from between the 5th century BC and the 2nd or 1st BC  with the exception of some of the Psalms   3  Themes  God is consistently depicted as the one who created or put into order the world and guides its history  Although he is not consistently presented as the only god who exists  he is always depicted as the only god whom Israel is to worship  and both Jews and Christians have always interpreted the bible as an affirmation of the oneness of God   The Old Testament stresses the special relationship between God and his chosen people  Israel  but includes instructions for proselytes as well  This relationship is expressed in the biblical covenant  contract  between the two  received by Moses  The law codes in books such as Exodus and especially Deuteronomy are the terms of the contract  Israel swears faithfulness to Yahweh  and God swears to be Israel s special protector and supporter   Further themes in the Old Testament include salvation  redemption  divine judgment  obedience and disobedience  faith and faithfulness  among others  Throughout there is a strong emphasis on ethics and ritual purity  both of which God demands  although some of the prophets and wisdom writers seem to question this  arguing that God demands social justice above purity  and perhaps does not even care about purity at all  The Old Testament s moral code enjoins fairness  intervention on behalf of the vulnerable  and the duty of those in power to administer justice righteously  It forbids murder  bribery and corruption  deceitful trading  and many sexual misdemeanors  All morality is traced back to God  who is the source of all goodness   The problem of evil plays a large part in the Old Testament  The problem the Old Testament authors faced was that a good God must have had just reason for bringing disaster  meaning notably  but not only  the Babylonian exile  upon his people  The theme is played out  with many variations  in books as different as the histories of Kings and Chronicles  the prophets like Ezekiel and Jeremiah  and in the wisdom books like Job and Ecclesiastes   4  From scripture to canon  formation of the Old Testament  4 1  Greek  Latin and Protestant Old Testaments  The process by which scriptures became canons and Bibles was a long one  and its complexities account for the many different Old Testaments which exist today  Timothy H  Lim  a professor of Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism at the University of Edinburgh  states that   The Old Testament  OT  or Tanak was written in Hebrew and Aramaic  This collection of books was not written by one man  nor did it drop down from heaven as assumed by fundamentalists  It is not a magical book  but a collection of authoritative texts of apparently divine origin that went through a human process of writing and editing ” By about the 5th century BC Jews saw the five books of the Torah  the Old Testament Pentateuch  as having authoritative status  by the 2nd century BC the Prophets had a similar status  although without quite the same level of respect as the Torah  beyond that  the Jewish scriptures were fluid  with different groups seeing authority in different books   4 1 1  Greek Bible  The scriptures were first translated into Greek in Alexandria between about 280130 BC  These early Greek translations supposedly commissioned by Ptolemy Philadelphus were called the Septuagint  Latin   Seventy   from the supposed number of translators involved  hence its abbreviation  LXX    This Septuagint remains the basis of the Old Testament in the Eastern Orthodox Church   It varies in many places from the Masoretic Text and includes numerous books no longer considered canonical in other traditions  1st and 2nd Esdras  Judith  Tobit  3rd and 4th Maccabees  the Book of Wisdom  Sirach  and Baruch  Early modern Biblical criticism typically explained these variations as intentional or ignorant corruptions by the Alexandrian scholars  but most recent scholarship holds it is simply based on early source texts differing from those later used by the Masoretes in their work   The Septuagint was originally used by Jews so thoroughly Hellenized that their knowledge of Greek was better than their Hebrew  The ever increasing number of gentile converts to Christianity created a growing need for translations of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek and Latin  The three most acclaimed early interpreters were Aquila of Sinope  Symmachus the Ebionite  and Theodotion  in his Hexapla  Origen placed his edition of the Hebrew text beside its transcription in Greek letters and four parallel translations  Aquila s  Symmachus s  the Septuagint s  and Theodotion s  The so called  fifth  and  sixth editions  were two other Greek translations supposedly miraculously discovered by students outside the towns of Jericho and Nicopolis  these were added to Origen s Octapla   In 331  Constantine I commissioned Eusebius to deliver fifty Bibles for the Church of Constantinople  Athanasius recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for Constans  Little else is known  though there is plenty of speculation  For example  it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists  and that Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus are examples of these Bibles  Together with the Peshitta and Codex Alexandrinus  these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles  There is no evidence among the canons of the First Council of Nicaea of any determination on the canon  however  Jerome  347–420   in his Prologue to Judith  makes the claim that the Book of Judith was  found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures    4 1 2  Latin Bible  In Western Christianity or Christianity in the Western half of the Roman Empire  Latin had displaced Greek as the common language of the early Christians  and about 400 AD Pope Damasus I commissioned Jerome  the leading scholar of the day  to produce an updated Latin bible to replace the Vetus Latina  Sometime in the centuries after the Septuagint  exactly when is disputed  the Rabbis  Jewish religious scholars and teachers  defined the Jewish canon  which is a much shorter canon of only 24 books  and Jerome used it  commonly called the Hebrew Bible  instead of the Greek Old Testament as the basis for his translation  citing  Hebraica Veritas   Latin  Truth of the Hebrew   His Vulgate  i e  common language  Old Testament became the standard bible used in the Western Church  specifically as the Sixto Clementine Vulgate  while the Churches in the East continued  and still continue  to use the Septuagint   Jerome had wanted to drop all the books that did not appear in the Hebrew Bible  but St Augustine  a bishop and another great scholar of the day  opposed him and won the argument  notably at the Council of Carthage on 28 August 397  In the 16th century the Protestant reformers reopened the debate  and sided with Jerome  but only for their own congregations  yet although Protestant Bibles now have only those books that appear in the Jewish Bible  they have them in the order of the Greek Bible   Rome  largely in reaction to this attack on tradition  officially adopted a canon  the Canon of Trent  which can be seen as following Augustine s Carthaginian Councils or the Council of Rome  and includes most  but not all  of the Septuagint  3 Ezra and 3 and 4 Maccabees are excluded   the Anglicans after the English Civil War adopted a compromise position  restoring the 39 Articles and keeping the extra books that were excluded by the Westminster Confession of Faith  but only for private study and for reading in churches  while Lutherans kept them for private study  gathered in an appendix as Biblical Apocrypha   4 2  Other versions  While the Hebrew  Greek and Latin versions of the Hebrew Bible are the best known Old Testaments  there were others  At much the same time as the Septuagint was being produced  translations were being made into Aramaic  the language of Jews living in Palestine and the Near East and likely the language of Jesus  these are called the Aramaic Targums  from a word meaning  translation   and were used to help Jewish congregations understand their scriptures   For Aramaic Christians there was a Syriac translation of the Hebrew Bible called the Peshitta  as well as versions in Coptic  the everyday language of Egypt in the first Christian centuries  descended from ancient Egyptian   Ethiopic  for use in the Ethiopian church  one of the oldest Christian churches   Armenian  Armenia was the first to adopt Christianity as its official religion   and Arabic   5  Literary evaluations  The Old Testament is considered one of the most important and influential works of literature in world literature  and has provided inspiration for writers  both religious and secular  throughout subsequent history  In 1886  Friedrich Nietzsche wrote   In the Jewish Old Testament  there are men  things and speeches in so grand a style that Greek and Indian literature have nothing to compare to it  One stands with awe and reverence before these tremendous remnants of what man once was    The taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone of  greatness  and  smallness   To have glued this New Testament  a kind of rococo of taste in every respect  to the Old Testament to form one book    that is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the spirit that Europe has on its conscience   6  Christian theology and the Old Testament  Christianity is based on the claim that the historical Jesus is also the Christ  as in the Confession of Peter  This claim is in turn based on Jewish understandings of the meaning of the Hebrew term messiah  which  like the Greek  Christ   means  anointed   In the Hebrew Scriptures it describes a king anointed with oil on his accession to the throne  he becomes  The  s anointed  or Yahweh s Anointed  By the time of Jesus  some Jews expected that a flesh and blood descendant of David  the  Son of David   would come to establish a real Jewish kingdom in Jerusalem  instead of the Roman province   Others stressed the Son of Man  a distinctly other worldly figure who would appear as a judge at the end of time  and some harmonised the two by expecting a this worldly messianic kingdom which would last for a set period and be followed by the other worldly age or World to Come  Some thought the Messiah was already present  but unrecognised due to Israel s sins  some thought that the Messiah would be announced by a fore runner  probably Elijah  as promised by the prophet Malachi  whose book now ends the Old Testament and precedes Mark s account of John the Baptist   None predicted a Messiah who suffers and dies for the sins of all the people  The story of Jesus  death therefore involved a profound shift in meaning from the tradition of the Old Testament   The name  Old Testament  reflects Christianity s understanding of itself as the fulfillment of Jeremiah s prophesy of a New Covenant  which is similar to  testament  and often conflated  to replace the existing covenant between God and Israel  Jeremiah 31 31   The emphasis  however  has shifted from Judaism s understanding of the covenant as an eternal contract between God and Israel to one between God and those who are  in Christ    7  See also  Abrogation of Old Covenant laws  Biblical
