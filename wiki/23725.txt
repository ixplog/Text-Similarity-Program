sure I was safe  I got so mad I took out my glass eye  handed it to him and said   Try this   I got such a laugh you wouldn t believe    Falk s first stage appearance was at the age of 12 in The

Merchant Marine  and served as a cook and mess boy  Falk said of the experience in 1997   There they don t care if you re blind or not  The only one on a ship who has to see is the captain  And in the case of the Titanic  he couldn t see very well  either   Falk recalls this period in his autobiography   A year on the water was enough for me  so I returned to college  I didn t stay long  Too itchy  What to do next  I signed up to go to Israel to fight in the war on it s attack on Egypt  I wasn t passionate about Israel  I wasn t passionate about Egypt  I just wanted more excitement… I got assigned a ship and departure date but the war was over before the ship ever sailed    After a year and a half in the Merchant Marine  Falk returned to Hamilton College and also attended the

designed to train civil servants for the federal government  a career that Falk said in his memoir he had  no interest in and no aptitude for   He applied for a job with the CIA  but was rejected because of his membership in the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union while serving in the Merchant Marine  even though he was required to join and was not active in the union  which had been under fire for communist leanings   He then became a management analyst with the Connecticut State Budget Bureau in Hartford  In 1997  Falk characterized his Hartford job as  efficiency expert    I was such an efficiency expert that the first morning on the job  I couldn t find the building where I was to report for work  Naturally  I was late  which I always was in those days  but ironically it was my tendency never to be on time that got me started as a professional actor    2  Career  2 1  Stage career  While working in Hartford  Falk joined a community theater group called the Mark Twain Masquers  where he performed in plays that included The Caine Mutiny Court Martial  The Crucible  and The Country Girl by Clifford Odets  Falk also studied with Eva Le Gallienne  who was giving an acting class at the White Barn Theatre in Westport  Connecticut  Falk later recalled how he  lied his way  into the class  which was for professional actors  He drove down to Westport from Hartford every Wednesday  when the classes were held  and was usually late  In his 1997 interview with Arthur Marx in Cigar Aficionado Magazine  Falk said of Le Gallienne   One evening when I arrived late  she looked at me and asked   Young man  why are you always late   and I said   I have to drive down from Hartford    She looked down her nose and said   What do you do in Hartford  There s no theater there  How do you make a living acting   Falk confessed he wasn t a professional actor  According to him Le Gallienne looked at him sternly and said   Well  you should be   He drove back to Hartford

As the year came to an end  he appeared again on Broadway as an English soldier in Shaw s Saint Joan with Siobhán McKenna   In 1972  Falk appeared in Broadway s The Prisoner of Second Avenue  According to film historian Ephraim Katz   His characters derive added authenticity from his squinty gaze  the result of the loss of an eye       2 2  Early films  Despite his stage success  a theatrical agent advised Falk not to expect much film acting work because of his artificial eye  He failed a screen test at Columbia Pictures and was told by studio boss Harry Cohn   For the same

roles in Wind Across the Everglades  1958   The Bloody Brood  1959  and Pretty Boy Floyd  1960   Falk s performance in Murder  Inc   1960  was a turning point in his career  He was cast in the supporting role of killer Abe Reles in a film based on the real life murder gang of that name that terrorized New York in the 1930s  The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther while dismissing the movie as  an average gangster film  singled out Falk s  amusingly vicious performance   Crowther wrote   The film turned out to be Falk s breakout role  In his autobiography  Just One More Thing  2006   Falk said his selection for the film from thousands of other Off Broadway actors was a  miracle  that  made my career  and that without it  he would not have gotten the other significant movie roles that he later played  Falk  who played Reles again in the 1960 TV series The Witness  was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance in the film   In 1961  multiple Academy Award winning director Frank Capra cast Falk in the comedy Pocketful of Miracles  The film was Capra s last feature  and although it was not the commercial success he hoped it would be  he  gushed about Falk s performance   Falk was nominated for an Oscar for the role  In his autobiography  Capra wrote about Falk   For his part  Falk says he  never worked with a director who showed greater enjoyment of actors and the acting craft  There is nothing more important to an actor than to know that the one person who represents the audience to you  the director  is responding well to what you are trying to do   Falk recalled one time how Capra reshot a scene even though he yelled  Cut and Print   indicating the scene was finalized  When Falk asked him why he wanted it reshot   He laughed and said that he loved the scene so much he just wanted to see us do it again  How s that for support    For the remainder of the 1960s  Falk had mainly small movie roles and TV guest starring

after a tortuous cat and mouse investigation   He also noted the idea for the character was   Apparently inspired by Dostoyevsky s dogged police inspector  Porfiry Petrovich  in the novel Crime and Punishment   Falk tries to analyze the character and notes the correlation between his own personality and Columbo s   With  general amazement   Falk notes   The show is all over the world  I ve been to little villages in Africa with maybe one TV set  and little kids will run up to me shouting   Columbo  Columbo    Singer Johnny Cash recalled acting in one episode  and although he was not an
