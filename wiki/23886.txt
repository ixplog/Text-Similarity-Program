The phlogiston theory is an obsolete scientific theory that postulated a fire like element called phlogiston  contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion  The name comes from the Ancient Greek φλογιστόν phlogistón  burning up   from φλόξ phlóx  flame   It was first stated in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher  The theory attempted to explain burning processes such as combustion and rusting  which are now collectively known as oxidation   1  Theory  Phlogisticated substances are substances that contain phlogiston and dephlogisticate when burned   In general  substances that burned in air were said to be rich in phlogiston  the fact that combustion soon ceased in an enclosed space was taken as clear cut evidence that air had the capacity to absorb only a finite amount of phlogiston  When air had become completely phlogisticated it would no longer serve to support combustion of any material  nor would a metal heated in it yield a calx  nor could phlogisticated air support life  Breathing was thought to take phlogiston out of the body  Thus  Becher described phlogiston as a process that explained combustion through a process that was opposite to that of oxygen   Joseph Black s student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen in 1772 and the pair used the theory to explain his results  The residue of air left after burning  in fact a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide  was sometimes referred to as phlogisticated air  having taken up all of the phlogiston  Conversely  when oxygen was first discovered  it was thought to be dephlogisticated air  capable of combining with more phlogiston and thus supporting combustion for longer than ordinary air   2  History of the theory  In 1667  Johann Joachim Becher published his book Physical Education  which was the first mention of what would become the phlogiston theory  Traditionally  alchemists considered that there were four classical elements  fire  water  air  and earth  In his book  Becher eliminated fire and air from the classical element model and replaced them with three forms of earth  terra lapidea  terra fluida  and terra pinguis  Terra pinguis was the element that imparted oily  sulphurous  or combustible properties  Becher believed that terra pinguis was a key feature of combustion and was released when combustible substances were burned  In 1703 Georg Ernst Stahl  professor of medicine and chemistry at Halle  proposed a variant of the theory in which he renamed Becher s terra pinguis to phlogiston  and it was in this form that the theory probably had its greatest influence   3  Challenge and demise  Eventually  quantitative experiments revealed problems  including the fact that some metals  such as magnesium  gained mass when they burned  even though they were supposed to have lost phlogiston  Some phlogiston proponents explained this by concluding that phlogiston had negative mass  others  such as Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau  gave the more conventional argument that it was lighter than air  However  a more detailed analysis based on the Archimedean principle and the densities of magnesium and its combustion product shows that just being lighter than air cannot account for the increase in mass   During the eighteenth century  as it became clear that metals gained mass when they were oxidized  phlogiston was increasingly regarded as a principle rather than a material substance  By the end of the eighteenth century  for the few chemists who still used the term phlogiston  the concept was linked to hydrogen  Joseph Priestley  for example  in referring to the reaction of steam on iron  whilst fully acknowledging that the iron gains mass as it binds with oxygen to form a calx  iron oxide  iron also loses “the basis of inflammable air  hydrogen   and this is the substance or principle  to which we give the name phlogiston ” Following Lavoisier’s description of oxygen as the oxidizing principle  hence its name  from Ancient Greek  oksús  “sharp”  génos  “birth”  referring to oxygen s role in the formation of acids    Priestley described phlogiston as the alkaline principle   Phlogiston remained the dominant theory until the 1780s when Antoine Laurent Lavoisier showed that combustion requires a gas that has mass  oxygen  and could be measured by means of weighing closed vessels  The use of closed vessels also negated the buoyancy that had disguised the mass of the gases of combustion  These observations solved the mass paradox and set the stage for the new caloric theory of combustion   4  Enduring aspects  Phlogiston theory permitted chemists to bring clarification of apparently different phenomena into a coherent structure  combustion  metabolism  and configuration of rust  The recognition of the relation between combustion and metabolism was a forerunner of the recognition that the metabolism of living organisms and combustion can be understood in terms of fundamentally related chemical processes   5  Notes
