Mabo v Queensland  No  2   commonly known as Mabo  was a landmark High Court of Australia decision recognising native title in Australia for the first time  The High Court rejected the doctrine of terra nullius  in favour of the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title  and overruled Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd  1971   a contrary decision of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory   1  The case  The action which brought about the decision had been led by Eddie Mabo  David Passi and James Rice  all from the Meriam people  from the Murray islands in the Torres Strait   They commenced proceedings in the High Court in 1982  in response to the Queensland Amendment Act 1982 establishing a system of making land grants on trust for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders  which the Murray Islanders refused to accept  The Plaintiffs were represented by Ron Castan  Bryan Keon Cohen and Greg McIntyre   The action was brought as a test case to determine the legal rights of the Meriam people to land on the islands of Mer  Dauar and Waier in the Torres Strait  which were annexed to the state of Queensland in 1879  Prior to British contact the Meriam people had lived on the islands in a subsistence economy based on cultivation and fishing  Land on the islands was not subject of public or general community ownership  but was regarded as belonging to individuals or groups   In 1985 the Queensland Government attempted to terminate the proceedings by enacting the Queensland Coast Islands Declaratory Act 1985  which declared that on annexation of the islands in 1879  title to the islands was vested in the state of Queensland  freed from all other rights  interests and claims whatsoever   In Mabo v Queensland  No 1   1988  the High Court held that this legislation was contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975   The plaintiffs sought declarations  inter alia  that the Meriam people were entitled to the Murray Islands  as owners  as possessors  as occupiers  or as persons entitled to use and enjoy the said islands    Plaintiff s arguments  The plaintiff argued for a possessory title by reason of long possession   Defendant s arguments  The Queensland government argued that when the territory of a settled colony became part of the Crown s dominions  the law of England became the law of the colony and  by that law  the Crown acquired the  absolute beneficial ownership  of all land in the territory   2  The decision  Five judgments were delivered in the High Court  by  1  Justice Brennan   2  Justice Deane and Justice Gaudron   3  Justice Toohey   4  Justice Dawson  and  5  Chief Justice Mason and Justice McHugh   The decision was based on the findings of fact made by Justice Moynihan of the Supreme Court of Queensland  that the Murray Islanders had a strong sense of relationship to the islands and regarded the land as theirs  All of the judges  except Justice Dawson  agreed that   there was a concept of native title at common law   the source of native title was the traditional connection to or occupation of the land   the nature and content of native title was determined by the character of the connection or occupation under traditional laws or customs  and  native title could be extinguished by the valid exercise of governmental powers provided a clear and plain intention to do so was manifest   Rejection of terra nullius  The decision recognised that the indigenous population had a pre existing system of law  which  along with all rights subsisting thereunder  would remain in force under the new sovereign except where specifically modified or extinguished by legislative or executive action  The Court purported to achieve all this without altering the traditional assumption that the Australian land mass was  settled   Instead  the rules for a  settled  colony were said to be assimilated to the rules for a  conquered  colony   Repudiation of absolute beneficial title of all lands  The majority in Mabo also rejected the proposition that immediately upon the acquisition of sovereignty  absolute beneficial ownership of all the lands of the Colony vested in the Crown  The majority rejected the traditional feudal development of the doctrine of tenure as inappropriate for Australia  and rather saw that upon acquisition of sovereignty the Crown acquired not an absolute but a radical title  and that title would be subject to native title rights where those rights had not been validly extinguished  Thus the court accepted that a modified doctrine of tenure operated in Australia  and that the law of tenure  as a product of the common law  could co exist with the law of native title  as a product of customary laws and traditions   though where there had been a valid grant of fee simple by the Crown the latter title would be extinguished   Fragmentation of proprietary interests  Justice Toohey made the argument that common law possessory title could form the basis for native title claims by indigenous Australians  This has not subsequently been pursued   3  Consequences  The Mabo decision presented many legal and political questions  including   the validity of titles issued after the commencement of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975   the permissibility of future development of land affected by native title   the procedures for the large scale determination of issues of native title  In response to the judgment  the Parliament of Australia  controlled by the Labor Party led by Prime Minister Paul Keating  enacted the Native Title Act 1993  NTA   The NTA established the National Native Title Tribunal  NTTA  to make native title determinations in the first instance  appealable to the Federal Court of Australia  and thereafter the High Court  Following Wik Peoples v Queensland  1996   Parliament amended the NTA with the Native Title Amendment Act 1998   4  Popular culture  A straight to TV film titled Mabo was produced in 2012 by Blackfella Films in association with the ABC and SBS  It provided a dramatised account of the case  focussing on the effect it had on Mabo and his family   The case was also referenced as background to the plot in the 1997 comedy
