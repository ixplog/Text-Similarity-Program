The economy of Panama is a fully dollarized free market economy with a history of low inflation  It is based mainly on the services industry  heavily weighted toward banking  commerce  and tourism  The hand over of the canal and military installations by the US has given rise to new construction projects   Panama s economy is based primarily on a well developed services sector that accounts for nearly 80% of its GDP  Services include the Panama Canal  banking  the Colón Free Trade Zone  insurance  container ports  and flagship registry  medical and health  and other business  The country s industry includes  manufacturing of aircraft spare parts  cements  drinks  adhesives  and textiles  Also the leading exports for Panama are bananas  shrimp  sugar  coffee  and clothing   1  Statistics  Nominal GDP per capita in Panama was  in million of balboas or US dollars  11 691 in 2002  13 099 in 2004  14 004 in 2005  Prelim   15 141 9 in 2006  est   as reported by Office of Statistics and Census  Government of Panama  Growth from 2002 to 2006 was especially strong in the transport and communications sector  which became the biggest component of GDP  although many sectors also saw strong growth  Real GDP rose 7 5%  03 04   6 9%  04 05   8 1%  05 06    GDP growth in 2008 was 9 2%  reflecting a slowing of the robust growth of 11 5% seen in 2007  Although growth slowed to 2 4% in the first half of 2009  due to the global economic downturn  it is expected to improve in 2010 and is still one of the most positive growth rates in the region  Growth has been fueled by the construction sector  transportation  port and Panama Canal related activities  and tourism  As a result of this growth  government deficit as a percentage of GDP dropped to 43% in 2009  and government issued debt achieved investment grade in February 2010  A recent United Nations report highlighted progress in poverty reduction from 2001 to 2007—overall poverty fell from 37% to 29%  and extreme poverty fell from 19% to 12%  However  Panama still has the second most unequal income distribution in Latin America   2  Economic history  Since the early 16th century  Panamanians have relied on the country s comparative advantage—its geography  Exploitation of this advantage began soon after the Spanish arrived  when the conquistadors used Panama to transport gold and silver from Peru to Spain  Ports on each coast and a trail between them handled much of Spain s colonial trade from which the inhabitants of the port cities prospered  This was the beginning of the country s historical dependence on world commerce for prosperity and imports  Agriculture received little attention until the twentieth century  and by the 1980s had—for much of the population—barely developed beyond indigenous Indian techniques  Industry developed slowly because the flow of goods from Europe and later from North America created a disincentive for local production   Panama has been affected by the cyclical nature of international trade  The economy stagnated in the 18th century as colonial exchange via the isthmus declined  In the mid 19th century  Panama s economy boomed as a result of increased cargo and passengers associated with the California gold rush  A railroad across the isthmus  completed in 1855  prolonged economic growth for about fifteen years until completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States caused trans isthmian traffic to decline  France s efforts to construct a canal across the isthmus in the 1880s and efforts by the United States in the early 20th century stimulated the Panamanian economy  In 1903 Panama separated from Colombia and the US took control of the Panama Canal Zone  soon afterwards a constitutional ruling adopted the US dollar as legal tender for the whole country   The United States completed the canal in 1914  and canal traffic expanded by an average of 15 percent a year between 1915 and 1930  The stimulus was strongly felt in Panama City and Colón  the terminal cities of the canal  The world depression of the 1930s reduced international trade and canal traffic  however  causing extensive unemployment in the terminal cities and generating a flow of workers to subsistence farming  During World War II  canal traffic did not increase  but the economy boomed as the convoy system and the presence of United States forces  sent to defend the canal  increased foreign spending in the canal cities  The end of the war was followed by an economic depression and another exodus of unemployed people into agriculture  The government initiated a modest public works program  instituted price supports for major crops  and increased protection for selected agricultural and industrial products   The postwar depression gave way to rapid economic expansion between 1950 and 1970  when GDP increased by an average of 6 4 percent a year  one of the highest sustained growth rates in the world  All sectors contributed to the growth  Agricultural output rose  boosted by greater fishing activities  especially shrimp   the development of high value fruit and vegetable production  and the rapid growth of banana exports after disease resistant trees were planted  Commerce evolved into a relatively sophisticated wholesale and retail system  Banking  tourism  and the export of services to the Canal Zone grew rapidly  Most importantly  an increase in world trade provided a major stimulus to use of the canal and to the economy   In the 1970s and 1980s  Panama s growth fluctuated with the vagaries of the world economy  After 1973  economic expansion slowed considerably as the result of a number of international and domestic factors  Real GDP growth averaged 3 5 percent a year between 1973 and 1979  In the early 1980s  the economy rebounded with GDP growth rates of 15 4 percent in 1980  4 2 percent in 1981  and 5 6 percent in 1982  The acute recession in Latin America after 1982  however  wreaked havoc on Panama s economy  GDP growth in 1983 was a mere 0 4 percent  in 1984 it was negative 0 4 percent   This period coincided with the rise to power of General Manuel Noriega during which Panama became increasingly indebted  by 1986 owing SDR284m  US$360m  to the IMF alone  278% of their quota  This led to the IMF imposing an  adjustment program  supported by an IMF stand by arrangement in 1985–87 whilst the economy recovered somewhat  in 1985 Panama experienced economic recovery with 4 1 percent GDP growth  the corresponding figure for 1986 was estimated to be 2 8 percent  However the US started to pursue Noriega for fostering a  narco state  in Panama  culminating in sanctions that froze Panama s assets in the US  since Panama used the US dollar it was forced to default on its IMF debt on 28 December 1987  Economic turmoil in the country included a general strike and the banking system closing down for two months  Panama made a token payment the day before the IMF meeting in November 1988  but the situation did not resolve until 1989  Presidential elections in May 1989 were condemned by the international community as fraudulent and the IMF began to become impatient with Panama s increasing arrears which had now reached SDR121m  or US$150m  Eventually the US and Germany forced through a resolution on 30 June 1989 declaring Panama ineligible for further support from the IMF  the situation was eventually resolved by the US invasion of Panama  in December 1989 which forced the surrender of Noriega  SDR181 5m  ~$US230m  was still owed to the IMF in April 1990  the country regained access to IMF funds on 2 May 1992   After taking office in 1994 President Ernesto Perez Balladares set forth an economic liberalization program designed to liberalize the trade regime  attract foreign investment  privatize state owned enterprises  institute fiscal discipline and privatized its two ports in 1997 and approved the sale of the railroad in early assets  Panama joined the World Trade Organization  WTO  and a banking reform law was approved by the legislature in early 1998 and dismantled the Central bank  After two years of near stagnation the reforms began to take root  GDP grew by 3 6% in 1997 and grew by more than 6% in 1998  The most important sectors which drove growth were the Panama Canal and the shipping and port activities of The Colon Free Zone which also rebounded from a slow year in 1996   On September 1  1999  Mireya Moscoso  the widow of former President Arnulfo Arias Madrid  took office  During her administration  Moscoso attempted to strengthen social programs  especially for child and youth development  protection  and general welfare  Moscoso s administration successfully handled the Panama Canal transfer and was effective in the administration of the Canal   The PRD s Martin Torrijos won the presidency and a legislative majority in the National Assembly in 2004  Under Torrijos  Panama continued strong economic growth and initiated the Panama Canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is scheduled to be completed by 2014 at a cost of $5 3 billion   about 25% of current GDP  The expansion project will more than double the Canal s capacity  enabling it to accommodate ships that are now too large to transverse the transoceanic crossway  and should help to reduce the high unemployment rate  Strong economic performance had reduced the national poverty level to 29% in 2008   In 2008  Panama had the second most unequal income distribution in Latin America  The Torrijos government implemented tax reforms  as well as social security reforms  and backed regional trade agreements and development of tourism  Not a CAFTA signatory  Panama in December 2006 independently negotiated a free trade agreement with the US  which  when implemented  should help promote the country s economic growth   In May 2009  Panama held its general elections and selected Ricardo Martinelli as president  President Martinelli assumed the presidency on July 1 and has promised to promote free trade  establish a Panama City metro system at an approximate cost of $1 0 billion  reform the health care system  and complete the expansion plan for the Panama Canal  President Martinelli also emphasized the importance of transforming Panama into a “safer  modern and supportive” nation devoted to improving the living conditions of its population through efficient and accountable governance   3  Financial services  Panama is in the unusual position of having a substantial financial services sector despite being a dollarized economy that has no central bank to act as a lender of last resort to rescue banks that get in trouble  As a result Panamanian banks are very conservatively run  with an average capital adequacy ratio of 15 6% in 2012  nearly double the legal minimum  The sector grew up providing trade finance for trade passing through the Canal  and later evolved into money laundering for the drug trade under Noriega  Since the global financial crisis of 2007–08 the country has been trying to shake off its reputation as a tax haven  signing double taxation treaties with many  mostly OECD  countries and in April 2011 a treaty on the exchange of financial information with the United States   4  Agriculture  For centuries  agriculture was the dominant economic activity for most of Panama s population  After the construction of the Panama Canal  agriculture declined  Its share of GDP fell from 29 percent in 1950 to just over 9 percent in 1985  1  Currently  agriculture and fisheries comprise 7 4% of the country s GDP  2  Panama is a net food importer and the U S  by far  is its main supplier  Though for many years  Panamanian agriculture remained poorly conditioned  after the 1970s agriculture became mechanized as industrialization became more intensified   5  Taxation  Taxation in Panama  which is governed by the Fiscal Code  is on a territorial basis  this is to say  that taxes apply only to income or gains derived through business carried on in Panama itself  The existence of a sales or administration office in Panama  or the re invoicing of external transactions at a profit  does not of itself give rise to taxation if the underlying transactions take place outside Panama  Dividends paid out of such earnings are free of taxation   In February  2005  Panama’s unicameral legislature approved a major fiscal reform package in order to raise revenues from new business taxes  and increases the country’s level of debt  The legislature voted 46 to 28 in favour of the measures  which include a new 1 4% tax on companies’ gross revenues  and a 1% levy on firms operating in the Colon Free Trade Zone – the largest free port in the Americas   5 1  Further reforms  President Ricardo Martinelli had promised to implement a flat tax system with a flat tax of 10% and which promised to raise revenues  put inflation under control and which will allow enormous real wage gains  Instead the Martinelli government increased sales tax to 7% from 5%  as well as increasing other taxes  in order to finance many infrastructure projects around the country   6  Transportation  Highways are well developed for Latin America  In Panama City there are six highways  the Panama Arraijan Bridge of the Americas  Panama Arraijan Centennial Bridge  Arraijan Chorrera  Corredor Norte  Corredor Sur  and Autopista Alberto Motta   Panama s roads  traffic and transportation systems are generally safe  with traffic lights having undergone a recent overhaul and most have been replaced by intelligent traffic lights  even at busy intersections where they are not needed  Driving during the midday is usually slow and demanding due to dense traffic  frequent traffic jams  and street renovation programs  On roads where poor lighting and driving conditions prevail  night driving is difficult and in many cases  restricted by local authorities  this usually occurs in informal settlements  Night driving is particularly hazardous in these areas  Traffic in Panama moves on the right  and Panamanian law requires that drivers and passengers wear seat belts   Currently  Panama has an extensive and efficient  yet confusing to tourists  form of public transportation consisting of colorful painted buses colloquially known as   A is usually  customized  or painted with bright colors  usually depicting famous actors  politicians or singers  It is now popular all over the city  and also in neighboring towns  for bus drivers to personally customize the interior and exterior of their   Panama City s streets experience frequent traffic jams due to poor planning for the now extensive private vehicle fleet   7  See also  Mineral industry of Panama  8  References  9  External links
