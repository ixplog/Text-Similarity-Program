Pope Alexander I  died c  115  was the Bishop of Rome from c  107 to his death c  115  The Holy See s Annuario Pontificio  2012  identifies him as a Roman who reigned from 108 or 109 to 116 or 119  Some believe he suffered martyrdom under the Roman Emperor Trajan or Hadrian  but this is improbable   1  Life and legend  According to the Liber Pontificalis  it was Alexander I who inserted the narration of the Last Supper  the Qui pridie  into the Catholic celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass  However  the article on Saint Alexander I in the 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia  written by Thomas Shahan  judges this tradition to be inaccurate  a view shared by both Catholic and non Catholic experts  It is viewed as a product of the agenda of Liber Pontificalis—this section of the book was probably written in the late 5th century—to show an ancient pattern of the earliest bishops of Rome ruling the church by papal decree   The introduction of the customs of using blessed water mixed with salt for the purification of Christian homes from evil influences  as well as that of mixing water with the sacramental wine  are attributed to Pope Alexander I  Some sources consider these attributions unlikely  It is certainly possible  however  that Alexander played an important part in the early development of the Church of Rome s emerging liturgical and administrative traditions   A later tradition holds that in the reign of Emperor Hadrian  Alexander I converted the Roman governor Hermes by miraculous means  together with his entire household of 1 500 people  Saint Quirinus of Neuss  who was Alexander s supposed jailer  and Quirinus  daughter Saint Balbina were also among his converts   Alexander is said to have seen a vision of the infant Jesus  His remains are said to have been transferred to Freising in Bavaria  Germany in AD 834   2  Supposed identification with a martyr  Some editions of the Roman Missal identified with Pope Alexander I the Saint Alexander that they give as commemorated  together with Saints Eventius and Theodulus  who were supposed to be priests of his   on 3 May  See  for instance  the General Roman Calendar of 1954  But nothing is known of these three saints other than their names  together with the fact that they were martyred and were buried at the seventh milestone of the Via Nomentana on 3 May of some year  For this reason  the Pope John XXIII s 1960 revision of the calendar returned to the presentation that was in the 1570 Tridentine Calendar of the three saints as simply  Saints Alexander  Eventius and Theodulus Martyrs  with no suggestion that any of them was a pope  The Roman Martyrology lists them as Eventius  Alexander and Theodulus  the order in which their names are given in historical documents   3  References  4  Further reading  Benedict XVI  The Roman Martyrology  Gardners Books  2007  ISBN 978 0 548 13374 3   Chapman  John  Studies on the Early Papacy  Port Washington  NY  Kennikat Press  1971  ISBN 978 1 901157 60 4   Fortescue  Adrian  and Scott M  P  Reid  The Early Papacy  To the Synod of Chalcedon in 451  Southampton  Saint Austin Press  1997  ISBN 978 1 901157 60 4   Jowett  George F  The Drama of the Lost Disciples  London  Covenant Pub  Co  1968  OCLC 7181392  Loomis  Louise Ropes  The Book of Popes  Liber Pontificalis   Merchantville  NJ  Evolution Publishing  ISBN 1 889758 86 8
