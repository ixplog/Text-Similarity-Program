The Peter Principle is a concept in management theory in which the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate s performance in their current role rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role  Thus  employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively  and  managers rise to the level of their incompetence    The principle is named after Laurence J  Peter who co authored with Raymond Hull the humorous 1969 book The Peter Principle  Why Things Always Go Wrong   1  Overview  The Peter Principle is a special case of a ubiquitous observation  Anything that works will be used in progressively more challenging applications until it fails  This is  The Generalized Peter Principle   There is much temptation to use what has worked before  even when it may exceed its effective scope  Peter observed this about humans   In an organizational structure  the assessment of the potential of an employee for a promotion is often based on their performance in the current job which results eventually in their being promoted to their highest level of competence and potentially then to a role in which they are not competent  referred to as their  level of incompetence   The employee has no chance of further promotion  thus reaching their career s ceiling in an organization   Peter suggests that   i n time  every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties  and that  work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence   He coined the term hierarchiology as the social science concerned with the basic principles of hierarchically organized systems in the human society   He noted that their incompetence may be a result of the skills required being different rather than more difficult  by way of example  an excellent engineer may find that they made a poor manager due to a limitation of the interpersonal skills required by a manager to effectively lead a team   Rather than seeking to promote a talented “super competent” junior employee  Peter suggested that an incompetent manager may set them up to fail or dismiss them because they will likely  violate the first commandment of hierarchical life with incompetent leadership   namely that  the hierarchy must be preserved    2  Responses  There are methods that organizations can use to mitigate the risk associated with the Peter Principle   Refrain from promoting workers based on their current performance without proof of their abilities to succeed in the desired role   Provide in service training for the desired roles for those being considered for promotion   Provide a parallel career path for good technical staff  possibly with the offer of additional pay  perks or recognition without requiring promotion to management  similar to a warrant officer in the military   Implement an Up or out approach as authorized by the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act for the United States Armed Forces and by manning control policies within the British Army  in which personnel who are not promoted above certain ranks within the fixed number of years are deemed to lack the necessary competence and are likely to be dismissed  Some larger businesses  notably major international management consultancies accountancy firms including McKinsey  BCG  and Bain use a similar method  or the  vitality curve  or  rank and yank  used by GE where employees who are ranked in the bottom 5 10% on performance are likely to be fired   3  Research  Alessandro Pluchino  Andrea Rapisarda and Cesare Garofalo used an agent based modelling approach to simulate the promotion of employees in a system where the Peter Principle is assumed to be true  They found that the best way to improve efficiency in an enterprise is to promote people randomly  or to shortlist the best and the worst performer in a given group  from which the person to be promoted is then selected randomly  For this work  they won the 2010 Ig Nobel Prize in management science   A similar theory was proposed by Scott Adams  creator of the Dilbert cartoon series  In his 1996 book  The Dilbert Principle  Adams suggested that  the least smart people are promoted  simply because they’re the ones you don t want doing actual work   In other words people are promoted because of their incompetence in their current role  rather than their competence  Others have suggested the  Peter Principle in reverse   a management strategy of deliberately promoting an employee beyond their level of existing competency   4  Forerunners  In the 1910s  José Ortega y Gasset suggested that   All public employees should be demoted to their immediately lower level  as they have been promoted until turning incompetent    5  See also  Dunning–Kruger effect  Founder s syndrome  List of eponymous laws  Murphy s Law  Negative selection  politics   Office Space  Parkinson s law
