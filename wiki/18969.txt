The Myrtales are an order of flowering plants placed as a sister to the eurosids II clade as of the publishing of the Eucalyptus grandis genome in June 2014  Though the APG III system of classification for angiosperms still places it within the eurosids  The following families are included as of APG III   Alzateaceae S A Graham  Combretaceae R Br   leadwood family   Crypteroniaceae A DC   Lythraceae J St  Hil   loosestrife and pomegranate family   Melastomataceae Juss   including Memecylaceae DC    Myrtaceae Juss   myrtle family  including Heteropyxidaceae Engl  & Gilg  Psiloxylaceae Croizat   Onagraceae Juss   evening primrose family   Penaeaceae Sweet ex Guill   including Oliniaceae Arn   Rhynchocalycaceae L A S Johnson & B G Briggs   Vochysiaceae A St  Hil  The Cronquist system gives essentially the same composition  except the Vochysiaceae are removed to the order Polygalales  and the Thymelaeaceae are included  The families Sonneratiaceae  Trapaceae  and Punicaceae are removed from the Lythraceae  The APG III system agrees with the older Chronquist circumscriptions of treating Psiloxylaceae and Heteropyxidaceae within Myrtaceae  and Memecyclaceae within Melastomataceae   Ellagitannins are reported in dicotyledoneous angiospermes  and notably in species in the order Myrtales   1  Origins  Myrtales is dated to have begun 89 99 million years ago  mya  in Australasia  There is some contention as to that date however  which was obtained using nuclear DNA  When looking at chloroplast DNA  the mrytales ancestor is instead considered to have evolved in the mid cretaceous period  100mya  in Southeast Africa  rather than in Australasia  Although the APG system classifies myrtales as within the eurosids  the recently published genome of Eucalyptus grandis places the order myrtales as a sister to the eurosids rather than inside them  The discrepancy is thought to have arisen due to the difference between using a large number of taxa versus using a large number of genes for constructing a phylogeny   2  References  Conti  E   Erikkson  T   Schonenberger  J   Sytsma  K  J   & Baum  D  A   2002   Early Tertiary Out of India Dispersal of Crypteroniaceae  Evidence from Phylogeny and Molecular Dating  Evolution 56  10   1931–1942  Schönenberger  J  & Conti  E   2003   Molecular phylogeny and floral evolution of Penaeaceae  Oliniaceae  Rhynchocalycaceae  and Alzateaceae  Myrtales   American Journal of Botany 90  293–309   3  External links
