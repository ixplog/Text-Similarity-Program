Chios        alternative transliterations Khíos and Híos  is the fifth largest of the Greek islands  situated in the Aegean Sea  off the Anatolian coast  The island is separated from Turkey by the Chios Strait  Chios is notable for its exports of mastic gum and its nickname is The mastic island  Tourist attractions include its medieval villages and the 11th century monastery of Nea Moni  a UNESCO World Heritage Site   Administratively  the island forms a separate municipality within the Chios regional unit  which is part of the North Aegean region  The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality is Chios town  Locals refer to Chios town as  Chora    Χώρα  literally means land or country  but usually refers to the capital or a settlement at the highest point of a Greek island    1  Geography  Chios island is crescent or kidney shaped  long from north to south  at its widest  and covers an area of   The terrain is mountainous and arid  with a ridge of mountains running the length of the island  The two largest of these mountains   Pelineon     and  Epos      are situated in the north of the island  The center of the island is divided between east and west by a range of smaller peaks  known as  Provatas    1 1  Regions  Chios can be divided into five regions   1 1 1  East coast  Midway up the east coast lie the main population centers  the main town of Chios  and the regions of Vrontados and Kambos  Chios Town  with a population of 32 400  is built around the island s main harbour and medieval castle  The current castle  with a perimeter of   was principally constructed during the time of Venetian and Ottoman rule  although remains have been found dating settlements there back to 2000 B C  The town was substantially damaged by an earthquake in 1881  and only partially retains its original character   North of Chios Town lies the large suburb of Vrontados  population 4 500   which claims to be the birthplace of Homer  The suburb lies in the Omiroupoli municipality  and its connection to the poet is supported by an archaeological site known traditionally as  Teacher s Rock    Directly south of Chios Town lies the island s airport and the region of Kambos  Κάμπος   plain    a large fertile plain  Here there are stone mansions and walled orchards  At the southern edge of the Kambos plain lies the town of Thymiana  Thymiana is the sole source of a beige burgundy two tone sandstone used both in the local mansions and much of the town itself  Inland lie a number of villages rising up into the central mountains culminating with the village of Ayios Georgios Sykoussis  perched at the peak dividing east from west  Along the coast lies Karfas  Καρφάς   a sandy beach  which along with the nearby village of Ayia Ermioni  Άγια Ερμιόνη  is now the main tourist centre  with a number of large and small hotels   1 1 2  Southern region  Mastichochoria   In the south of the island are the Mastichochoria  literally  Mastic Villages  the seven villages of Mesta  Μεστά   Pyrgi  Πυργί   Olυmpi  Ολύμποι   Kalamoti  Καλαμωτń   Vessa  Βέσσα   Lithi  Λιθί  and Elata  Ελάτα   which together have controlled the production of mastic gum in the area since the Roman period  The villages  built between the 14th and 16th centuries  have a carefully designed layout with fortified gates and narrow streets to protect against the frequent raids by marauding pirates  Between Chios Town and the Mastichochoria lie a large number of historic villages including Armolia  Αρμόλια   Myrmighi  Μυρμήγκι   and Kalimassia  Καλλιμασιά   Along the east coast are the fishing villages of Kataraktis  Καταρράκτης  and to the south Nenita  Νένητα    The south coast has two populated areas  the bay of Komi and the ancient village of  Emporio   inhabited since 1800 BC  and the site of the black volcanic beach of  Mavra Volia   believed to have been created by the explosion of Santorini island in 1600 BC   1 1 3  West coast  The west coast  between the deep natural harbour of Limenas at the south and the town of Vollisos in the north  forms a crescent shaped series of almost uninhabited rocky bays  The nearest population centres are the two hillside villages of Lithi and Sidirounta  while further inland lie the villages of Elata  Vessa  Agio Giorgi  Avgonyma and the deserted village of Anavatos  There is a system of stone beacons that were built at regular intervals to signal the approach of ships  and warning the islanders against invasions by pirates   1 1 4  Northern region  The north of the island contains two villages  Volissos on the west coast  and Kardamyla on the east  Further to the north  are three villages where cherries are grown—Amades  Viki and Kambia  In June Kambia holds an annual Cherry Festival— Yiortí ton Kerrasión   Kambia holds several festivals during the summer months  Also located in the northern region is the island s tallest mountain  Mount Pelineon  at    Spartounda and Fyta lie a few miles from Kambia  In the village of Fyta stands a watchtower dating back to the late 16th century  the time of the Genoese occupation   The village of Kourounia lies north of Volissos in the northwestern part of the island  Next to Kourounia is the village of Egrigoros   1 1 5  Interior  Directly in the centre of the island  between the villages of Avgonyma to the west and Karyes to the east  is the 11th century monastery of Nea Moni  a UNESCO World Heritage Site  The monastery was built with funds given by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX  after three monks  living in caves nearby  had petitioned him while he was in exile on the island of Mytilene  The monastery had substantial estates attached  with a thriving community until the massacre of 1822  It was further damaged during the 1881 earthquake  In 1952  due to the shortage of monks  Nea Moni was converted to a convent   Further south is the region of Kambochoria  This is a collection of medieval villages  Halkios  Vavili  Vassileoniko  Ververato  Dafnonas  and Zifias  with a combined population of about 3 000 and an agricultural economy  In this region four varieties of wild tulips grow   West of the Kambochoria on the central ridge of the island lies the 16th century village of Agios Geórgios Sikousis  The village is situated above sea level  strategically overlooking both sides of the island  and was previously fortified with both a wall and a tower   1 2  Geology  The Chios Basin is a hydrographic sub unit of the Aegean Sea adjacent to the island of Chios   1 3  Climate  The island s climate is warm and moderate  categorised as Temperate  Mediterranean Csa   with modest variation due to the stabilising effect of the surrounding sea  Average temperatures normally range from a summer high of to a winter low of in January  although temperatures of over or below freezing can sometimes be encountered   Rainfall while usually plentiful  varies greatly both throughout the year and between years  Rain is rare during the summer months  but the winters are changeable and wet  Sunshine is plentiful  as is typical of the Eastern Mediterranean  with almost no cloud cover in the summer months  Average humidity varies from 75% in winter to 60% in summer   The island normally experiences steady breezes  average 3–5 m s  throughout the year  with winds direction predominantly northerly   Etesian  Wind—locally called the  Meltemi    or south westerly  Sirocco    2  History  2 1  Etymology  Known as  Ophioussa   Οφιούσσα   snake island   and  Pityoussa   Πιτυούσσα   pine tree island   in Antiquity  during the later Middle Ages the island was ruled by a number of non Greek powers and was known as Scio  Genoese   Chio  Italian  and Sakız  صاقيز —Ottoman Turkish   The capital during that time was  Kastron   Κάστρον   castle     2 2  Prehistoric period  Archaeological research on Chios has found evidence of habitation dating back at least to the Neolithic era  The primary sites of research for this period have been cave dwellings at Hagio n  Galas  in the north  and a settlement and accompanying necropolis in modern day Emporeio at the far south of the island  Scholars lack information on this period  The size and duration of these settlements have therefore not been well established   The British School at Athens excavated the Emporeio site in 1952–1955  and most current information comes from these digs  The Greek Archaeological Service has also been excavating periodically on Chios since 1970  though much of its work on the island remains unpublished   The noticeable uniformity in the size of houses at Emporeio leads some scholars to believe that there may have been little social distinction during the Neolithic era on the island  The inhabitants apparently all benefited from agricultural and livestock farming   It is also widely held by scholars that the island was not occupied by humans during the Middle Bronze Age  2300–1600   though researchers have recently suggested that the lack of evidence from this period may only demonstrate the lack of excavations on Chios and the northern Aegean   By at least the 11th century BC the island was ruled by a monarchy  and the subsequent transition to aristocratic  or possibly tyrannic  rule occurred sometime over the next four centuries  Future excavations may reveal more information about this period  9th century Euboean and Cypriote presence on the island is attested by ceramics  while a Phoenician presence is noted at Erythrae  the traditional competitor of Chios on the mainland   2 3  Archaic and Classical periods  Pherecydes  native to the Aegean  wrote that the island was occupied by the Leleges  aboriginal Greeks themselves reported to be subject to the Minoans on Crete  They were eventually driven out by invading Ionians   Chios was one of the original twelve member states of the Ionian League  As a result  Chios  at the end of the 7th century BC  was one of the first cities to strike or mint coins  establishing the sphinx as its specific symbol  It maintained this tradition for almost 900 years   In the 6th century BC Chios’ government adopted a constitution similar to that developed by Solon in Athens and later developed democratic elements with a voting assembly and people’s magistrates called damarchoi   In 546 BC Chios became subject to the Persian Empire  Chios joined the Ionian Revolt against the Persians in 499 BC  The naval power of Chios during this period is demonstrated by the fact that the Chians had the largest fleet  100 ships  of all the Ionians at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC  At Lade the Chian fleet continued doggedly fighting the Persian fleet even after the defection of the Samians and others but ultimately the Chians were forced to retreat and were again subject to Persian domination   The defeat of Persia at the Battle of Mycale in 479 BC meant the liberation of Chios from Persian rule  When the Athenians formed the Delian League Chios joined as one of the few members who did not have to pay tribute but instead supplied ships to the alliance   By the fifth to 4th centuries BC  the island had grown to an estimated population of over 120 000  two to three times the estimated population in 2005   based on the huge necropolis at the main city of Chios  It is thought that the majority of the population lived in that area   In 412 BC during the Peloponnesian War Chios revolted against Athens and the Athenians besieged it  Relief only came the following year when the Spartans were able to raise the siege  In the 4th century BC Chios was a member of the Second Athenian Empire but revolted against Athens during the Social War  357–355 BC   and Chios became independent again until the rise of Macedonia   2 4  Hellenistic period  In the decades immediately preceding Macedonia s domination of the Greek city states  Chios was home to a school of rhetoric which Isocrates had founded  as well as a faction aligned with Sparta  After the Battle of Leuctra  supporters of the Lacedaemonians were exiled  Among the exiled were Damasistratus and his son Theopompus  who had received instruction from the school and went on to study with Isocrates in Athens before becoming a historian   Theopompus moved back to Chios with the other exiles in 333 BC after Alexander had invaded Asia Minor and decreed their return  as well as the exile or trial of Persian supporters on the island  Theopompus was exiled again sometime after Alexander s death and took refuge in Egypt   During this period  the island also had become the largest exporter of Greek wine  which was noted for being of relatively high quality  see  Chian wine    Chian amphoras  with a characteristic sphinx emblem and bunches of grape have been found in nearly every country that the ancient Greeks traded with from as far away as Gaul  Upper Egypt and Southern Russia   2 5  Roman period  During the Third Macedonian War  thirty five vessels allied to Rome  carrying about 1 000 Galatian troops  as well as a number of horses  were sent by Eumenes II to his brother Attalus   Leaving from Elaea  they were headed to the harbour of Phanae  planning to disembark from there to Macedonia  However  Perseus s naval commander Antenor intercepted the fleet between Erythrae  on the Western coast of Turkey  and Chios   According to Livy  they were caught completely off guard by Antenor  Eumenes  officers at first thought the intercepting fleet were friendly Romans  but scattered upon realizing they were facing an attack by their Macedonian enemy  some choosing to abandon ship and swim to Erythrae  Others  crashing their ships into land on Chios  fled toward the city   The Chians however closed their gates  startled at the calamity  And the Macedonians  who had docked closer to the city anyway  cut the rest of the fleet off outside the city gates  and on the road leading to the city  Of the 1 000 men  800 were killed  200 taken prisoner    After the Roman conquest Chios became part of the province of Asia   Pliny remarks upon the islanders  use of variegated marble in their buildings  and their appreciation for such stone above murals or other forms of artificial decoration   2 6  Byzantine period  After the permanent division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD  Chios was for six centuries part of the Byzantine Empire  This came to an end when the island was briefly held  1090–97  by Tzachas  a Turkish bey in the region of Smyrna during the first expansion of the Turks to the Aegean coast  However  the Turks were driven back from the Aegean coast by the Byzantines aided by the First Crusade  and the island was restored to Byzantine rule by admiral Constantine Dalassenos   This relative stability was ended by the sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade  1204  and during the turmoil of the 13th century the island s ownership was constantly affected by the regional power struggles  After the Fourth Crusade  the Byzantine empire was divided up by the Latin emperors of Constantinople  with Chios nominally becoming a possession of the Republic of Venice  However  defeats for the Latin empire resulted in the island reverting to Byzantine rule in 1225   2 7  Genoese period  1304–1566   The Byzantine rulers had little influence and through the Treaty of Nymphaeum  authority was ceded to the Republic of Genoa  1261   At this time the island was frequently attacked by pirates  and by 1302–1303 was a target for the renewed Turkish fleets  To prevent Turkish expansion  the island was reconquered and kept as a renewable concession  at the behest of the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus  by the Genovese Benedetto I Zaccaria  1304   then admiral to Philip of France  Zaccaria installed himself as ruler of the island  founding the short lived Lordship of Chios  His rule was benign and effective control remained in the hands of the local Greek landowners  Benedetto Zacharia was followed by his son Paleologo and then his grandsons or nephews Benedetto II and Martino  They attempted to turn the island towards the Latin and Papal powers  and away from the predominant Byzantine influence  The locals  still loyal to the Byzantine Empire  responded to a letter from the emperor and  despite a standing army of a thousand infantrymen  a hundred cavalrymen and two galleys  expelled the Zacharia family from the island  1329  and dissolved the fiefdom   Local rule was brief  In 1346  a chartered company or Maona  the  Maona di Chio e di Focea   was set up in Genoa to reconquer and exploit Chios and the neighbouring town of Phocaea in Asia Minor  Although the islanders firmly rejected an initial offer of protection  the island was invaded by a Genoese fleet  led by Simone Vignoso  and the castle besieged  Again rule was transferred peacefully  as on 12 September the castle was surrendered and a treaty signed with no loss of privileges to the local landowners as long as the new authority was accepted   The Genoese  being interested in profit rather than conquest  controlled the trade posts and warehouses  in particular the trade of mastic  alum  salt and pitch  Other trades such as grain  wine oil and cloth and most professions were run jointly with the locals  After a failed uprising in 1347  and being heavily outnumbered  less than 10% of the population in 1395   the Latins maintained light control over the local population  remaining largely in the town and allowing full religious freedom  In this way the island remained under Genoese control for two centuries  By 1566  when Genoa lost Chios to the Ottoman Empire  there were 12 000 Greeks and 2 500 Genoese  or 20% of the total population  in the island   By the early 15th century  Asia Minor and the surrounding islands had fallen under Ottoman rule  but the Genoese families managed to maintain control over the island through the payment of a tribute to the Sultan  By the 16th century  as Genoese power waned  trade with Genoa had decreased and the local rulers become assimilated into the local population   This largely independent rule of Genoese families continued until 1566  when  with tensions rising  the Sultan decided that the island could potentially be used as a base for Western attacks on Constantinople  The island was invaded by Ottoman troops and absorbed into the Ottoman Empire  Consequently  Greek Phanariotes gradually replaced these Genoese families as a protectorate of Chios and maintained relative autonomy despite the Ottoman occupation   2 8  Ottoman period  During Ottoman rule  the government and tax gathering again remained in the hands of Greeks and the Turkish garrison was small and inconspicuous   As well as the Latin and Turkish influx  documents record a small Jewish population from at least 1049 AD  The original Greek  Romaniote  Jews  thought to have been brought over by the Romans  were later joined by Sephardic Jews welcomed by the Ottomans during the Iberian expulsions of the 15th century   The mainstay of the island s famous wealth was the mastic crop  Chios was able to make a substantial contribution to the imperial treasury while at the same time maintaining only a light level of taxation  The Ottoman government regarded it as one of the most valuable provinces of the Empire   2 9  Modern period  When the Greek War of Independence broke out  the island s leaders were reluctant to join the revolutionaries  fearing the loss of their security and prosperity  However  in March 1822  several hundred armed Greeks from the neighbouring island of Samos landed in Chios  They proclaimed the Revolution and launched attacks against the Turks  at which point islanders decided to join the struggle   Ottomans landed a large force on the island consequently and put down the rebellion  The Ottoman massacre of Chios expelled  killed  or enslaved the inhabitants of the island  It wiped out whole villages  and affected the Mastichochoria area  the mastic growing villages in the south of the island  It triggered negative public reaction in Western Europe  as portrayed by Eugène Delacroix  and in the writing of Lord Byron and Victor Hugo   In 1881  an earthquake  estimated as 6 5 on the moment magnitude scale  damaged a large portion of the island s buildings and resulted in great loss of life  Reports of the time spoke of 5 500–10 000 fatalities   Chios rejoined the rest of independent Greece after the First Balkan War  1912   The Greek Navy liberated Chios in November 1912 in a hard fought but brief amphibious operation  Turkey recognized Greece s annexation of Chios and the other Aegean islands by the Treaty of London  1913    It was affected by the population exchanges after the Greco–Turkish War of 1919–1922  the incoming Greek refugees settling in Kastro  previously Turkish  and in new settlements hurriedly built south of Chios Town   During World War II  the island was occupied by Nazi Germany  1941–44   resulting in deprivation for the inhabitants  The larger part of the Jewish population had left earlier in the century  but as in all Nazi occupied territories  the Jewish community was hunted down for arrest and trans shipping to concentration camps for extermination  In 1943  the local government warned the Jewish population of the island that the Gestapo had orders to arrest them all and take them to Germany  Some families heeded the warning and were smuggled off the island  Others were protected by the local Greek villages  particularly in the southern towns with high elevation  i e   Tholopotami  St Georgios and Kalamoti  Local Greeks risked high penalties to protect Jewish inhabitants  The remainder were taken by the Gestapo and nothing more is known of their fate  they are assumed to have perished in one of the Nazi extermination camps   The island saw some local violence during the Greek Civil War setting neighbour against neighbour  This ended when the final band of communist fighters was trapped and killed in the orchards of Kambos and their bodies driven through the main town on the back of a truck  In March 1948  the island was used as an internment camp for female political detainees  communists or relatives of guerillas  and their children  who were housed in military barracks near the town of Chios  Up to 1300 women and 50 children were housed in cramped and degrading conditions  until March 1949 when the camp was closed and the inhabitants moved to Trikeri   The production of mastic was threatened by the Chios forest fire that swept the southern half of the island in August 2012 and destroyed some mastic groves   3  Demographics  According to the 2011 census  Chios has a permanent resident population of 52 674   According to the Greek Embassy in America  there are about 20 000 Chians in United States today   4  Government  The present municipality Chios was formed at the 2011 local government reform by
