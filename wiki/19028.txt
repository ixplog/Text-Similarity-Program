Martial arts film is a film genre  A subgenre of the action film  martial arts films contain numerous martial arts fights between characters  usually as the films  primary appeal and entertainment value  and often as a method of storytelling and character expression and development  Martial arts are frequently featured in training scenes and other sequences in addition to fights  Martial arts films commonly include other types of action  such as stuntwork  chases  and or gunfights   1  History  As with other action films  martial arts films are dominated by action to varying degrees  many martial arts films have only a minimal plot and amount of character development and focus almost exclusively on the action  while other martial arts films have more creative and complex plots and characters along with action scenes  Films of the latter type are generally considered to be artistically superior films  but many films of the former type are commercially successful and well received by fans of the genre   Martial arts films contain many characters who are martial artists  and these roles are often played by actors who are real martial artists  If not  actors frequently train in preparation for their roles  or the action director may rely more on stylized action or film making tricks like camera angles  editing  doubles  undercranking  wire work  and computer generated imagery  Trampolines and springboards can also be used to increase the height of jumps  These techniques are sometimes used by real martial artists as well  depending on the style of action in the film   During the 1970s and 1980s  the most visible presence of martial arts films was the hundreds of English dubbed kung fu and ninja films produced by the Shaw Brothers  Godfrey Ho  and other Hong Kong producers  These films were widely broadcast on North American television on weekend timeslots that were often colloquially known as Kung Fu Theater  Black Belt Theater  or variations thereof  Inclusive in this list of films are commercial classics like The Big Boss  Drunken Master  and One Armed Boxer   Martial arts films have been produced all over the world  but the genre has been dominated by Hong Kong action cinema  peaking from 1971 with the rise of Bruce Lee until the mid 1990s with a general decline in the industry  Other notable figures in the genre include Jackie Chan  Jet Li  Sammo Hung  Yuen Biao  and Donnie Yen   Sonny Chiba has appeared with karate and jidaigeki from Japan of the 1970s  Hollywood has also participated in the genre with actors such as Chuck Norris  Jean Claude Van Damme  Steven Seagal  Brandon Lee  son of Bruce Lee   Wesley Snipes  Gary Daniels  Mark Dacascos  and Jason Statham  In the 2000s  Thailand s film industry became an international force in the genre with the films of Tony Jaa  and the Cinema of Vietnam followed suit with The Rebel and Clash  In more recent years  the Indonesian film industry has offered Merantau  2009  and The Raid  Redemption  2011    Women have also played key roles in the genre  including such actresses as Michelle Yeoh  Angela Mao  and Cynthia Rothrock  In addition  western animation has ventured into the genre with the most successful effort being the internationally hailed DreamWorks Animation film franchise  Kung Fu Panda  starring Jack Black and Angelina Jolie  Currently  an independent kung fu fantasy film called  Sins of the Dragon  is being produced by the new production company Platypus Underground  Ltd  It will be released in December   2  Subgenres  Kung fu films are a significant movie genre in themselves  Like westerns for Americans  they have become an identity of Chinese cinema  As the most prestigious movie type in Chinese film history  Kung Fu movies were among the first Chinese films produced and the wuxia period films 武俠片  are the original form of Chinese Kung Fu films  The wuxia period films came into vogue due to the thousands of years popularity of wuxia novels 武俠小說   For example  Jin Yong and Gu Long  their wuxia novels directly led to the prevalence of wuxia period films  The most famous wuxia film made was the Ang Lee masterpiece Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon  which was based on the Wang Dulu series of wuxia novels  it earned four Academy Awards  including one for Best Foreign Film   In Chinese speaking world  martial arts films are commonly divided into two subcategories   the wuxia period films 武俠片   and the more modern Kung fu films 功夫片  best epitomized in the films of Bruce Lee    In Chinese speaking world  martial arts films commonly refer to a genre wuxia which presents historical background  usually in ancient dynasties  there lives a common person  usually poor and without social status  but possessing a kind heart and would like to help people and fight for justice  so the character develops though the plot fighting against the bad ones who hold the power and finally achieves the peace and justice for people and becomes a master of martial arts   3  See also  List of martial arts films  List of mixed martial arts films  Combat in film  Orange Sky Golden Harvest  Samurai cinema
