Television  TV  is a telecommunication medium that is used for transmitting and receiving moving images and sound  Television can transmit images that are monochrome  black and white   in color or in three dimensions  Television may also refer specifically to a television set  television program or television transmission   First commercially available in very crude form on an experimental basis in the late 1920s  then popularized in greatly improved form shortly after World War II  the television set has become commonplace in homes  businesses and institutions  particularly as a vehicle for entertainment  advertising and news  During the 1950s  television became the primary medium for molding public opinion  In the mid 1960s  color broadcasting and sales of color television sets surged in the US and began in most other developed countries  The availability of storage media such as VHS  mid 1970s   laserdiscs  1978   Video CDs  1993   DVDs  1997   and high definition Blu ray Discs  2006  enabled viewers to use the television set to watch recorded material such as movies and broadcast material  Since 2010s  Internet television has seen the rise of television programming available via the Internet through services such as iPlayer  Hulu  and Netflix   In 2013  79% of the world s households owned a television set  The replacement of bulky  high voltage cathode ray tube  CRT  screen displays with compact  energy efficient  flat panel alternatives such as plasma displays  LCDs  both fluorescent backlit and LED backlit   and OLED displays was a major hardware revolution that began penetrating the consumer computer monitor market in the late 1990s and soon spread to TV sets  In 2014  most of the TV sets sold were LCDs mainly LED backlit LCD displays  Major TV manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT  RPTV  plasma and even fluorescent backlit LCDs by 2014   The television signals are distributed as broadcast television which is modeled on the radio broadcasting systems  Broadcast television uses high powered radio frequency transmitters to broadcast the television signal to individual television receivers  Until the early 2000s  broadcast television was generally transmitted as an analog signal but soon countries started switching to digital signals  with the transition expected to be completed worldwide by 2020  In addition to terrestrial transmission  television signals are also distributed by cable  digital transition is ongoing  and satellite  digital only  systems   A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits  including circuits for receiving and decoding broadcast signals  A visual display device which lacks a tuner is properly called a video monitor rather than a television  Television systems are also used for surveillance  industrial process control and in places where direct observation is difficult or dangerous   1  Etymology  The word television comes    2  History  Invention of the television was work of many people in the 19th century and early 20th century   2 1  Mechanical television  Facsimile transmission systems for still photographs pioneered methods of mechanical scanning of images in early 19th century  Alexander Bain introduced the facsimile machine in 1843 to 1846  Frederick Bakewell demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1951   Willoughby Smith discovered the photoconductivity of the element selenium in 1873   As a 23 year old German university student  Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow proposed and patented the Nipkow disk in 1884  This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it  so each hole scanned a line of the image  Although he never built a working model of the system  variations of Nipkow s spinning disk  image rasterizer  became exceedingly common  Constantin Perskyi had coined the word television in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the International World Fair in Paris on August 25  1900  Perskyi s paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies  mentioning the work of Nipkow and others  However  it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology  by Lee de Forest and Arthur Korn among others  made the design practical   The first demonstration of the instantaneous transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A  Fournier in Paris in 1909  A matrix of 64 selenium cells  individually wired to a mechanical commutator  served as an electronic retina  In the receiver  a type of Kerr cell modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen  A separate circuit regulated synchronization  The 8x8 pixel resolution in this proof of concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet  An updated image was transmitted  several times  each second   In 1911  Boris Rosing and his student Vladimir Zworykin created a system that used a mechanical mirror drum scanner to transmit  in Zworykin s words   very crude images  over wires to the  Braun tube   cathode ray tube or  CRT   in the receiver  Moving images were not possible because  in the scanner   the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy    By the 1920s  when amplification made television practical  Scottish inventor John Logie Baird employed the Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems  On March 25  1925  Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion  at Selfridge s Department Store in London  Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system  he televised a ventriloquist s dummy named  Stooky Bill  talking and moving  whose painted face had higher contrast  By January 26  1926 he demonstrated the transmission of image of a face in motion by radio  This is widely regarded as first television demonstration  The subject was Baird s business partner Oliver Hutchinson  Baird s system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it  A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject  Selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal  This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit  where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first  The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image  As each hole in the disk passed by  one scan line of the image was reproduced  Baird s disk had 30 holes  producing an image with only 30 scan lines  just enough to recognize a human face  In 1927  Baird transmitted a signal over of telephone line between London and Glasgow  In 1928  Baird s company  Baird Television Development Company Cinema Television  broadcast the first transatlantic television signal  between London and New York  and the first shore to ship transmission  In 1929  he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany  In November of the same year  Baird and Bernard Natan of Pathé established France s first television company  Télévision Baird Natan  In 1931  he made the first outdoor remote broadcast  of the Epsom Derby  In 1932  he demonstrated ultra short wave television  Baird s mechanical system reached a peak of 240 lines of resolution on BBC television broadcasts in 1936 though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly  Instead a 17 5mm film was shot  rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet   An American inventor  Charles Francis Jenkins also pioneered the television  He published an article on  Motion Pictures by Wireless  in 1913  but it was not until 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses  and it was on June 13th  1925 that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures  In 1925 Jenkins used Nipkow disk and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion  over a distance of five miles from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington  D C   using a lensed disk scanner with a 48 line resolution  He was granted the U S  patent No  1 544 156  Transmitting Pictures over Wireless  on June 30  1925  filed March 13  1922    Herbert E  Ives and Frank Gray of Bell Telephone Laboratories gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on April 7  1927  The reflected light television system included both small and large viewing screens  The small receiver had a two inch wide by 2 5 inch high screen  The large receiver had a screen 24 inches wide by 30 inches high  Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate  monochromatic moving images  Along with the pictures  the sets also received synchronized sound  The system transmitted images over two paths  first  a copper wire link from Washington to New York City  then a radio link from Whippany  New Jersey  Comparing the two transmission methods  viewers noted no difference in quality  Subjects of the telecast included Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover  A flying spot scanner beam illuminated these subjects  The scanner that produced the beam had a 50 aperture disk  The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second  capturing one frame about every 56 milliseconds   Today s systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second  or one frame every 33 3 or 16 7 milliseconds respectively   Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration   It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time  It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality    In 1928  WRGB then W2XB was started as world s first television station  It broadcast from the General Electric facility in Schenectady  NY  It was popularly known as  WGY Television    Meanwhile in the Soviet Union  Léon Theremin had been developing a mirror drum based television  starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925  then 32 lines and eventually 64 using interlacing in 1926  and as part of his thesis on May 7  1926 he electrically transmitted and then projected near simultaneous moving images on a five foot square screen  By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines  a resolution that was not surpassed until 1931 by RCA  with 120 lines   On December 25  1925  Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a television system with a 40 line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan  This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum in Shizuoka University  Hamamatsu Campus  His research in creating a production model was halted by the US after Japan lost World War II   Because only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks  and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical  image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low  ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so  Nevertheless  the image quality of 30 line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances  and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear  A few systems ranging into the 200 line region also went on the air  Two of these were the 180 line system that Compagnie des Compteurs  CDC  installed in Paris in 1935  and the 180 line system that Peck Television Corp  started in 1935 at station VE9AK in Montreal   The advancement of all electronic television  including image dissectors and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer  marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television  Mechanical TV usually only produced small images  It was the main type of TV until the 1930s  The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States   2 2  Electronic television  In 1897  J  J  Thomson  an English physicist in his three famous experiments  was able to deflect cathode rays  a fundamental function of the modern CRT  The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and is also known as the Braun tube  It was a cold cathode diode  a modification of the Crookes tube with a phosphor coated screen In 1907  Russian scientist Boris Rosing used a CRT in the receiving end of an experimental video signal to form a picture  He managed to display simple geometric shapes onto the screen  which marked the first time that CRT technology was used for what is now known as television  In 1908 Alan Archibald Campbell Swinton  fellow of the Royal Society  UK   published a letter in the scientific journal Nature in which he described how  distant electric vision  could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube  or  Braun  tube  after its inventor  Karl Braun  as both a transmitting and receiving device  He expanded on his vision in a speech given in London in 1911 and reported in The Times and the Journal of the Röntgen Society  In a letter to Nature published in October 1926  Campbell Swinton also announced the results of some  not very successful experiments  he had conducted with G  M  Minchin and J  C  M  Stanton  They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam  These experiments were conducted before March 1914  when Minchin died  but they were later repeated by two different teams in 1937  by H  Miller and J  W  Strange from EMI  and by H  Iams and A  Rose from RCA  Both teams succeeded in transmitting  very faint  images with the original Campbell Swinton s selenium coated plate  Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver  the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel  The first cathode ray tube to use a hot cathode was developed by John B  Johnson  who gave his name to the term Johnson noise  and Harry Weiner Weinhart of Western Electric  and became a commercial product in 1922   In 1926  Hungarian engineer Kálmán Tihanyi designed a television system utilizing fully electronic scanning and display elements and employing the principle of  charge storage  within the scanning  or  camera   tube  The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or  camera  tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge storage technology by Kálmán Tihanyi beginning in 1924  His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges   photoelectrons   within the tube throughout each scanning cycle  The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed  Radioskop   After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application  Tihanyi s patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930  and so he applied for patents in the United States  Although his breakthrough would be incorporated into the design of RCA s  iconoscope  in 1931  the U S  patent for Tihanyi s transmitting tube would not be granted until May 1939  The patent for his receiving tube had been granted the previous October  Both patents had been purchased by RCA prior to their approval  Charge storage remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day   On 25 December 1926  Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a TV system with a 40 line resolution that employed a CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan  This was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver  Takayanagi did not apply for a patent   On September 7  1927  Farnsworth s image dissector camera tube transmitted its first image  a simple straight line  at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco  By September 3  1928  Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press  In 1929  the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator  so that his television system now had no mechanical parts  That year  Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system  including a three and a half inch image of his wife Elma   Pem   with her eyes closed  possibly due to the bright lighting required    Meanwhile  Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images  While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923  he began to develop an electronic camera tube  But in a 1925 demonstration  the image was dim  had low contrast and poor definition  and was stationary  Zworykin s imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage  But RCA  which acquired the Westinghouse patent  asserted that the patent for Farnsworth s 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device  Thus RCA  on the basis of Zworykin s 1923 patent application  filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth  The U S  Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision  finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin  Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin s 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent  Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application  he also divided his original application in 1931  Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application  In September 1939  after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment  RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten year period  in addition to license payments  to use Farnsworth s patents   In 1933 RCA introduced an improved camera tube that relied on Tihanyi s charge storage principle  Dubbed the Iconoscope by Zworykin  the new tube had a light sensitivity of about 75 000 lux  and thus was claimed to be much more sensitive than Farnsworth s image dissector  However  Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his Image Dissector through the invention of a completely unique  multipactor  device that he began work on in 1930  and demonstrated in 1931  This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics  A problem with the multipactor  unfortunately  was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate   At the Berlin Radio Show in August 1931  Manfred von Ardenne gave a public demonstration of a television system using a CRT for both transmission and reception  However  Ardenne had not developed a camera tube  using the CRT instead as a flying spot scanner to scan slides and film  Philo Farnsworth gave the world s first public demonstration of an all electronic television system  using a live camera  at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia on August 25  1934  and for ten days afterwards   Mexican inventor Guillermo González Camarena also played an important role in early TV  His experiments with TV  known as telectroescopía at first  began in 1931 and led to a patent for the  trichromatic field sequential system  color television in 1940   In Britain the EMI engineering team led by Isaac Shoenberg applied in 1932 for a patent for a new device they dubbed  the Emitron   which formed the heart of the cameras they designed for the BBC  On November 2  1936  a 405 line broadcasting service employing the Emitron began at studios in Alexandra Palace  and transmitted from a specially built mast atop one of the Victorian building s towers  It alternated for a short time with Baird s mechanical system in adjoining studios  but was more reliable and visibly superior  This was the world s first regular high definition television service   The original American iconoscope was noisy  had a high ratio of interference to signal  and ultimately gave disappointing results  especially when compared to the high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available  The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the iconoscope  or Emitron  produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum  They solved this problem by developing and patenting in 1934 two new camera tubes dubbed super Emitron and CPS Emitron  The super Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and  in some cases  this ratio was considerably greater  It was used for an outside broadcasting by the BBC  for the first time  on Armistice Day 1937  when the general public could watch in a television set how the King lay a wreath at the Cenotaph  This was the first time that anyone could broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighbor buildings  because neither Farnsworth nor RCA could do the same before the 1939 New York World s Fair  On the other hand  in 1934  Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German licensee company Telefunken  The  image iconoscope    Superikonoskop  in Germany  was produced as a result of the collaboration  This tube is essentially identical to the super Emitron  The production and commercialization of the super Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth  because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector  having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher  Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television  in Germany in 1925  two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States  The image iconoscope  Superikonoskop  became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960  when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes  Indeed it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon  The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games  later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955  finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958   American television broadcasting at the time consisted of a variety of markets in a wide range of sizes  each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology  until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941  RCA  for example  used only Iconoscopes in the New York area  but Farnsworth Image Dissectors in Philadelphia and San Francisco  In September 1939  RCA agreed to pay the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation royalties over the next ten years for access to Farnsworth s patents  With this historic agreement in place  RCA integrated much of what was best about the Farnsworth Technology into their systems  In 1941  the United States implemented 525 line television   The world s first 625 line television standard was designed in the Soviet Union in 1944  and became a national standard in 1946  The first broadcast in 625 line standard occurred in 1948 in Moscow  The concept of 625 lines per frame was subsequently implemented in the European CCIR standard   In 1936  Kálmán Tihanyi described the principle of plasma display  the first flat panel display system   2 3  Color television  The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black and white televisions had first been built  Among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc in 1880 for a color system  including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning  although he gave no practical details  Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897  using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver  But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end  and could not have worked as he described it  Another inventor  Hovannes Adamian  also experimented with color television as early as 1907  The first color television project is claimed by him  and was patented in Germany on March 31  1908  patent № 197183  then in Britain  on April 1  1908  patent № 7219  in France  patent № 390326  and in Russia in 1910  patent № 17912    Scottish inventor John Logie Baird demonstrated the world s first color transmission on July 3  1928  using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures  each spiral with filters of a different primary color  and three light sources at the receiving end  with a commutator to alternate their illumination  Baird also made the world s first color broadcast on February 4  1938  sending a mechanically scanned 120 line image from Baird s Crystal Palace studios to a projection screen at London s Dominion Theatre   Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by Bell Laboratories in June 1929 using three complete systems of photoelectric cells  amplifiers  glow tubes  and color filters  with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red  green  and blue images into one full color image   The first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird  In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black and white display with a rotating colored disk  This device was very  deep   but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console  However  Baird was not happy with the design  and as early as 1944 had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better   In 1939  Hungarian engineer Peter Carl Goldmark introduced an electro mechanical system while at CBS  which contained an Iconoscope sensor  The CBS field sequential color system was partly mechanical  with a disc made of red  blue  and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1 200 rpm  and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set  The system was first demonstrated to the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  on August 29  1940  and shown to the press on September 4   CBS began experimental color field tests using film as early as August 28  1940  and live cameras by November 12  NBC  owned by RCA  made its first field test of color television on February 20  1941  CBS began daily color field tests on June 1  1941  These color systems were not compatible with existing black and white television sets  and as no color television sets were available to the public at this time  viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press  The War Production Board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 22  1942 to August 20  1945  limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public   As early as 1940  Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the  Telechrome   Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate  The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other  Using cyan and magenta phosphors  a reasonable limited color image could be obtained  He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image  called  stereoscopic  at the time   A demonstration on August 16  1944 was the first example of a practical color television system  Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three gun version for full color  However  Baird s untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system   Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 50s  differing primarily in the way they re combined the colors generated by the three guns  The Geer tube was similar to Baird s concept  but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces  instead of Baird s 3D patterning on a flat surface  The Penetron used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors  The Chromatron used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube   One of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth  potentially three times that of the existing black and white standards  and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum  In the United States  after considerable research  the National Television Systems Committee approved an all electronic Compatible color system developed by RCA  which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth  The brightness image remained compatible with existing black and white television sets at slightly reduced resolution  while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited resolution color display  The higher resolution black and white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high resolution color image  The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement   Although all electronic color was introduced in the U S  in 1953  high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace  The first national color broadcast  the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade  occurred on January 1  1954  but during the following ten years most network broadcasts  and nearly all local programming  continued to be in black and white  It was not until the mid 1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers  due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime time programming would be broadcast in color that fall  The first all color prime time season came just one year later   Early color sets were either floor standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy  so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place  The introduction of GE s relatively compact and lightweight Porta Color set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition  In 1972  sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black and white sets  Also in 1972  the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color  resulting in the first completely all color network season   Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s  and broadcasts did not start until 1967  By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out  and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid   By the mid 1970s  the only stations broadcasting in black and white were a few high numbered UHF stations in small markets  and a handful of low power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots  By 1979  even the last of these had converted to color and by the early 1980s B&W sets had been pushed into niche markets  notably low power uses  small portable sets  or use as video monitor screens in lower cost consumer equipment  By late 1980 s even these areas switched to color sets   2 4  Digital television  Digital television  DTV  is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signal  in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by analog television  Digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth  It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s  All countries have replaced or replacing analog television with digital television and allowing other uses of the television radio spectrum  Several regions of the world are in different stages of adaptation and are implementing different broadcasting standards  Below are the different widely used digital television broadcasting standards  DTB    Digital Video Broadcasting  DVB  uses coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  OFDM  modulation and supports hierarchical transmission  This standard has been adopted in Europe  Australia and New Zealand   Advanced Television System Committee  ATSC  uses eight level vestigial sideband  8VSB  for terrestrial broadcasting  This standard has been adopted by six countries  United States  Canada  Mexico  South Korea  Dominican Republic and Honduras   Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting  ISDB  is a system designed to provide good reception to fix receivers and also portable or mobile receivers  It utilizes OFDM and two dimensional interleaving  It supports hierarchical transmission of up to three layers and uses MPEG 2 video and Advanced Audio Coding  This standard has been adopted in Japan and the Philippines  ISDB T International is an adaptation of this standard using H 264 MPEG 4 AVC that been adopted in most of South America and is also being embraced by Portuguese speaking African countries   Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting  DTMB  adopts time domain synchronous  TDS  OFDM technology with a pseudo random signal frame to serve as the guard interval  GI  of the OFDM block and the training symbol  The DTMB standard has been adopted in the People s Republic of China  including Hong Kong and Macau   Digital Multimedia Broadcasting  DMB  is a digital radio transmission technology developed in South Korea as part of the national IT project for sending multimedia such as TV  radio and datacasting to mobile devices such as mobile phones  laptops and GPS navigation systems   3  Broadcast Systems  3 1  Terrestrial television  Programming is broadcast by television stations  sometimes called  channels   as stations are licensed by their governments to broadcast only over assigned channels in the television band  At first  terrestrial broadcasting was the only way television could be widely distributed  and because bandwidth was limited  i e   there were only a small number of channels available  government regulation was the norm   In the U S   the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941  but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license  By contrast  the United Kingdom chose a different route  imposing a television license fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the British Broadcasting Corporation  BBC   which had public service as part of its Royal Charter   WRGB claims to be the world s oldest television station  tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928  broadcasting from the General Electric factory in Schenectady  NY  under the call letters W2XB  It was popularly known as  WGY Television  after its sister radio station  Later in 1928  General Electric started a second facility  this one in New York City  which had the call letters W2XBS and which today is known as WNBC  The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming  as receivers were operated by engineers within the company  The image of a Felix the Cat doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers   On 2 November 1936  the BBC began transmitting the world s first public regular high definition service from the Victorian Alexandra Palace in north London  It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today   With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s  terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline  in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna  A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to swichover to digital terrestrial television broadcasts  which offer pristine image quality over very large areas  and offered an alternate to CATV for cord cutters   All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television   3 2  Cable television  Cable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency  RF  signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber optic cables  This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television  in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television  FM radio programming  high speed Internet  telephone service  and similar non television services may also be provided through these cables   The abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television  It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television  from cable television s origins in 1948  in areas where over the air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain  large  community antennas  were constructed  and cable was run from them to individual homes  The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924   Earlier cable television was analog  but since 2000s all cable operators have switched to or are in process of switching to digital cable television   3 3  Satellite television  Satellite television is a system of supplying television programming using broadcast signals relayed from communication satellites  The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a satellite dish and a low noise block downconverter  LNB   A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television programme for viewing on a television set  Receivers can be external set top boxes  or a built in television tuner  Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services  especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television   The most common method of reception is direct broadcast satellite television  DBSTV   also known as  direct to home   DTH   In DBSTV systems  signals are relayed from a direct broadcast satellite on the Ku wavelength and are completely digital  Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as television receive only  These systems received analog signals transmitted in the C band spectrum from FSS type satellites  and required the use of large dishes  Consequently these systems were nicknamed  big dish  systems  and were more expensive and less popular   The direct broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals  both of which require a compatible receiver  Digital signals may include high definition television  HDTV   Some transmissions and channels are free to air or free to view  while many other channels are pay television requiring a subscription  In 1945 British science fiction writer Arthur C  Clarke proposed a world wide communications system which would function by means of three satellites equally spaced apart in earth orbit  This was published in the October 1945 issue of the Wireless World magazine and won him the Franklin Institute s Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1963   The first satellite television signals from Europe to North America were relayed via the Telstar satellite over the Atlantic ocean on 23 July 1962  The signals were received and broadcast in North American and European countries and watched by over 100 million  Launched in 1962  the Relay 1 satellite was the first satellite to transmit television signals from the US to Japan  The first geosynchronous communication satellite  Syncom 2  was launched on 26 July 1963   The world s first commercial communications satellite  called Intelsat I and nicknamed  Early Bird   was launched into geosynchronous orbit on April 6  1965  The first national network of television satellites  called Orbita  was created by the Soviet Union in October 1967  and was based on the principle of using the highly elliptical Molniya satellite for rebroadcasting and delivering of television signals to ground downlink stations  The first commercial North American satellite to carry television transmissions was Canada s geostationary Anik 1  which was launched on 9 November 1972  ATS 6  the world s first experimental educational and Direct Broadcast Satellite  DBS   was launched on 30 May 1974  It transmitted at 860 MHz using wideband FM modulation and had two sound channels  The transmissions were focused on the Indian subcontinent but experimenters were able to receive the signal in Western Europe using home constructed equipment that drew on UHF television design techniques already in use   The first in a series of Soviet geostationary satellites to carry Direct To Home television  Ekran 1  was launched on 26 October 1976  It used a 714 MHz UHF downlink frequency so that the transmissions could be received with existing UHF television technology rather than microwave technology   4  Television sets  A television set  also called a television receiver  television  TV set  TV  or telly  is a device that combines a tuner  display  and speakers for the purpose of viewing television  Introduced in late 1920 s in mechanical form  television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form  using cathode ray tubes  The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in 1960 s  and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes  The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s  such as VHS and later DVD  It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers  e g   Timex Sinclair 1000  and video game consoles  e g   Atari  in the 1980s  Televisions since late 2010s use LCDs especially LED backlit LCD displays  this is mostly used  and OLED   4 1  Display technologies  4 1 1  Spinning disk  Earliest systems were mechanical systems which employed a spinning disk to create images  These usually had a low resolution and screen size and were not popular with the public   4 1 2  CRT  The cathode ray tube  CRT  is a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns  a source of electrons or electron emitter  and a fluorescent screen used to view images  It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam s  onto the screen to create the images  The images may represent electrical waveforms  oscilloscope   pictures  television  computer monitor   radar targets or others  The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large  deep  i e  long from front screen face to rear end   fairly heavy  and relatively fragile  As a matter of safety  the face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be highly shatter resistant and to block most X ray emissions  particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product   In television sets and computer monitors  the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster  An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams  one for each additive primary color  red  green  and blue  with a video signal as a reference  In all modern CRT monitors and televisions  the beams are bent by magnetic deflection  a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube  although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes  a type of diagnostic instrument   Larger CRT televisions  particularly those used in family sitting rooms in the 1980s  have been referred to as  Live Aid TVs   given that the two billion people who watched the 1985 event would have in most cases used CRT sets to do so   4 1 3  DLP  Digital Light Processing  DLP  is a type of projector technology that uses a digital micromirror device  Some DLPs have a TV tuner  which makes them a type of TV display  It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr  Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments  While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments  the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997  Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for the DLP projector technology  DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non traditional embedded applications including medical  security  and industrial uses   DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors  standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily   DLP rear projection television sets  and digital signs  It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection  and in additive manufacturing as a power source in some printers to cure resins into solid 3D objects   4 1 4  Plasma  A plasma display panel  PDP  is a type of flat panel display common to large TV displays or larger  They are called  plasma  displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases  or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as fluorescent lamps   4 1 5  LCD  Liquid crystal display televisions  LCD TV  are television sets that use LCD display technology to produce images  LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than cathode ray tube  CRTs  of similar display size  and are available in much larger sizes  e g   90 inch diagonal   When manufacturing costs fell  this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers   In 2007  LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT based televisions worldwide for the first time  and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated  LCD TVs have quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large screen market  the plasma display panel and rear projection television  In mid 2010 s LCDs became  by far  the most widely produced and sold television display type   LCDs also have disadvantages  Other technologies address these weaknesses  including OLEDs  FED and SED  but none of these have entered widespread production   4 1 6  OLED  An OLED  organic light emitting diode  is a light emitting diode  LED  in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current  This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes  Generally  at least one of these electrodes is transparent  OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens  It is also used for computer monitors  portable systems such as mobile phones  handheld games consoles and PDAs   There are two main families of OLED  those based on small molecules and those employing polymers  Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light emitting electrochemical cell or LEC  which has a slightly different mode of operation  OLED displays can use either passive matrix  PMOLED  or active matrix addressing schemes  Active matrix OLEDs  AMOLED  require a thin film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off  but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes   An OLED display works without a backlight  Thus  it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display  LCD   In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD  whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight   4 2  Display resolution  4 2 1  LD  Low definition television or LDTV refers to television systems that have a lower screen resolution than standard definition television systems such 240p  320*240   They are used in handheld television   4 2 2  SD  Standard definition television or SDTV refers to two different resolutions  576i  with 576 interlaced lines of resolution  derived from the European developed PAL and SECAM systems  and 480i based on the American National Television System Committee NTSC system   4 2 3  HD  High definition television  HDTV  provides a resolution that is substantially higher than that of standard definition television   HDTV may be transmitted in various formats   1080p  1920×1080p  2 073 600 pixels  ~2 07 megapixels  per frame  1080i  1920×1080i  1 036 800 pixels  ~1 04 MP  per field or 2 073 600 pixels  ~2 07 MP  per frame  A non standard CEA resolution exists in some countries such as 1440×1080i  777 600 pixels  ~0 78 MP  per field or 1 555 200 pixels  ~1 56 MP  per frame  720p  1280×720p  921 600 pixels  ~0 92 MP  per frame  4 2 4  UHD  Ultra high definition television  also known as Super Hi Vision  Ultra HD television  UltraHD  UHDTV  or UHD  includes 4K UHD  2160p  and 8K UHD  4320p   which are two digital video formats proposed by NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories and defined and approved by the International Telecommunication Union  ITU    The Consumer Electronics Association announced on October 17  2012  that  Ultra High Definition   or  Ultra HD   would be used for displays that have an aspect ratio of at least 16 9 and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of 3840×2160 pixels   4 3  Sales  North American consumers purchase a new television set on average every seven years  and the average household owns 2 8 televisions    48 million are sold each year at an average price of $460 and size of   In 2014  most of the TV sets sold were LCDs mainly LED backlit LCD displays  Major TV manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT  RPTV  plasma and even fluorescent backlit LCDs in 2014   Note  Vendor shipments are branded shipments and exclude OEM sales for all vendors  5  Content  5 1  Programming  Getting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways  After production  the next step is to market and deliver the product to whichever markets are open to using it  This typically happens on two levels   Original Run or First Run  a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the television producers to do the same   Broadcast syndication  this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages  beyond original run   It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer  In many cases  other companies  TV stations  or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work  in other words  to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders  in most cases the producers  First run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the US  but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic free to air  FTA  elsewhere  This practice is increasing however  generally on digital only FTA channels or with subscriber only first run material appearing on FTA   Unlike the US  repeat FTA screenings of an FTA network program usually only occur on that network  Also  affiliates rarely buy or produce non network programming that is not centered around local programming   5 2  Genres  Television genres include a broad range of programming types that entertain  inform  and educate viewers  The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic miniseries  However  other genres  such as historical Western genres  may also have high production costs   Popular culture entertainment genres include action oriented shows such as police  crime  detective dramas  horror  or thriller shows  As well  there are also other variants of the drama genre  such as medical dramas and daytime soap operas  Science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category  depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure  Comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy  sitcom  and animated shows for the adult demographic such as South Park   The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows  talk shows  variety shows  and reality television  Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes  Talk shows contain interviews with film  television  and music celebrities and public figures  Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers  such as comedians and magicians  introduced by a host or Master of Ceremonies  There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands  singers  comedians  and other performers in between the interview segments  Reality TV shows  regular  people  i e   not actors  facing unusual challenges or experiences ranging from arrest by police officers  COPS  to weight loss  The Biggest Loser   A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life  The Osbournes  Snoop Dogg s Father Hood  or doing manual labor  The Simple Life    Fictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are  quality television  include series such as Twin Peaks and The Sopranos  Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in art films  such as psychological realism  narrative complexity  and ambiguous plotlines  Nonfiction television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are  quality television  include a range of serious  noncommercial programming aimed at a niche audience  such as documentaries and public affairs shows   5 3  Funding  Around the globe  broadcast TV is financed by government  advertising  licensing  a form of tax   subscription  or any combination of these  To protect revenues  subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal  Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA   In 2009  the global TV market represented 1 217 2 million TV households with at least one TV and total revenues of 268 9 billion EUR  declining 1 2% compared to 2008   North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39% followed by Europe  31%   Asia Pacific  21%   Latin America  8%   and Africa and the Middle East  2%    Globally  the different TV revenue sources divide into 45% 50% TV advertising revenues  40% 45% subscription fees and 10% public funding   5 3 1  Advertising  TV s broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers  Many TV networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers   sponsors   to fund their programming   5 3 1 1  United States  Since inception in the US in 1941  television commercials have become one of the most effective  persuasive  and popular methods of selling products of many sorts  especially consumer goods  During the 1940s and into the 1950s  programs were hosted by single advertisers  This  in turn  gave great creative license to the advertisers over the content of the show  Perhaps due to the quiz show scandals in the 1950s  networks shifted to the magazine concept  introducing advertising breaks with multiple advertisers   US advertising rates are determined primarily by Nielsen ratings  The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a TV commercial can cost  For example  it can cost approximately $750 000 for a 30 second block of commercial time during the highly popular American Idol  while the same amount of time for the Super Bowl can cost several million dollars  Conversely  lesser viewed time slots  such as early mornings and weekday afternoons  are often sold in bulk to producers of infomercials at far lower rates   In recent years  the paid program or infomercial has become common  usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour  Some drug companies and other businesses have even created  news  items for broadcast  known in the industry as video news releases  paying program directors to use them   Some TV programs also weave advertisements into their shows  a practice begun in film and known as product placement  For example  a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda  going to a particular chain restaurant  or driving a certain make of car   This is sometimes very subtle  with shows having vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost rather than wrangling them   Sometimes  a specific brand or trade mark  or music from a certain artist or group  is used   This excludes guest appearances by artists who perform on the show    5 3 1 2  United Kingdom  The TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom  Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV  Despite this  an early TV mogul  Roy Thomson  likened the broadcasting licence as being a  licence to print money   Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels  ITV  Channel 4  and Five can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour  eight minutes in the peak period   Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes  twelve in the peak   This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural pauses where the UK company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent US advertising  Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration  this list includes any news or current affairs programs  documentaries  and programs for children  additionally  advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any religious broadcasting service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion  There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements   The BBC  being strictly non commercial  is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK  although it has many advertising funded channels abroad  The majority of its budget comes from television license fees  see below  and broadcast syndication  the sale of content to other broadcasters   5 3 1 3  Ireland  The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland  BCI     oversees advertising on television and radio within Ireland for both private and state owned broadcasters  There are some restrictions based on advertising  especially in relation to the advertising of alcohol  Such advertisements are prohibited until after 7 pm  Broadcasters in Ireland adhere to broadcasting legislation implemented by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the European Union  Sponsorship of current affairs programming is prohibited at all times   As of 1 October 2009  the responsibilities held by the BCI are gradually being transferred to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland   5 3 2  Subscription  Some TV channels are partly funded from subscriptions  therefore  the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch pay television or specialty channels  Most subscription services are also funded by advertising   5 3 3  Taxation or license  Television services in some countries may be funded by a television licence or a form of taxation  which means that advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all  For example  some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little  including   Australia  ABC   Japan  NHK   Norway  NRK   Sweden  SVT   United Kingdom  BBC   United States  PBS   Denmark  DR  The BBC carries no television advertising on its UK channels and is funded by an annual television licence paid by premises receiving live TV broadcasts  Currently  it is estimated that approximately 26 8 million UK private domestic households own televisions  with approximately 25 million TV licences in all premises in force as of 2010  This television license fee is set by the government  but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government   The two main BBC TV channels are watched by almost 90% of the population each week and overall have 27% share of total viewing  despite the fact that 85% of homes are multichannel  with 42% of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via Freeview  The licence that funds the seven advertising free BBC TV channels currently costs £139 50 a year  about US$215  regardless of the number of TV sets owned  When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels  the BBC always attracts the lion s share of the audience  indicating that viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising   Other than internal promotional material  the Australian Broadcasting Corporation  ABC  carries no advertising  it is banned under the   The ABC receives its funding from the Australian government every three years  In the 2008 09 federal budget  the ABC received A$1 13 billion  The funds provide for the ABC s television  radio  online  and international outputs  The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC shops across Australia  Although funded by the Australian government  the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law   In France  government funded channels carry advertisements  yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax   la redevance audiovisuelle     In Japan  NHK is paid for by license fees  known in Japanese as    The broadcast law that governs NHK s funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay  The fee is standardized  with discounts for office workers and students who commute  as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture   6  Social aspects  Television has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries  There are many aspects of television that can be addressed  including negative issues such as media violence  Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation   Several studies have found that educational television has many advantages  The   explains in its article  The Good Things about Television  that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely   7  Environmental aspects  With high lead content in CRTs and the rapid diffusion of new flat panel display technologies  some of which  LCDs  use lamps which contain mercury  there is growing concern about electronic waste from discarded televisions  Related occupational health concerns exist  as well  for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs  Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices  increasing electrical energy requirements   8  Future  In 2010 the iPlayer incorporated a social media aspect to its internet television service  including Facebook and Twitter  Other devices that allow interactivity   such as the Apple TV  Google TV and Chromecast   have made it possible for users to access content through the internet on their TVs and social media websites like YouTube  Also  the use of the television for video games  especially on consoles such as the Wii  has contributed to a growing kinaesthetic connection between television and viewers   9
