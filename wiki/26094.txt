Romanticism  also the Romantic era or the Romantic period  was an artistic  literary  and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850  Partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution  it was also a revolt against the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature  It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts  music  and literature  but had a major impact on historiography  education and the natural sciences  Its effect on politics was considerable and complex  while for much of the peak Romantic period it was associated with liberalism and radicalism  its long term effect on the growth of nationalism was probably more significant   The movement validated intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience  placing new emphasis on such emotions as apprehension  horror and terror  and awe—especially that which is experienced in confronting the sublimity of untamed nature and its picturesque qualities  both new aesthetic categories  It elevated folk art and ancient custom to a noble status  but also made spontaneity a desirable characteristic  as in the musical impromptu  Romanticism reached beyond the rational and Classicist ideal models to raise a revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth  urban sprawl  and industrialism  Romanticism embraced the exotic  the unfamiliar  and the distant in modes more authentic than Rococo chinoiserie  harnessing the power of the imagination to envision and to escape   Although the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement  which prized intuition and emotion over the rationalism of the Enlightenment  the events of and ideologies that led to the French Revolution planted the seeds from which both Romanticism and the Counter Enlightenment sprouted  As a reaction to the Industrial Revolution  it was in part an escape from modern realities and in the second half of the 19th century   Realism  was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism  Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of  heroic  individualists and artists  whose pioneering examples  it maintained  would raise the quality of society  It also vouched for the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art  There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability  a Zeitgeist  in the representation of its ideas   1  Defining Romanticism  1 1  Basic characteristics  Defining the nature of Romanticism may be approached from the starting point of the primary importance of the free expression of the feelings of the artist  The importance the Romantics placed on untrammelled feeling is summed up in the remark of the German painter Caspar David Friedrich that  the artist s feeling is his law   To William Wordsworth poetry should begin as  the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings   which the poet then  recollect s  in tranquility   evoking thereby a new but corresponding emotion the poet can then mould into art  In order to truly express these feelings  the content of the art must come from the imagination of the artist  with as little interference as possible from  artificial  rules dictating what a work should consist of  Coleridge was not alone in believing that there were natural laws governing these matters which the imagination  at least of a good creative artist  would freely and unconsciously follow through artistic inspiration if left alone to do so  As well as rules  the influence of models from other works would impede the creator s own imagination  so originality was absolutely essential  The concept of the genius  or artist who was able to produce his own original work through this process of  creation from nothingness   is key to Romanticism  and to be derivative was the worst sin  This idea is often called  romantic originality    Not essential to Romanticism  but so widespread as to be normative  was a strong belief and interest in the importance of nature  However this is particularly in the effect of nature upon the artist when he is surrounded by it  preferably alone  In contrast to the usually very social art of the Enlightenment  Romantics were distrustful of the human world  and tended to believe that a close connection with nature was mentally and morally healthy  Romantic art addressed its audiences directly and personally with what was intended to be felt as the personal voice of the artist  So  in literature   much of romantic poetry invited the reader to identify the protagonists with the poets themselves    According to Isaiah Berlin  Romanticism embodied  a new and restless spirit  seeking violently to burst through old and cramping forms  a nervous preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of consciousness  a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable  for perpetual movement and change  an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life  a passionate effort at self assertion both individual and collective  a search after means of expressing an unappeasable yearning for unattainable goals    1 2  Etymology  The group of words with the root  Roman  in the various European languages  such as romance and Romanesque  has a complicated history  but by the middle of the 18th century  romantic  in English and romantique in French were both in common use as adjectives of praise for natural phenomena such as views and sunsets  in a sense close to modern English usage but without the sexual connotation  The application of the term to literature first became common in Germany  where the circle around the Schlegel brothers  critics August and Friedrich  began to speak of romantische Poesie   romantic poetry   in the 1790s  contrasting it with  classic  but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating  Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his Dialogue on Poetry  1800    I seek and find the romantic among the older moderns  in Shakespeare  in Cervantes  in Italian poetry  in that age of chivalry  love and fable  from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived   In both French and German the closeness of the adjective to roman  meaning the fairly new literary form of the novel  had some effect on the sense of the word in those languages  The use of the word did not become general very quickly  and was probably spread more widely in France by its persistent use by Madame de Staël in her De L Allemagne  1813   recounting her travels in Germany  In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the  romantic harp  and  classic lyre   but in 1820 Byron could still write  perhaps slightly disingenuously   I perceive that in Germany  as well as in Italy  there is a great struggle about what they call  Classical  and  Romantic   terms which were not subjects of classification in England  at least when I left it four or five years ago   It is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name  and in 1824 the Académie française took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature   1 3  The period  Unsurprisingly  given its rejection on principle of rules  Romanticism is not easily defined  and the period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought  Margaret Drabble described it in literature as taking place  roughly between 1770 and 1848   and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found  In English literature  M  H  Abrams placed it between 1789  or 1798  this latter a very typical view  and about 1830  perhaps a little later than some other critics  In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different  musical Romanticism  for example  is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910  but in an extreme extension the Four Last Songs of Richard Strauss are described stylistically as  Late Romantic  and were composed in 1946–48  However in most fields the Romantic Period is said to be over by about 1850  or earlier   The early period of the Romantic Era was a time of war  with the French Revolution  1789–1799  followed by the Napoleonic Wars until 1815  These wars  along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them  served as the background for Romanticism  The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795–1805 had  in the words of one of their number  Alfred de Vigny  been  conceived between battles  attended school to the rolling of drums    1 4  Context and place in history  The more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of intellectual history and literary history throughout the 20th century  without any great measure of consensus emerging  That it was part of the Counter Enlightenment  a reaction against the Age of Enlightenment  is generally accepted  Its relationship to the French Revolution which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period  is clearly important  but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions  Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views  but a considerable number always had  or developed  a wide range of conservative views  and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism  as discussed in detail below   In philosophy and the history of ideas  Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the very idea of moral absolutes and agreed values  leading  to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth   and hence not only to nationalism  but also fascism and totalitarianism  with a gradual recovery coming only after the catharsis of World War II  For the Romantics  Berlin says   in the realm of ethics  politics  aesthetics it was the authenticity and sincerity of the pursuit of inner goals that mattered  this applied equally to individuals and groups — states  nations  movements  This is most evident in the aesthetics of romanticism  where the notion of eternal models  a Platonic vision of ideal beauty  which the artist seeks to convey  however imperfectly  on canvas or in sound  is replaced by a passionate belief in spiritual freedom  individual creativity  The painter  the poet  the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature  however ideal  but invent  they do not imitate  the doctrine of mimesis   but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue  these goals represent the self expression of the artist s own unique  inner vision  to set aside which in response to the demands of some  external  voice — church  state  public opinion  family friends  arbiters of taste — is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative  Arthur Lovejoy attempted to demonstrate the difficulty of defining Romanticism in his seminal article  On The Discrimination of Romanticisms  in his Essays in the History of Ideas  1948   some scholars see Romanticism as essentially continuous with the present  some like Robert Hughes see in it the inaugural moment of modernity  and some like Chateaubriand   Novalis  and Samuel Taylor Coleridge see it as the beginning of a tradition of resistance to Enlightenment rationalism—a  Counter Enlightenment — to be associated most closely with German Romanticism  An earlier definition comes from Charles Baudelaire   Romanticism is precisely situated neither in choice of subject nor exact truth  but in the way of feeling    The end of the Romantic era is marked in some areas by a new style of Realism  which affected literature  especially the novel and drama  painting  and even music  through Verismo opera  This movement was led by France  with Balzac and Flaubert in literature and Courbet in painting  Stendhal and Goya were important precursors of Realism in their respective media  However  Romantic styles  now often representing the established and safe style against which Realists rebelled  continued to flourish in many fields for the rest of the century and beyond  In music such works from after about 1850 are referred to by some writers as  Late Romantic  and by others as  Neoromantic  or  Postromantic   but other fields do not usually use these terms  in English literature and painting the convenient term  Victorian  avoids having to characterise the period further   In northern Europe  the Early Romantic visionary optimism and belief that the world was in the process of great change and improvement had largely vanished  and some art became more conventionally political and polemical as its creators engaged polemically with the world as it was  Elsewhere  including in very different ways the United States and Russia  feelings that great change was underway or just about to come were still possible  Displays of intense emotion in art remained prominent  as did the exotic and historical settings pioneered by the Romantics  but experimentation with form and technique was generally reduced  often replaced with meticulous technique  as in the poems of Tennyson or many paintings  If not realist  late 19th century art was often extremely detailed  and pride was taken in adding authentic details in a way that earlier Romantics did not trouble with  Many Romantic ideas about the nature and purpose of art  above all the pre eminent importance of originality  continued to be important for later generations  and often underlie modern views  despite opposition from theorists   2  Romantic literature  In literature  Romanticism found recurrent themes in the evocation or criticism of the past  the cult of  sensibility  with its emphasis on women and children  the heroic isolation of the artist or narrator  and respect for a new  wilder  untrammeled and  pure  nature  Furthermore  several romantic authors  such as Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne  based their writings on the supernatural occult and human psychology  Romanticism tended to regard satire as something unworthy of serious attention  a prejudice still influential today   The precursors of Romanticism in English poetry go back to the middle of the 18th century  including figures such as Joseph Warton  headmaster at Winchester College  and his brother Thomas Warton  professor of Poetry at Oxford University  Joseph maintained that invention and imagination were the chief qualities of a poet  Thomas Chatterton is generally considered to be the first Romantic poet in English  The Scottish poet James Macpherson influenced the early development of Romanticism with the international success of his Ossian cycle of poems published in 1762  inspiring both Goethe and the young Walter Scott  Both Chatterton and Macpherson s work involved elements of fraud  as what they claimed to be earlier literature that they had discovered or compiled was in fact entirely their own work  The Gothic novel  beginning with Horace Walpole s The Castle of Otranto  1764   was an important precursor of one strain of Romanticism  with a delight in horror and threat  and exotic picturesque settings  matched in Walpole s case by his role in the early revival of Gothic architecture  Tristram Shandy  a novel by Laurence Sterne  1759–67  introduced a whimsical version of the anti rational sentimental novel to the English literary public   2 1  Germany  An early German influence came from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  whose 1774 novel The Sorrows of Young Werther had young men throughout Europe emulating its protagonist  a young artist with a very sensitive and passionate temperament  At that time Germany was a multitude of small separate states  and Goethe s works would have a seminal influence in developing a unifying sense of nationalism  Another philosophic influence came from the German idealism of Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling  making Jena  where Fichte lived  as well as Schelling  Hegel  Schiller and the brothers Schlegel  a center for early German Romanticism   Jenaer Romantik    Important writers were Ludwig Tieck  Novalis  Heinrich von Ofterdingen  1799   Heinrich von Kleist and Friedrich Hölderlin  Heidelberg later became a center of German Romanticism  where writers and poets such as Clemens Brentano  Achim von Arnim  and Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff met regularly in literary circles   Important motifs in German Romanticism are travelling  nature  and Germanic myths  The later German Romanticism of  for example  E  T  A  Hoffmann s Der Sandmann  The Sandman   1817  and Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff s Das Marmorbild  The Marble Statue   1819  was darker in its motifs and has gothic elements  The significance to Romanticism of childhood innocence  the importance of imagination  and racial theories all combined to give an unprecedented importance to folk literature  non classical mythology and children s literature  above all in Germany  Brentano and von Arnim were significant literary figures who together published Des Knaben Wunderhorn   The Boy s Magic Horn  or cornucopia   a collection of versified folk tales  in 1806–08  The first collection of Grimms  Fairy Tales by the Brothers Grimm was published in 1812  Unlike the much later work of Hans Christian Andersen  who was publishing his invented tales in Danish from 1835  these German works were at least mainly based on collected folk tales  and the Grimms remained true to the style of the telling in their early editions  though later rewriting some parts  One of the brothers  Jacob  published in 1835 Deutsche Mythologie  a long academic work on Germanic mythology  Another strain is exemplified by Schiller s highly emotional language and the depiction of physical violence in his play The Robbers of 1781   2 2  English literature  In English literature  the key figures of the Romantic movement are considered to be the group of poets including William Wordsworth  Samuel Taylor Coleridge  John Keats  Lord Byron  Percy Bysshe Shelley  and the much older William Blake  followed later by the isolated figure of John Clare  together with such novelists as Walter Scott and Mary Shelley  and the essayists William Hazlitt and Charles Lamb  The publication in 1798 of Lyrical Ballads  with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge  is often held to mark the start of the movement  The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth  and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native Lake District  or the poet s feelings about nature  which were to be more fully developed in his long poem The Prelude  never published in his lifetime  The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism  and the exotic settings that many works featured  In the period when they were writing the Lake Poets were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals  though they were supported by the critic and writer William Hazlitt and others   In contrast Lord Byron and Walter Scott achieved enormous fame and influence throughout Europe with works exploiting the violence and drama of their exotic and historical settings  Goethe called Byron  undoubtedly the greatest genius of our century   Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem The Lay of the Last Minstrel in 1805  followed by the full epic poem Marmion in 1808  Both were set in the distant Scottish past  already evoked in Ossian  Romanticism and Scotland were to have a long and fruitfiul partnership  Byron had equal success with the first part of Childe Harold s Pilgrimage in 1812  followed by four  Turkish tales   all in the form of long poems  starting with The Giaour in 1813  drawing from his Grand Tour which had reached Ottoman Europe  and orientalizing the themes of the Gothic novel in verse  These featured different variations of the  Byronic hero   and his own life contributed a further version  Scott meanwhile was effectively inventing the historical novel  beginning in 1814 with Waverley  set in the 1745 Jacobite Rising  which was an enormous and highly profitable success  followed by over 20 further Waverley Novels over the next 17 years  with settings going back to the Crusades that he had researched to a degree that was new in literature   In contrast to Germany  Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism  and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the French Revolution  whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was  as elsewhere in Europe  a shock to the movement  Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history  Scott was politically a firm Unionist  Several spent much time abroad  and a famous stay on Lake Geneva with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel Frankenstein by Shelley s wife to be Mary Shelley and the novella The Vampyre by Byron s doctor John William Polidori  The lyrics of Robert Burns in Scotland and Thomas Moore  from Ireland but based in London or elsewhere reflected in different ways their countries and the Romantic interest in folk literature  but neither had a fully Romantic approach to life or their work   Though they have modern critical champions such as Georg Lukács  Scott s novels are today more likely to be experienced in the form of the many operas that continued to be based on them over the following decades  such as Donizetti s Lucia di Lammermoor and Vincenzo Bellini s I puritani  both 1835   Byron is now most highly regarded for his short lyrics and his generally unromantic prose writings  especially his letters  and his unfinished satire Don Juan  Unlike many Romantics  Byron s widely publicised personal life appeared to match his work  and his death at 36 in 1824 from disease when helping the Greek War of Independence appeared from a distance to be a suitably Romantic end  entrenching his legend  Keats in 1821 and Shelley in 1822 both died in Italy  Blake  at almost 70  in 1827  and Coleridge largely ceased to write in the 1820s  Wordsworth was by 1820 respectable and highly regarded  holding a government sinecure  but wrote relatively little  In the discussion of English literature  the Romantic period is often regarded as finishing around the 1820s  or sometimes even earlier  although many authors of the succeeding decades were no less committed to Romantic values   The most significant novelist in English during the peak Romantic period  other than Walter Scott  was Jane Austen  whose essentially conservative world view had little in common with her Romantic contemporaries  retaining a strong belief in decorum and social rules  though critics have detected tremors under the surface of some works  especially Mansfield Park  1814  and Persuasion  1817   But around the mid century the undoubtedly Romantic novels of the Yorkshire based Brontë family appeared  in particular Charlotte s Jane Eyre and Emily s Wuthering Heights  which were both published in 1847   Byron  Keats and Shelley all wrote for the stage  but with little success in England  with Shelley s The Cenci perhaps the best work produced  though that was not played in a public theatre in England until a century after his death  Byron s plays  along with dramatisations of his poems and Scott s novels  were much more popular on the Continent  and especially in France  and through these versions several were turned into operas  many still performed today  If contemporary poets had little success on the stage  the period was a legendary one for performances of Shakespeare  and went some way to restoring his original texts and removing the Augustan  improvements  to them  The greatest actor of the period  Edmund Kean  restored the tragic ending to King Lear  Coleridge said that  “Seeing him act was like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning ”  2 3  France  Romanticism was relatively late in developing in French literature  even more so than in the visual arts  The 18th century precursor to Romanticism  the cult of sensibility  had become associated with the Ancien regime  and the French Revolution had been more of an inspiration to foreign writers than those experiencing it at first hand  The first major figure was François René de Chateaubriand  a minor aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution  and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon  with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship  His writings  all in prose  included some fiction  such as his influential novella of exile René  1802   which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero  but mostly contemporary history and politics  his travels  a defence of religion and the medieval spirit  Génie du christianisme 1802   and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous autobiography Mémoires d Outre Tombe   Memoirs from beyond the grave     After the Bourbon Restoration  French Romanticism developed in the lively world of Parisian theatre  with productions of Shakespeare  Schiller  in France a key Romantic author   and adaptations of Scott and Byron alongside French authors  several of whom began to write in the late 1820s  Cliques of pro  and anti Romantics developed  and productions were often accompanied by raucous vocalizing by the two sides  including the shouted assertion by one theatregoer in 1822 that  Shakespeare  c est l aide de camp de Wellington    Shakespeare is Wellington s aide de camp    Alexandre Dumas began as a dramatist  with a series of successes beginning with Henri III et sa cour  1829  before turning to novels that were mostly historical adventures somewhat in the manner of Scott  most famously The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo  both of 1844  Victor Hugo published as a poet in the 1820s before achieving success on the stage with Hernani  a historical drama in a quasi Shakespearian style which had famously riotous performances  themselves as much a spectacle as the play  on its first run in 1830  Like Dumas  he is best known for his novels  and was already writing The Hunchback of Notre Dame  1831   one of the best known works of his long career  The preface to his unperformed play  Cromwell  gives an important manifesto of French Romanticism  stating that  there are no rules  or models   The career of Prosper Mérimée followed a similar pattern  he is now best known as the originator of the story of Carmen  with his novella of 1845  Alfred de Vigny remains best known as a dramatist  with his play on the life of the English poet Chatterton  1835  perhaps his best work   French Romantic poets of the 1830s to 1850s include Alfred de Musset  Gérard de Nerval  Alphonse de Lamartine and the flamboyant Théophile Gautier  whose prolific output in various forms continued until his death in 1872  George Sand took over from Germaine de Staël as the leading female writer  and was a central figure of the Parisian literary scene  famous both for her novels and criticism and her affairs with Chopin and several others   Stendhal is today probably the most highly regarded French novelist of the period  but he stands in a complex relation with Romanticism  and is notable for his penetrating psychological insight into his characters and his realism  qualities rarely prominent in Romantic fiction  As a survivor of the French retreat from Moscow in 1812  fantasies of heroism and adventure had little appeal for him  and like Goya he is often seen as a forerunner of Realism  His most important works are Le Rouge et le Noir  The Red and the Black  1830  and La Chartreuse de Parme  The Charterhouse of Parma  1839    2 4  Russia  Early Russian Romanticism is associated with the writers Konstantin Batyushkov  A Vision on the Shores of the Lethe  1809   Vasily Zhukovsky  The Bard  1811  Svetlana  1813  and Nikolay Karamzin  Poor Liza  1792  Julia  1796  Martha the Mayoress  1802  The Sensitive and the Cold  1803   However the principal exponent of Romanticism in Russia is Alexander Pushkin  The Prisoner of the Caucasus  1820–1821  The Robber Brothers  1822  Ruslan and Ludmila  1820  Eugene Onegin  1825–1832   Pushkin s work influenced many writers in the 19th century and led to his eventual recognition as Russia s greatest poet  Other Russian poets include Mikhail Lermontov  A Hero of Our Time  1839   Fyodor Tyutchev  Silentium   1830   Yevgeny Baratynsky  Eda  1826   Anton Delvig  and Wilhelm Küchelbecker   Influenced heavily by Lord Byron  Lermontov sought to explore the Romantic emphasis on metaphysical discontent with society and self  while Tyutchev s poems often described scenes of nature or passions of love  Tyutchev commonly operated with such categories as night and day  north and south  dream and reality  cosmos and chaos  and the still world of winter and spring teeming with life  Baratynsky s style was fairly classical in nature  dwelling on the models of the previous century   2 5  Catholic Europe  In predominantly Roman Catholic countries Romanticism was less pronounced than in Germany and Britain  and developed later  after the rise of Napoleon  literary romanticism was strongly interconnected with the national revival of smaller or subjugated nations  and wider cultural romanticism was a prologue to the revolutions of 1848 1849   2 5 1  Poland  Romanticism in Poland is often taken to begin with the publication of Adam Mickiewicz s first poems in 1822  and end with the crushing of the January Uprising of 1863 against the Russians  It was strongly marked by interest in Polish history  Polish Romanticism revived the old  Sarmatism  traditions of the szlachta or Polish nobility  Old traditions and customs were revived and portrayed in a positive light in the Polish messianic movement and in works of great Polish poets such as Adam Mickiewicz  Pan Tadeusz   Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński  as well as prose writers such as Henryk Sienkiewicz  This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of the literature of Polish Romanticism period  differentiating it from that of other countries  They had not suffered the loss of national statehood as was the case with Poland   2 5 2  Italy  Romanticism in Italian literature was a minor movement  yet still important  it began officially in 1816 when Mme de Staël wrote an article in the journal Biblioteca italiana called  Sulla maniera e l utilità delle traduzioni   inviting Italian people to reject Neoclassicism and to study new authors from other countries  Before that date  Ugo Foscolo had already published poems anticipating Romantic themes  The most important Romantic writers were Ludovico di Breme  Pietro Borsieri and Giovanni Berchet  Better known authors such as Alessandro Manzoni and Giacomo Leopardi were influenced by Enlightenment as well as by Romanticism and Classicism   2 5 3  Spain  Romanticism in Spanish literature developed a well known literature with a huge variety of poets and playwrights  The most important Spanish poet during this movement was José de Espronceda  After him there were other poets like Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer  Mariano José de Larra and the dramatist José Zorrilla  author of Don Juan Tenorio  Before them may be mentioned the pre romantics José Cadalso and Manuel José Quintana  The plays of Antonio García Gutiérrez were adapted to produce Giuseppe Verdi s operas Il trovatore and Simon Boccanegra  Spanish Romanticism also influenced regional literatures  For example  in Catalonia and in Galicia there was a national boom of writers in the local languages  like the Catalan Jacint Verdaguer and the Galician Rosalía de Castro  the main figures of the national revivalist movements Renaixença and Rexurdimento  respectively   2 5 4  Portugal  Modern Portuguese poetry develops its character from the work of its Romantic epitome  Almeida Garrett  a very prolific writer who helped shape the genre with the masterpiece   s pt Folhas Caídas Folhas Caídas    1853   This late arrival of a truly personal Romantic style would linger on to the beginning of the 20th century  notably through the works of poets such as Alexandre Herculano  Cesário Verde and António Nobre  However  an early Portuguese expression of Romanticism is found already in Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage  especially in his sonnets dated at the end of the 18th century   2 6  South America  South American Romanticism was influenced heavily by Esteban Echeverría  who wrote in the 1830 and 1840s  His writings were influenced by his hatred for the Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas  and filled with themes of blood and terror  using the metaphor of a slaughterhouse to portray the violence of Rosas  dictatorship   Brazilian Romanticism is characterized and divided in three different periods  The first one is basically focused on the creation of a sense of national identity  using the ideal of the heroic Indian  Some examples include José de Alencar  who wrote  Iracema  and  O Guarani   and Gonçalves Dias  renowned by the poem  Canção do Exílio   Song of the Exile   The second period  sometimes called Ultra Romanticism  is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions  involving the melancholy  sadness and despair related to unobtainable love  Goethe and Lord Byron are commonly quoted in these works  The third cycle is marked by social poetry  especially the abolitionist movement  the greatest writer of this period is Castro Alves   2 7  North America  In the United States  at least by 1818 with William Cullen Bryant s  To a Waterfowl   Romantic poetry was being published  American Romantic Gothic literature made an early appearance with Washington Irving s The Legend of Sleepy Hollow  1820  and Rip Van Winkle  1819   followed from 1823 onwards by the Leatherstocking Tales of James Fenimore Cooper  with their emphasis on heroic simplicity and their fervent landscape descriptions of an already exotic mythicized frontier peopled by  noble savages   similar to the philosophical theory of Rousseau  exemplified by Uncas  from The Last of the Mohicans  There are picturesque  local color  elements in Washington Irving s essays and especially his travel books  Edgar Allan Poe s tales of the macabre and his balladic poetry were more influential in France than at home  but the romantic American novel developed fully with the atmosphere and melodrama of Nathaniel Hawthorne s The Scarlet Letter  1850   Later Transcendentalist writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson still show elements of its influence and imagination  as does the romantic realism of Walt Whitman  The poetry of Emily Dickinson—nearly unread in her own time—and Herman Melville s novel Moby Dick can be taken as epitomes of American Romantic literature  By the 1880s  however  psychological and social realism were competing with Romanticism in the novel   2 7 1  Influence of European Romanticism on American writers  The European Romantic movement reached America in the early 19th century  American Romanticism was just as multifaceted and individualistic as it was in Europe  Like the Europeans  the American Romantics demonstrated a high level of moral enthusiasm  commitment to individualism and the unfolding of the self  an emphasis on intuitive perception  and the assumption that the natural world was inherently good  while human society was filled with corruption   Romanticism became popular in American politics  philosophy and art  The movement appealed to the revolutionary spirit of America as well as to those longing to break free of the strict religious traditions of early settlement  The Romantics rejected rationalism and religious intellect  It appealed to those in opposition of Calvinism  which includes the belief that the destiny of each individual is preordained  The Romantic movement gave rise to New England Transcendentalism which portrayed a less restrictive relationship between God and Universe  The new philosophy presented the individual with a more personal relationship with God  Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion  for both privileged feeling over reason  individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom  It often involved a rapturous response to nature  It encouraged the rejection of harsh  rigid Calvinism  and promised a new blossoming of American culture   American Romanticism embraced the individual and rebelled against the confinement of neoclassicism and religious tradition  The Romantic movement in America created a new literary genre that continues to influence American writers  Novels  short stories  and poems replaced the sermons and manifestos of yore  Romantic literature was personal  intense  and portrayed more emotion than ever seen in neoclassical literature  America s preoccupation with freedom became a great source of motivation for Romantic writers as many were delighted in free expression and emotion without so much fear of ridicule and controversy  They also put more effort into the psychological development of their characters  and the main characters typically displayed extremes of sensitivity and excitement   The works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience  partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period  The Romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers   3  Romantic visual arts  In the visual arts  Romanticism first showed itself in landscape painting  where from as early as the 1760s British artists began to turn to wilder landscapes and storms  and Gothic architecture  even if they had to make do with Wales as a setting  Caspar David Friedrich and J  M  W  Turner were born less than a year apart in 1774 and 1775 respectively and were to take German and English landscape painting to their extremes of Romanticism  but both were formed when forms of Romanticism was already strongly present in art  John Constable  born in 1776  stayed closer to the English landscape tradition  but in his largest  six footers  insisted on the heroic status of a patch of the working countryside where he had grown up  a challenge to the traditional hierarchy of genres which relegated landscape painting to a low status  Turner also painted very large landscapes  and above all seascapes  some with contemporary settings and staffage  but others with small figures turning the work into a history painting in the manner of Claude Lorrain  like Salvator Rosa a late Baroque artist whose landscapes had elements that Romantic painters turned to again and again  Friedrich made repeated use of single figures  or features like crosses  set alone amidst a huge landscape   making them images of the transitoriness of human life and the premonition of death    Other groups of artists expressed feelings that verged on the mystical  many very largely abandoning classical drawing and proportions  These included William Blake and Samuel Palmer and the other members of the Ancients in England  and in Germany Philipp Otto Runge  Like Friedrich  none of these artists had significant influence after their deaths for the rest of the 19th century  and were 20th century rediscoveries from obscurity  though Blake was always known as a poet  and Norway s leading painter Johan Christian Dahl was heavily influenced by Friedrich  The Rome based Nazarene movement of German artists  active from 1810  took a very different path  concentrating on medievalizing history paintings with religious and nationalist themes   The arrival of Romanticism in French art was delayed by the strong hold of Neoclassicism on the academies  but from the Napoleonic period it became increasingly popular  initially in the form of history paintings propagandising for the new regime  of which Girodet s Ossian receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes  for Napoleon s Château de Malmaison  was one of the earliest  Girodet s old teacher David was puzzled and disappointed by his pupil s direction  saying   Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting   A new generation of the French school  developed personal Romantic styles  though still concentrating on history painting with a political message  Théodore Géricault  1791–1824  had his first success with The Charging Chasseur  a heroic military figure derived from Rubens  at the Paris Salon of 1812 in the years of the Empire  but his next major completed work  The Raft of the Medusa of 1821  remains the greatest achievement of the Romantic history painting  which in its day had a powerful anti government message   Eugène Delacroix  1798–1863  made his first Salon hits with The Barque of Dante  1822   The Massacre at Chios  1824  and Death of Sardanapalus  1827   The second was a scene from the Greek War of Independence  completed the year Byron died there  and the last was a scene from one of Byron s plays  With Shakespeare  Byron was to provide the subject matter for many other works of Delacroix  who also spent long periods in North Africa  painting colourful scenes of mounted Arab warriors  His Liberty Leading the People  1830  remains  with the Medusa  one of the best known works of French Romantic painting  Both reflected current events  and increasingly  history painting   literally  story painting   a phrase dating back to the Italian Renaissance meaning the painting of subjects with groups of figures  long considered the highest and most difficult form of art  did indeed become the painting of historical scenes  rather than those from religion or mythology   Francisco Goya is today generally regarded as the greatest painter of the Romantic period   the last great painter in whose art thought and observation were balanced and combined to form a faultless unity   But the extent to which he was a Romantic is a complex question  in Spain there was still a struggle to introduce the values of the Enlightenment  in which Goya saw himself as a participant  The demonic and anti rational monsters thrown up by his imagination are only superficially similar to those of the Gothic fantasies of northern Europe  and in many ways he remained wedded to the classicism and realism of his training  as well as looking forward to the Realism of the later 19th century  But he  more than any other artist of the period  exemplified the Romantic values of the expression of the artist s feelings and his personal imaginative world  He also shared with many of the Romantic painters a more free handling of paint  emphasized in the new prominence of the brushstroke and impasto  which tended to be repressed in neoclassicism under a self effacing finish   Sculpture remained largely impervious to Romanticism  probably partly for technical reasons  as the most prestigious material of the day  marble  does not lend itself to expansive gestures  The leading sculptors in Europe  Antonio Canova and Bertel Thorvaldsen  were both based in Rome and firm Neoclassicists  not at all tempted to allow influence from medieval sculpture  which would have been one possible approach to Romantic sculpture  When it did develop  true Romantic sculpture  with the exception of a few artists such as Rudolf Maison rather oddly was missing in Germany  and mainly found in France  with François Rude  best known from his group of the 1830s from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris  David d Angers and Auguste Préault  whose plaster relief entitled Slaughter  which represented the horrors of wars with exacerbated passion  caused so much scandal at the 1834 Salon that Préault was banned from this official annual exhibition for nearly twenty years  In Italy  the most important Romantic sculptor was Lorenzo Bartolini   File El Tres de Mayo  by Francisco de Goya  from Prado thin black margin jpg Francisco Goya  The Third of May 1808  1814 File Theodore

on idealized medieval and Renaissance themes is known as the style Troubadour  a term which rather lacks equivalents for other countries  though the same trends occurred there  Delacroix  Ingres and Richard Parkes Bonington all worked in this style  as did lesser specialists such as Pierre Henri Révoil  1776–1842  and Fleury François Richard  1777–1852   Their pictures are often small  and feature intimate private and anecdotal moments  as well as those of high drama  The lives of great artists such as Raphael were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers  and fictional characters were also depicted  Fleury Richard s Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband  shown in the Paris Salon of 1802  marked the arrival of the style  which lasted until the mid century  before being subsumed into the increasingly academic history painting of artists like Paul Delaroche   Another trend was for very large apocalyptic history paintings  often combining extreme natural events  or divine wrath  with human disaster  attempting to outdo The Raft of the Medusa  and now often drawing comparisons with effects from Hollywood  The leading English artist in the style was John Martin  whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms  and worked his way through the biblical disasters  and those to come in the final days  Other works  including Delacroix s Death of Sardanapalus included larger figures  and these often drew heavily on earlier artists  especially Poussin and Rubens  with extra emotionalism and special effects   Elsewhere in Europe  leading artists adopted Romantic styles  in Russia there were the portraitists Orest Kiprensky and Vasily Tropinin  with Ivan Aivazovsky specializing in marine painting  and in Norway Hans Gude painted secenes of fjords  In Italy Francesco Hayez  1791–1882  was the leading artist of Romanticism in mid 19th century Milan  His long  prolific and extremely successful career saw him begin as a Neoclassical painter  pass right through the Romantic period  and emerge at the other end as a sentimental painter of young women  His Romantic period included many historical pieces of  Troubadour  tendencies  but on a very large scale  that are heavily influenced by Gian Battista Tiepolo and other late Baroque Italian masters   Literary Romanticism had its counterpart in the American visual arts  most especially in the exaltation of an untamed American landscape found in the paintings of the Hudson River School  Painters like Thomas Cole  Albert Bierstadt and Frederic Edwin Church and others often expressed Romantic themes in their paintings  They sometimes depicted ancient ruins of the old world  such as in Fredric Edwin Church’s piece Sunrise in Syria  These works reflected the Gothic feelings of death and decay  They also show the Romantic ideal that Nature is powerful and will eventually overcome the transient creations of men  More often  they worked to distinguish themselves from their European counterparts by depicting uniquely American scenes and landscapes  This idea of an American identity in the art world is reflected in W  C  Bryant’s poem  To Cole  the Painter  Departing for Europe  where Bryant encourages Cole to remember the powerful scenes that can only be found in America   Some American paintings promote the literary idea of the “noble savage”  Such as Albert Bierstadt’s The Rocky Mountains  Lander s Peak  by portraying idealized Native Americans living in harmony with the natural world  Thomas Cole s paintings tend towards allegory  explicit in The Voyage of Life series painted in the early 1840s  showing the stages of life set amidst an awesome and immense nature   File Thomas Cole   The Voyage of Life Childhood  1842

work defines it entirely in terms of  The role of music in the aesthetics of German romanticism   Another French encyclopedia holds that the German temperament generally  can be described as the deep and diverse action of romanticism on German musicians   and that there is only one true representative of Romanticism in French music  Hector Berlioz  while in Italy  the sole great name of musical Romanticism is Giuseppe Verdi   a sort of  Victor  Hugo of opera  gifted with a real genius for dramatic effect   Nevertheless  the huge popularity of German Romantic music led   whether by imitation or by reaction   to an often nationalistically inspired vogue amongst Polish  Hungarian  Russian  Czech  and Scandinavian musicians  successful  perhaps more because of its extra musical traits than for the actual value of musical works by its masters   Although the term  Romanticism  when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850  or else until around 1900  the contemporary application of  romantic  to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation  Indeed  one of the earliest sustained applications of the term to music occurs in 1789  in the Mémoires of André Grétry  This is of particular interest because it is a French source on a subject mainly dominated by Germans  but also because it explicitly acknowledges its debt to Jean Jacques Rousseau  himself a composer  amongst other things  and  by so doing  establishes a link to one of the major influences on the Romantic movement generally  In 1810 E T A  Hoffmann named Mozart  Haydn and Beethoven as  the three masters of instrumental compositions  who  breathe one and the same romantic spirit   He justified his view on the basis of these composers  depth of evocative expression and their marked individuality  In Haydn s music  according to Hoffmann   a child like  serene disposition prevails   while Mozart  in the late E flat major Symphony  for example   leads us into the depths of the spiritual world   with elements of fear  love  and sorrow   a presentiment of the infinite … in the eternal dance of the spheres   Beethoven s music  on the other hand  conveys a sense of  the monstrous and immeasurable   with the pain of an endless longing which  will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions   This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment  Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason  imagery  or any other precise concept  it came to be regarded  first in the writings of Wackenroder and Tieck and later by writers such as Schelling and Wagner  as preeminent among the arts  the one best able to express the secrets of the universe  to evoke the spirit world  infinity  and the absolute   This chronologic agreement of musical and literary Romanticism continued as far as the middle of the 19th century  when Richard Wagner denigrated the music of Meyerbeer and Berlioz as  neoromantic    The Opera  to which we shall now return  has swallowed down the Neoromanticism of Berlioz  too  as a plump  fine flavoured oyster  whose digestion has conferred on it anew a brisk and well to do appearance    It was only toward the end of the 19th century that the newly emergent discipline of Musikwissenschaft  musicology —itself a product of the historicizing proclivity of the age—attempted a more scientific periodization of music history  and a distinction between Viennese Classical and Romantic periods was proposed  The key figure in this trend was Guido Adler  who viewed Beethoven and Franz Schubert as transitional but essentially Classical composers  with Romanticism achieving full maturity only in the post Beethoven generation of Frédéric Chopin  Robert Schumann  Berlioz  and Franz Liszt  From Adler s viewpoint  found in books like Der Stil in der Musik  1911   composers of the New German School and various late 19th century nationalist composers were not Romantics but  moderns  or  realists   by analogy with the fields of painting and literature   and this schema remained prevalent through the first decades of the 20th century   By the second quarter of the 20th century  an awareness that radical changes in musical syntax had occurred during the early 1900s caused another shift in historical viewpoint  and the change of century came to be seen as marking a decisive break with the musical past  This in turn led historians such as Alfred Einstein to extend the musical  Romantic Era  throughout the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th  It has continued to be referred to as such in some of the standard music references such as The Oxford Companion to Music and Grout s History of Western Music but was not unchallenged  For example  the prominent German musicologist Friedrich Blume  the chief editor of the first edition of Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart  1949–86   accepted the earlier position that Classicism and Romanticism together constitute a single period beginning in the middle of the 18th century  but at the same time held that it continued into the 20th century  including such pre–World War II developments as expressionism and neoclassicism  This is reflected in some notable recent reference works such as the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and the new edition of Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart  File Barabas liszt jpg Franz Liszt  1847 File Eugène Ferdinand Victor

In the contemporary music culture  the romantic musician followed a public career depending on sensitive middle class audiences rather than on a courtly patron  as had been the case with earlier musicians and composers  Public persona characterized a new generation of virtuosi who made their way as soloists  epitomized in the concert tours of Paganini and Liszt  and the conductor began to emerge as an important figure  on whose skill the interpretation of the increasingly complex music depended   5  Romanticism outside the arts  5 1  Sciences  The Romantic movement affected most aspects of intellectual life  and Romanticism and science had a powerful connection  especially in the period 1800–40  Many scientists were influenced by versions of the Naturphilosophie of Johann Gottlieb Fichte  Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and others  and without abandoning empiricism  sought in their work to uncover what they tended to believe was a unified and organic Nature  The English scientist Sir Humphry Davy  a prominent Romantic thinker  said that understanding nature required “an attitude of admiration  love and worship   …  a personal response ” He believed that knowledge was only attainable by those who truly appreciated and respected nature  Self understanding was an important aspect of Romanticism  It had less to do with proving that man was capable of understanding nature  through his budding intellect  and therefore controlling it  and more to do with the emotional appeal of connecting himself with nature and understanding it through a harmonious co existence   5 2  Historiography  History writing was very strongly  and many would say harmfully  influenced by Romanticism  In England Thomas Carlyle was a highly influential essayist who turned historian  he both invented and exemplified the phrase  hero worship   lavishing largely uncritical praise on strong leaders such as Oliver Cromwell  Frederick the Great and Napoleon  Romantic nationalism had a largely negative effect on the writing of history in the 19th century  as each nation tended to produce its own version of history  and the critical attitude  even cynicism  of earlier historians was often replaced by a tendency to create romantic stories with clearly distinguished heroes and villains  Nationalist ideology of the period placed great emphasis on racial coherence  and the antiquity of peoples  and tended to vastly over emphasize the continuity between past periods and the present  leading to national mysticism  Much historical effort in the 20th century was devoted to combating the romantic historical myths created in the 19th century   5 3  Theology  To insulate theology from reductionism in science  19th century post Enlightenment German theologians moved in a new direction  led by Friedrich Schleiermacher and Albrecht Ritschl  They took the Romantic approach of rooting religion in the inner world of the human spirit  so that it is a person s feeling or sensibility about spiritual matters that comprises religion   6  Romantic nationalism  One of Romanticism s key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism  which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy  From the earliest parts of the movement  with their focus on development of national languages and folklore  and the importance of local customs and traditions  to the movements which would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self determination of nationalities  nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism  its role  expression and meaning  One of the most important functions of medieval references in the 19th century was nationalist  Popular and epic poetry were its workhorses  This is visible in Germany and Ireland  where underlying Germanic or Celtic substrates dating from before the Romanisation Latinisation were sought out  And  in Catalonia  which reclaimed Catalanism from before the Hispanicization of the Catholic Monarchs in the 15th century  when the Crown of Aragon was unified with the Castilian nobility   Early Romantic nationalism was strongly inspired by Rousseau  and by the ideas of Johann Gottfried von Herder  who in 1784 argued that the geography formed the natural economy of a people  and shaped their customs and society   The nature of nationalism changed dramatically  however  after the French Revolution with the rise of Napoleon  and the reactions in other nations  Napoleonic nationalism and republicanism were  at first  inspirational to movements in other nations  self determination and a consciousness of national unity were held to be two of the reasons why France was able to defeat other countries in battle  But as the French Republic became Napoleon s Empire  Napoleon became not the inspiration for nationalism  but the object of its struggle  In Prussia  the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in the struggle against Napoleon was argued by  among others  Johann Gottlieb Fichte  a disciple of Kant  The word Volkstum  or nationality  was coined in German as part of this resistance to the now conquering emperor  Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his address  To the German Nation  in 1806   Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself  long before any human art begins  they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly  they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole     Only when each people  left to itself  develops and forms itself in accordance with its own peculiar quality  and only when in every people each individual develops himself in accordance with that common quality  as well as in accordance with his own peculiar quality—then  and then only  does the manifestation of divinity appear in its true mirror as it ought to be  This view of nationalism inspired the collection of folklore by such people as the Brothers Grimm  the revival of old epics as national  and the construction of new epics as if they were old  as in the Kalevala  compiled from Finnish tales and folklore  or Ossian  where the claimed ancient roots were invented  The view that fairy tales  unless contaminated from outside literary sources  were preserved in the same form over thousands of years  was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists  but fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people  For instance  the Brothers Grimm rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by Charles Perrault  which they thought proved they were not truly German tales  Sleeping Beauty survived in their collection because the tale of Brynhildr convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German   Romanticism played an essential role in the national awakening of many Central European peoples lacking their own national states  not least in Poland  which had recently lost its independence when Russia s army crushed the Polish Uprising under Nicholas I  Revival and reinterpretation of ancient myths  customs and traditions by Romantic poets and painters helped to distinguish their indigenous cultures from those of the dominant nations and crystallise the mythography of Romantic nationalism  Patriotism  nationalism  revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period  Arguably  the most distinguished Romantic poet of this part of Europe was Adam Mickiewicz  who developed an idea that Poland was the Messiah of Nations  predestined to suffer just as Jesus had suffered to save all the people   7  Gallery   Emerging Romanticism in the 18th century File Shipwrec vernet jpg Joseph Vernet  1759  Shipwreck  the 18th century  sublime  File Joseph Wright 004 jpg
