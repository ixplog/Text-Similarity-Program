This list includes distances between 1 and 10 exametres (1018 m). To help compare different distances this page lists lengths between 1018 m (1 Em or 105.7 light years) and 1019 m (1057 light years).

Distances shorter than 1 Em

1.6 Em — 172 ± 12.5 light years — Diameter of Omega Centauri (one of the largest known globular clusters, perhaps containing over a million stars)

6.1 Em — 640 light years — Distance to Betelgeuse according to Hipparcos

Distances longer than 10 Em
