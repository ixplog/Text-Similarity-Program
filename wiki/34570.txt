The 18th century lasted from January 1  1701 to December 31  1800 in the Gregorian calendar   During the 18th century  the Enlightenment culminated in the French and American revolutions  Philosophy and science increased in prominence  Philosophers dreamed of a brighter age  This dream turned into a reality with the French Revolution  although it was later compromised by the excesses of the Reign of Terror of Maximilien Robespierre  At first  the monarchies of Europe embraced Enlightenment ideals  but with the French Revolution they feared losing their power and formed broad coalitions for the counter revolution   The Ottoman Empire underwent a protracted decline  as it failed to keep up with the technological advances in Europe  The Tulip period symbolized a period of peace and reorientation towards European society  after victory against a burgeoning Russian Empire in the Pruth River Campaign  Throughout the century various reforms were introduced with limited success   The 18th century also marked the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as an independent state  The once powerful and vast kingdom  that was once able to conquer Moscow and defeat the great Ottoman armies  collapsed under numerous invasions  Its semi democratic government system was not robust enough to rival the neighbouring monarchies of the Kingdom of Prussia  the Russian Empire and the Archduchy of Austria which divided the Commonwealth territories among them  changing the landscape of Central European politics for the next hundred years   Great Britain became a major power worldwide with the defeat of France in the Americas in the 1760s  and the conquest of large parts of India  However  Britain lost much of its North American colonies after the American Revolution  which was actively helped by the French  The Industrial Revolution started in Britain in the 1770s with the production of the improved steam engine  Despite its modest beginnings in the 18th century  it would radically change human society and the environment   Western historians have occasionally defined the 18th century otherwise for the purposes of their work  For example  the  short  18th century may be defined as 1715–1789  denoting the period of time between the death of Louis XIV of France and the start of the French Revolution with an emphasis on directly interconnected events  To historians who expand the century to include larger historical movements  the  long  18th century may run from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 or even later   1
