Marcos Orlando Letelier del Solar  April 13  1932 – September 21  1976  was a Chilean economist  Socialist politician and diplomat during the presidency of Socialist President Salvador Allende  As a refugee from the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet  Letelier accepted several academic positions in Washington  D C   where he was assassinated by Pinochet s DINA agents in 1976   1  Background  Letelier was born in Temuco  Chile  the youngest child of Orlando Letelier Ruiz and Inés del Solar  He studied at the Instituto Nacional and  at the age of sixteen  he was accepted as a cadet of the Chilean Military Academy  where he completed his secondary studies  Later he abandoned the military life to attend the University of Chile  where he graduated as a lawyer in 1954  In 1955  he joined the recently formed Copper Office  Departamento del Cobre  now CODELCO   where he worked until 1959 as a research analyst in the copper industry  In that year  Orlando Letelier was fired for supporting Salvador Allende s unsuccessful second presidential campaign  The Letelier family had to leave for Venezuela  where he became a copper consultant for the Finance Ministry  From there  Letelier made his way to the then recently created Inter American Development Bank  where he eventually became senior economist and director of the loan division  He was also one of the United Nations consultants responsible for the establishment of the Asian Development Bank   Letelier married Isabel Margarita Morel Gumucio on December 17  1955  with whom he had four children  Cristián  José  Francisco  and Juan Pablo   2  Political career  Letelier s first political participations were as a university student  when he became a student representative at the University of Chile s Student Union  In 1959 Letelier joined the Chilean Socialist Party  PS   In 1971 President Allende appointed him ambassador to the United States because he had some unique leadership qualities rare among Latin American socialists of the time  chiefly among them a sophisticated grasp of the complexities of US politics and an in depth knowledge of the copper industry  His specific mission was to try to defend the Chilean nationalization of copper against the privatization favored by the US government   During 1973  Letelier was recalled to Chile and served successively as minister of Foreign Affairs  Interior and Defense  In the coup d état of September 11  1973  he was the first high ranking member of the Allende administration seized and arrested  when he arrived at his office at the Ministry of Defense  He was held for twelve months in different concentration camps suffering severe torture  first at the Tacna Regiment  then at the Military Academy  later he was sent for eight months to a political prison on Dawson Island and from there he was transferred to the basement of the Air Force War Academy  and finally to the concentration camp of Ritoque  until international diplomatic pressure  especially from Diego Arria  then Governor of the city of Caracas in Venezuela  resulted in the sudden release of Letelier on the condition that he immediately leave Chile   After his release in September 1974  he and his family resettled in Caracas  but then Letelier decided to head for Washington D C   at the proposal of American writer Saul Landau  In 1975 Letelier moved to Washington where he became senior fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies  IPS is an independent research institute based in Washington  D C   devoted to international policy studies   where Landau worked at the time  He also became director of the Transnational Institute  TNI is an independent research institute based in Amsterdam   and taught at the School of International Service of the American University  in Washington  D C  He plunged into writing  speaking and lobbying the US Congress and European governments against Augusto Pinochet s regime  and soon became the leading voice of the Chilean resistance  preventing several loans  especially from Europe  from being awarded to the military government  On September 10  1976  he was deprived of his Chilean nationality by decree   3  Assassination  Letelier was killed by a car bomb explosion on September 21  1976  in Sheridan Circle  along with his US co worker  Ronni Karpen Moffitt  Her husband Michael Moffitt  was injured but survived  Several people were prosecuted and convicted for the murder  Among them were Michael Townley  a U S  expatriate working for DINA  General Manuel Contreras  former head of the DINA  and Brigadier Pedro Espinoza  also formerly of DINA  Townley was convicted in the United States in 1978 and served 62 months in prison for the murder  he is now free as a participant in the United States Federal Witness Protection Program  Contreras and Espinoza were convicted in Chile in 1993  General Augusto Pinochet  who died on December 10  2006  was never brought to trial for the murders  despite evidence implicating him as having ordered them   4  Aftermath  Following the death of Pinochet in December 2006  the Institute for Policy Studies  IPS   for which both Letelier and Moffitt worked  called for the release of all the classified documents related to the Letelier–Moffitt assassination   According to the IPS  the Clinton administration de classified more than 16 000 documents related to Chile  but withheld documents related to the Letelier Moffitt assassination in Washington on the grounds that they were associated with an ongoing investigation  The IPS says that the Clinton administration did re activate the investigation into the Letelier Moffitt murders and sent agents to Chile to gather additional evidence that Pinochet had authorized the crime  The former Chilean Secret Police Chief  Manuel Contreras  who  as previously mentioned  was convicted for his role in the crime in 1993 and later pointed the finger at his boss  claimed that all his orders came from Pinochet   There are rumors that a draft indictment of Pinochet was prepared  but they were not confirmed by the George W  Bush administration   5  Recent disclosure  A US State Department document made available by the National Security Archive on 10 April 2010 reveals that a démarche protesting Pinochet s Operation Condor assassination program was proposed and sent on 23 August 1976 to US diplomatic missions in Uruguay  Argentina  and Chile to be delivered to their host governments but later rescinded on 16 September 1976 by Henry Kissinger  following concerns raised by US ambassadors assigned there of both personal safety and a likely diplomatic contretemps  Five days later the assassination took place   6  See also  Letelier case  Chilean political scandals  Chile under Pinochet
