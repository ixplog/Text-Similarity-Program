Vertical Interval Timecode  VITC  pronounced  vitsee  or  vits   is a form of SMPTE timecode embedded as a pair of black and white bars in a video signal  These lines are typically inserted into the vertical blanking interval of the video signal  There can be more than one VITC pair in a single frame of video  this can be used to encode extra data that will not fit in a standard timecode frame   VITC contains the same payload as SMPTE linear timecode frame embedded in a new frame structure with extra synchronization bits and an error detection checksum  The VITC code is always repeated on two adjacent video lines  one in each field  This internal redundancy is exploited by VITC readers  in addition to the standard timecode  flywheel  algorithm   A video frame may contain more than one VITC code if necessary  recorded on different line pairs  This is often used in production  where different entities may want to encode different sets of time code metadata on the same tape   As a practical matter  VITC can be more  frame accurate  than Linear timecode  LTC   particularly at very slow tape speeds on analog formats  LTC readers can lose track of code at slow jog speeds whereas VITC can be read frame by frame if need be  At high speeds  FF REW   the VITC is often unreadable due to image distortions  so the LTC is often used instead  Some VCRs have an auto selection between the two formats to provide the highest accuracy   VITC is 90 bits long  32 bits of time code  32 bits of user data  18 synchronization bits  and 8 bits of checksum   Bit 14 is set to 1 if drop frame numbering is in use  frame numbers 0 and 1 are skipped during the first second of every minute  except multiples of 10 minutes  This converts 30 frame second time code to the 29 97 frame second NTSC standard   Bit 15  the color framing bit  is set to 1 if the time code is synchronized to a  color  video signal  The frame number modulo 2  for NTSC and SECAM  or modulo 4  for PAL  should be preserved across cuts in order to avoid phase jumps in the chrominance subcarrier   Bit 35  the  bi phase mark correction bit  is set the same as in linear timecode  providing odd parity over the 64 time code and user bits  Bits 55 and 75  the  binary group flag  bits  indicate the format of the user bits  Their weighted sum is a number from 0 to 3  0 indicates no  or unspecified  format  while 1 indicates 4 8 bit characters  Values of 2 and 3  i e  bit 75 set  are reserved   Bit 74 is unassigned  should always be transmitted as zero  and ignored on reception   The CRC in bits 82–89 is a simple bytewise XOR of the previous 82 bits  including the sync bits   which can be described as a CRC with generator polynomial x8+1  The exact nature of the color frame sequence depends on the video standard being used  In the case of the three main composite video standards  PAL video has an 8 field  4 frame  color frame sequence  and NTSC and SECAM both have 4 field  2 frame  color frame sequences   Preserving the color framing sequence of video across edits and between channels in video effects was an important issue in early analog composite videotape editing systems  as cuts between different color sequences would cause jumps in subcarrier phase  and mixing two signals of different field dominance would result in color artifacts on the part of the signal that was not in sync with the output color frame sequence   To help prevent these problems  SMPTE time code contains a color framing bit  which can be used to indicate that the video material the timecode refers to follows a standard convention regarding the synchronization of video time code and the color framing sequence  If the color framing bit was set in both types of material  the editing system could then always ensure that color framing was preserved by constraining edit decisions between input sources to keep the correct relationship between the timecode sequences  and hence the color framing sequences ion bit  is set the same as in linear timecode  providing odd parity over the 64 time code and user bits   Bits 55 and 75  the  binary group flag  bits  indicate the format of the user bits  Their weighted sum is a number from 0 to 3  0 indicates no  or unspecified  format  while 1 indicates 4 8 bit characters  Values of 2 and 3  i e  bit 75 set  are reserved   Bit 74 is unassigned  should always be transmitted as zero  and ignored on reception   The CRC in bits 82–89 is a simple bytewise XOR of the previous 82 bits  including the sync bits   which can be described as a CRC with generator polynomial x8+1   1  See also  Related technologies and standards  Linear timecode  Burnt in timecode  CTL timecode  MIDI timecode  AES EBU embedded timecode  Rewritable consumer timecode  2  References  3  External links
