The voting paradox  also known as Condorcet s paradox or the paradox of voting  is a situation noted by the Marquis de Condorcet in the late 18th century  in which collective preferences can be cyclic  i e   not transitive   even if the preferences of individual voters are not  This is paradoxical  because it means that majority wishes can be in conflict with each other  When this occurs  it is because the conflicting majorities are each made up of different groups of individuals   For example  suppose we have three candidates  A  B  and C  and that there are three voters with preferences as follows  candidates being listed in decreasing order of preference    If C is chosen as the winner  it can be argued that B should win instead  since two voters  1 and 2  prefer B to C and only one voter  3  prefers C to B  However  by the same argument A is preferred to B  and C is preferred to A  by a margin of two to one on each occasion  The requirement of majority rule then provides no clear winner   Also  if an election were held with the above three voters as the only participants  nobody would win under majority rule  as it would result in a three way tie with each candidate getting one vote   When a Condorcet method is used to determine an election  a voting paradox among the ballots can mean that the election has no Condorcet winner  The several variants of the Condorcet method differ on how they resolve such ambiguities when they arise to determine a winner  Note that there is no fair and deterministic resolution to this trivial example because each candidate is in an exactly symmetrical situation   1  See also  Arrow s impossibility theorem  Discursive dilemma  Gibbardâ€“Satterthwaite theorem  Independence of irrelevant alternatives  Instant runoff voting  Kenneth Arrow  Section 1 with an example of a distributional difficulty of intransitivity + majority rule  Nakamura number  Smith set
