The Object Management Group  OMG  is an international  open membership  not for profit computer industry standards consortium  OMG Task Forces develop enterprise integration standards for a wide range of technologies and industries  OMG s modeling standards enable visual design  execution and maintenance of software and other processes  Originally aimed at standardizing distributed object oriented systems  the company now focuses on modeling  programs  systems and business processes  and model based standards   1  Overview  OMG provides only specifications  and does not provide implementations  But before a specification can be accepted as a standard by OMG  the members of the winning submitter team must guarantee that they will bring a conforming product to market within a year  This is an attempt to prevent unimplemented  and unimplementable  standards   Other private companies or open source groups are encouraged to produce conforming products and OMG is attempting to develop mechanisms to enforce true interoperability   OMG hosts technical meetings for its members and interested nonmembers  The Technical meetings provide a neutral forum to discuss  develop and adopt standards that enable software interoperability for a wide range of industries including  Finance  Manufacturing  CORBA  Security and more  In June 2014  the TC meeting will be in Boston  MA  in September 2014 in Austin  Texas  in December 2014  in Long Beach  California  and in March 2015  they will go to Reston  Virginia   2  History  Founded in 1989 by eleven companies  including Hewlett Packard  IBM  Sun Microsystems  Apple Computer  American Airlines and Data General   OMG s initial focus was to create a heterogeneous distributed object standard  The founding executive team included Christopher Stone  Richard Soley  and John Slitz  As of November  2012  the leadership includes Chairman and CEO Richard Soley  President and COO and Vice President and Technical Director Andrew Watson   Since 2000  the OMG s International Headquarters have been located in Needham  Massachusetts  In November  2012  the headquarters was moved from 140 Kendrick St to 109 Highland Ave   The goal was a common portable and interoperable object model with methods and data that work using all types of development environments on all types of platforms   In 1997  the Unified Modeling Language  UML  was added to the list of OMG adopted technologies  UML is a standardized general purpose modeling language in the field of object oriented software engineering   In June 2005  the Business Process Management Initiative  BPMI org  and OMG announced the merger of their respective Business Process Management  BPM  activities to form the Business Modeling and Integration Domain Task Force  BMI DTF    In 2006 the Business Process Model and Notation  BPMN  was adopted as a standard by OMG   In 2007 the Business Motivation Model  BMM  was adopted as a standard by the OMG  The BMM is a metamodel that provides a vocabulary for corporate governance and strategic planning and is particularly relevant to businesses undertaking governance  regulatory compliance  business transformation and strategic planning activities   In 2009 OMG  together with the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon  launched the Consortium of IT Software Quality  CISQ   CISQ brings together industry executives from Global 2000 IT organizations  system integrators  outsourcers  and package vendors to jointly address the challenge of standardizing the measurement of IT software quality and to promote a market based ecosystem to support its deployment   In 2011 OMG formed the   Founding sponsors included CA  IBM  Kaavo  Rackspace and Software AG  The CSCC is an OMG end user advocacy group dedicated to accelerating cloud s successful adoption  and drilling down into the standards  security and interoperability issues surrounding the transition to the cloud  The Council is not a standards organization  but will complement existing cloud standards efforts and establish a core set of client driven requirements to ensure cloud users will have the same freedom of choice  flexibility  and openness they have with traditional IT environments  CSCC is open to all end user organizations   In September  2011  the OMG Board of Directors unanimously voted to adopt the Vector Signal and Image Processing Library  VSIPL  as the latest OMG specification  Work for adopting the specification was led by Mentor Graphics  Embedded Software Division  RunTime Computing Solutions  The Mitre Corporation as well as the High Performance Embedded Computing Software Initiative  HPEC SI   VSIPL is an application programming interface  API  defined by an open standard developed by embedded signal and image processing hardware and software vendors  academia  application developers  and government labs  VSIPL and VSIPL++ contain hundreds of functions used for common signal processing kernel and other computations  These functions include basic arithmetic  trigonometric  transcendental  signal processing  linear algebra  and image processing  The VSIPL family of libraries has been implemented by multiple vendors for a range of processor architectures  including x86  PowerPC  Cell  and NVIDIA GPUs  VSIPL and VSIPL++ are designed to achieve high performance  increase programmer productivity and maintain portability across a range of processor architectures  Additionally  VSIPL++ was designed from the start to include support for parallelism   Late 2012 early 2013  The Object Management Group Board of Directors has adopted the Automated Function Point  AFP  specification  The push for adoption was led by the Consortium for IT Software Quality  CISQ   AFP provides a standard for automating the popular Function Point measure according to the counting guidelines of the International Function Point User Group  IFPUG    On March 27  2014  OMG announced it would be managing the newly formed Industrial Internet Consortium  IIC   An open membership  not for profit  the IIC will take the lead in establishing interoperability across industrial environments for a more connected world   3  Hot Topics  On the company s website  there is a page featuring a few of the different technology areas that are currently trending  As of May 2  2014  the hot topics include  Data Distribution Service  Financial Industry Business Ontology  FIBO   Oil & Gas  Security Fabric  Software defined networking SDN   and Threat Modeling   4  OMG products  4 1  Common Object Request Broker Architecture  At its founding  OMG set out to create the initial Common Object Request Broker Architecture  CORBA  standard which appeared in 1991  CORBA is a standard that enables software components written in multiple computer languages and running on multiple computers to work together  i e   it supports multiple platforms   OMG has also developed a core set of standards adapting CORBA for embedded and real time systems  Implementations of real time CORBA are widely used in control systems in ships and aircraft   4 2  Data Distribution Service  Data Distribution Service for real time systems  DDS  is a specification of a publish subscribe middleware for distributed systems created in response to the need to augment CORBA with a data centric publish subscribe specification   4 3  Model Driven Architecture  OMG evolved towards modeling standards by creating the standard for Unified Modeling Language  UML  followed by related standards for  Meta Object Facility  MOF    XML Metadata Interchange  XMI   MOF Query Views Transformation  QVT    Model to text transformation language  MOFM2T   These together provide the foundation for Model Driven Architecture  MDA   and related set of standards  building upon the success of UML and MOF   Systems Modeling Language  SysML   a modeling language based on UML for use in Systems Engineering  has been standardized in collaboration with INCOSE   Significant progress has also been made in bringing the world of UML modeling and the Semantic Web together through the adoption of the Ontology Definition Metamodel which relates UML models in a standard way with RDF and Web Ontology Language  OWL  models   Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules  SBVR  is a landmark for the OMG  the first OMG specification to incorporate the formal use of natural language in modeling and the first to provide explicitly a model of formal logic  Based on a fusion of linguistics  logic  and computer science  and two years in preparation  SBVR provides a way to capture specifications in natural language and represent them in formal logic so they can be machine processed  SBVR is an integral part of MDA   4 4  Architecture Driven Modernization  Architecture Driven Modernization  ADM  is the reverse of MDA  ADMTF is an OMG group similar to ADTF with high potential   Knowledge Discovery Metamodel  KDM   a common intermediate representation for existing software systems and their operating environments  Knowledge Discovery Metamodel is designed as the OMG s foundation for software modernization and software assurance  Knowledge Discovery Metamodel uses Meta Object Facility to define an XMI interchange format between tools that work with existing software and an abstract interface for the next generation assurance and modernization tools   The Software Process Engineering Metamodel  SPEM  is an OMG standard for Meta Process Modeling   Abstract Syntax Tree Metamodel  ASTM   a modeling language for fine grained reverse engineering   Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules  SBVR  and KDM are designed as two parts of a unique OMG Technology Stack for software analytics related to existing software systems  KDM defines an ontology related to software artifacts and thus provides an initial formalization of the information related to a software system  SBVR is further used to formalize complex compliance rules related to the software   4 5  Domain models  Business models   OMG manages a number of standards for business modeling  including BPMN  the Business Motivation Model  BMM  and the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules  SBVR  specification   Verticals   Considerable progress has also been made in developing vertical model based standards in the healthcare  finance  telecommunications  manufacturing  software defined radio  space ground systems communications and some dozen other technology areas   4 6  Software assurance and regulatory compliance  New activities have been initiated to address important concerns of Regulatory Compliance and Software Assurance  building upon the base standards of MDA   4 7  Certification  OMG offers a number of professional certifications   OCEB   OMG Certified Expert in Business Process Management  BPM   OCUP   OMG Certified UML Professional
