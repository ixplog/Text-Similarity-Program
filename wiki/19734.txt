John Malcolm Fraser    born 21 May 1930  is a former Australian Liberal Party politician who was the 22nd Prime Minister of Australia  He came to power in 1975 through the dismissal of the Whitlam Labor government  in which he played a key role  After three election victories  he was defeated by Bob Hawke in the 1983 election and ended his career alienated from his own party   1  Early life and education  John Malcolm Fraser was born on 21 May 1930 in Toorak  Victoria to a family with a history of involvement in politics and the pastoral grazing industry  His grandfather  Simon Fraser  Sr   emigrated from Nova Scotia in 1853  becoming a successful pastoralist and speculator  as well as a member of the Victorian Parliament  the Federation Conventions of 1897–98 and the Australian Senate  An uncle  Simon Fraser  Jr   was a noted sportsman who rowed for Australasia at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm and also played Australian rules football for Essendon and University in the Victorian Football League   Malcolm Fraser s father  John Neville Fraser  had been educated at Trinity College  University of Melbourne   and was a pastoralist at Deniliquin in the Riverina region of New South Wales and later at a property called  Nareen station   in Nareen  near Hamilton in the Western District of Victoria  Malcolm Fraser s mother  Una Woolf  was of Jewish descent on her own father s side   Fraser grew up on the family s pastoral properties and was educated at Glamorgan  now part of Geelong Grammar School  and Melbourne Grammar School  before completing a degree in Philosophy  Politics and Economics  PPE   Modern Greats   at Magdalen College  Oxford  in 1952  At Oxford  Fraser was a classmate and friend of future Canadian cabinet minister and Prime Minister John Turner  Partly due to his education at Oxford  he began speaking in the RP like  cultivated  version of Australian English   2  Career  2 1  Early political career  Fraser contested the seat of Wannon  in Victoria s Western District  in 1954 for the Liberal Party  losing to Labor incumbent Don McLeod by 17 votes  However  a redistribution made Wannon notionally Liberal  and McLeod retired before the election held a year later  Fraser won the seat with a majority of more than 5 000 on a swing of 8 5 per cent  Aged 25  he was the youngest member of Parliament  He continued to represent Wannon until his retirement in 1983   2 2  Rise to leadership  Fraser had a long wait for ministerial preferment  He was finally appointed Minister for the Army by Harold Holt in 1966  in which he presided over the controversial Vietnam war conscription  Under John Gorton he became Minister for Education and Science  and in 1969 he was made Minister for Defence  a challenging post at the height of Australia s involvement in the Vietnam War and the protests against it   In March 1971  Fraser resigned abruptly in protest at what he said was Gorton s interference in his ministerial responsibilities  This led to the downfall of Gorton and his replacement by William McMahon  Gorton never forgave Fraser for the role he played in his ouster  and to the day he died in 2002 could not bear to be in the same room with him   Under McMahon  Fraser once again became Minister for Education and Science  When the Liberals were defeated at the 1972 election by the Labor Party under Gough Whitlam  he became Shadow Minister for Labour under Billy Snedden s leadership   2 3  Role in  the dismissal   After Snedden led the Coalition to defeat in the 1974 election  Fraser unsuccessfully challenged him for the opposition leadership in November  However  with Snedden still unable to get the better of Whitlam  Fraser again challenged Snedden for the leadership in March 1975  This time  he won   Later in 1975  in the context of a series of ministerial scandals that were rocking the Whitlam government  Fraser opted to use the Coalition opposition Senate numbers to delay the government s budget bills with the objective of achieving an early election  see 1975 Australian constitutional crisis   After several months of deadlock  during which the government secretly explored methods of obtaining supply funding outside the Parliament  Governor General Sir John Kerr intervened and revoked Whitlam s commission on 11 November 1975  Fraser was immediately sworn in as caretaker prime minister on condition that he secure Supply and advise an immediate election for both houses   On 19 November 1975 a letter bomb was sent to Fraser  but it was intercepted and defused before it reached him  Similar devices were sent to Governor General Kerr and Queensland premier Joh Bjelke Petersen   2 4  Prime minister  At the December 1975 election  the Liberal Country Party coalition won a landslide victory  The Coalition took 30 seats from Labor en route to a 55 seat majority  the largest in Australian history  The Coalition won a second term nearly as easily in 1977  The Liberals won a majority in their own right in both elections—something not even Holt or Robert Menzies had been able to achieve  Although there was no need for a coalition with the Country Party  the traditional non Labor coalition was retained   Fraser quickly dismantled some of the programs of the Labor government  such as the Ministry of the Media  and he made major changes to the universal health insurance system Medibank  He initially maintained Whitlam s real level of tax and spending  but real per person tax and spending soon began to increase  He did manage to rein in inflation which had soared under Whitlam  His so called  Razor Gang  implemented stringent budget cuts across many areas of the Commonwealth Public Sector  including the ABC   Although Fraser had long been identified with the Liberal Party s right wing  he did not carry out the radically conservative program that his political enemies had predicted  and that some of his followers wanted  Fraser s relatively moderate policies disappointed his Treasurer  John Howard  and other pro Thatcherite ministers  who were strong adherents of free market economics  Fraser s economic record was marred by rising unemployment  which reached record levels under his administration  caused in part by the ongoing effects of the 1973 oil crisis   Fraser was active in foreign policy  He supported the Commonwealth in campaigning to abolish apartheid in South Africa  and refused permission for the aircraft carrying the Springbok rugby team to refuel on Australian territory en route to their controversial 1981 tour of New Zealand  However  an earlier tour by the South African Ski Boat Angling Team was allowed to pass through Australia on the way to New Zealand in 1977  and the transit records were suppressed by Cabinet order   Fraser opposed white minority rule in Rhodesia  During the 1979 Commonwealth Conference  Fraser  together with his Nigerian counterpart  convinced newly elected British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to withhold recognition of the internal settlement Zimbabwe Rhodesia government  Thatcher had earlier promised to recognise it   Subsequently  the Lancaster House talks were held and Robert Mugabe was elected leader of an independent Zimbabwe at the inaugural 1980 election  A former deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has stated that Fraser was  the principal architect  in the installation of Robert Mugabe  Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere said he considered Fraser s role  crucial in many parts   and Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda called it  vital    Under his government  Australia recognised Indonesia s annexation of East Timor  although many East Timorese refugees were granted asylum in Australia  Fraser was a strong supporter of the United States and supported the boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow  But  although he persuaded some sporting bodies not to compete  Fraser did not try to the prevent the Australian Olympic Committee sending a team to the Moscow games   Fraser also surprised his critics in immigration policy  According to 1977 cabinet documents  the Fraser government adopted a formal policy for  a humanitarian commitment to admit refugees for resettlement   Fraser expanded immigration from Asian countries and allowed more refugees to enter Australia   Fraser supported multiculturalism and established a government funded multilingual radio and television network  the Special Broadcasting Service  SBS   though their first radio stations were established under the Whitlam government   Despite his support for SBS  the Fraser government imposed stringent budget cuts on the national broadcaster  the ABC  which came under repeated attack from the Coalition for its supposed left wing bias and for allegedly  unfair  or critical coverage on TV programs including This Day Tonight and Four Corners  and on the ABC s new youth oriented radio station Double Jay  2JJ   One result of the cuts was a plan to establish a national youth radio network  of which Double Jay was the first station  The network was delayed for many years  and did not come to fruition until the 1990s  Fraser also legislated to give Indigenous Australians control of their traditional lands in the Northern Territory  but would not impose land rights laws on the conservative governments in the states   2 4 1  Decline  At the 1980 election  Fraser saw his majority more than halved  from 48 seats to 21  The Coalition also lost control of the Senate  Fraser was convinced  however  that he had the measure of the Labor leader  Bill Hayden  But in 1982 the economy experienced a sharp recession  and also a protracted scandal over tax avoidance schemes run by prominent Liberals plagued the government  A popular minister  Andrew Peacock  resigned from Cabinet and challenged Fraser s leadership  Although Fraser won  these events left him politically weakened   By early 1982  it was obvious that popular former union leader Bob Hawke was to replace Hayden as Labor leader  Fraser was well aware of the infighting between Hayden and Hawke and planned to call a snap election for 1982  but those plans were derailed due to a severe back injury  On 3 February 1983  Fraser called a double dissolution election for 5 March  several months before it was due  Fraser was emboldened by a swing to the coalition in a by election for the Division of Flinders  He also believed he d finally caught Labor before Hawke took the leadership  However  Fraser made his run too late  Unknown to Fraser  Hayden had resigned in favour of Hawke that morning—literally hours before the writ was dropped  In the election  the Coalition was heavily defeated  suffering a 24 seat swing—the worst defeat of a non Labor government since Federation  It also made him  to date  the last Prime Minister from a non metropolitan seat   Fraser immediately resigned as Liberal leader  and retired from politics altogether two months later  Over the 13 years that the Liberals then spent in opposition until 1996  they tended to blame the  wasted opportunities  of the Fraser years for their problems  Fraser distanced himself from his old party  resigning from the party in 2009   3  Retirement  In retirement Fraser served as Chairman of the UN Panel of Eminent Persons on the Role of Transnational Corporations in South Africa 1985  as Co Chairman of the Commonwealth Group of Eminent Persons on South Africa in 1985–86  and as Chairman of the UN Secretary General s Expert Group on African Commodity Issues in 1989–90  He was a distinguished international fellow at the American Enterprise Institute from 1984 86  Fraser became president of the foreign aid group Care International in 1991  and worked with a number of other charitable organisations  In 2006  he was appointed Professorial Fellow at the Asia Pacific Centre for Military Law  and in October 2007 he presented his inaugural professorial lecture   Finding Security in Terrorism s Shadow  The importance of the rule of law    3 1  Memphis trousers affair  On 14 October 1986  Fraser  then the Chairman of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group  was found in the foyer of the Admiral Benbow Inn  a seedy Memphis hotel  wearing nothing but a towel and confused as to where his trousers were  The hotel was an establishment popular with prostitutes and drug dealers  Though it was rumoured at the time that the former Prime Minister had been with a prostitute  his wife stated that Fraser had no recollection of the events and that she believes it more likely that he was the victim of a practical joke by his fellow delegates   3 2  Estrangement from the Liberal Party  In 1993  Fraser made a bid for the Liberal Party presidency but withdrew at the last minute following opposition to his bid due to Fraser being critical of then Liberal leader John Hewson for losing the election earlier that year   After 1996  Fraser was critical of the Howard Coalition government over foreign policy issues  particularly John Howard s alignment with the foreign policy of the Bush administration  which Fraser saw as damaging Australian relationships in Asia   He opposed Howard s policy on asylum seekers  campaigned in support of an Australian Republic and attacked what he perceived as a lack of integrity in Australian politics  together with former Labor prime minister Gough Whitlam  finding much common ground with his predecessor and his successor Bob Hawke  who is also republican   The 2001 election completed Fraser s estrangement from the Liberal Party  Many Liberals criticised the Fraser years as  a decade of lost opportunity  on deregulation of the Australian economy and other issues  In early 2004  a Young Liberal convention in Hobart called for Fraser s life membership of the Liberal Party to be ended   In 2006  Fraser launched a  scathing attack  on the Howard Liberal government  attacking their policies on areas such as refugees  terrorism and civil liberties  and that  if Australia continues to follow United States policies  it runs the risk of being embroiled in the conflict in Iraq for decades  and a fear of Islam in the Australian community will take years to eradicate   Fraser claimed that the way the Howard government handled the David Hicks  Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon cases was questionable   On 20 July 2007  Fraser sent an open letter to members of the large activist group GetUp   encouraging members to support GetUp  s campaign for a change in policy on Iraq including a clearly defined exit strategy  Fraser stated   One of the things we should say to the Americans  quite simply  is that if the United States is not prepared to involve itself in high level diplomacy concerning Iraq and other Middle East questions  our forces will be withdrawn before Christmas    After the defeat of the Howard government at the 2007 federal election  Fraser claimed Howard approached him in a corridor  following a cabinet meeting in May 1977 regarding Vietnamese refugees  and said   We don t want too many of these people  We re doing this just for show  aren t we   The claims were made by Fraser in an interview to mark the release of the 1977 cabinet papers  Howard  through a spokesman  denied making the comment   In January 2008  Liberal MP Sophie Mirabella launched an attack on Fraser  after a speech he gave at Melbourne University on  the Bush Administration  reversing  60 years of progress in establishing a law based international system   claiming errors and  either intellectual sloppiness or deliberate dishonesty   and that he tacitly supports Islamic fundamentalism  should have no influence on foreign policy  and that his stance on the war on terror has left him open to caricature as a  frothing at the mouth leftie    In December 2009  shortly after the election of Tony Abbott to the Liberal Party leadership  Fraser resigned from the Liberal Party  Fraser said  the party was no longer a liberal party but a conservative party    3 3  Later political activity  In December 2011  Fraser was highly critical of the Australian government s decision  also supported by the Liberal Party Opposition  to permit the export of uranium to India  relaxing the Fraser government s policy of banning sales of uranium to countries that are not signatories of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty   In 2012  Fraser criticised the basing of U S  military forces in Australia  In 2014  speaking on the Russian RT television network  he criticised the concept of American exceptionalism and U S  foreign policy   In late 2012  Fraser wrote a foreword for The Journal Jurisprudence where he openly criticised the current state of human rights in Australia and the Western World   It is a sobering thought that in recent times  freedoms hard won through centuries of struggle  in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have been whittled away  In Australia alone we have laws that allow the secret detention of the innocent  We have had a vast expansion of the power of intelligence agencies  In many cases the onus of proof has been reversed and the justice that once prevailed as been gravely diminished    In July 2013  Fraser endorsed Australian Greens Senator Sarah Hanson Young in a television advertisement   4  Personal life  In 1956  Fraser married Tamara  Tamie  Beggs  with whom he has four children  Mark  1958   Angela  1959   Hugh  1963  and Phoebe  1966    5  Titles  styles and honours  5 1  Honours   Orders  1977 Companion of
