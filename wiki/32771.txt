Venom is the toxin used by venomous animals  Venom is injected into victims by means of a bite  sting or other sharp body feature   The potency of different venoms varies  lethal venoms are often characterised by the median lethal dose  LD50  LD50  or LD 50   expressed in terms of mass fraction  e g   milligrams of toxin per kilogram of body mass   that will kill 50% of victims of a specified type  e g   laboratory mice    Utilization of venom across a large amount species demonstrates a classic example of convergent evolution and a homoplastic trait  It is difficult to conclude exactly how this trait came to be so intensely widespread and diversified  The multigene families that encode the toxins of venomous animals are actively selected on  creating more diverse toxins with specific functions  Venoms adapt to their environment and victims and accordingly evolve to become maximally efficient on a predator’s particular prey  particularly the precise ion channels within the prey   Consequently  venoms become specialized to an animal’s standard diet   1  Diversity  1 1  Invertebrates  Venomous invertebrates include spiders  which use fangs   part of their chelicerae   to inject venom  see spider bite   and centipedes  which use forcipules   modified legs   to deliver venom  along with scorpions and stinging insects  which inject venom with a sting  In insects such as bees and wasps the stinger is a modified egg laying device – the ovipositor  In Polistes fuscatus the female continuously releases a venom that contains a sex pheromone that induces copulatory behavior in males  In Polistes exclamans venom is used as an alarm pheromone  coordinating a response with from the nest and attracting nearby wasps to attack the predator  In Dolichovespula arenaria  the observed spraying of venom out of their sting that has been seen from workers in large colonies  In other cases like Parischnogaster striatula  the venom is applied all over their body in order to make themselves immune to certain harmful diseases  Some cases like the venom from Agelaia pallipes  have significant inhibitory effects on essential biological processes like chemotaxis and hemolysis which can lead to organ failure  This prevents the spread of disease throughout the colony   Many caterpillars have defensive venom glands associated with specialized bristles on the body  known as urticating hairs  which can be lethal to humans  e g   that of the Lonomia moth   although the venom s strength varies depending on the species   Bees synthesize and employ an acidic venom  apitoxin  to cause pain in those that they sting to defend their hives and food stores  whereas wasps use a chemically different alkaline venom designed to paralyze prey  so it can be stored alive in the food chambers of their young  The use of venom is much more widespread than just these examples  Other insects  such as true bugs and many ants  also produce venom  At least one ant species  Polyrhachis dives  has been shown to use venom topically for the sterilisation of pathogens   There are many other venomous invertebrates  including jellyfish  cone snails and coleoids  The box jellyfish is the most venomous jellyfish in the world   1 2  Fish  Venom can also be found in some fish  such as the cartilaginous fishes – stingrays  sharks  and chimaeras – and the teleost fishes including onejaws  catfishes  stonefishes and waspfishes  scorpionfishes and lionfishes  gurnards  rabbitfishes  dragonets  surgeonfishes  scats  stargazers  weever  and swarmfish   1 3  Amphibians  There are only a few known species of venomous amphibians  certain salamandrid salamanders can extrude sharp venom tipped ribs   1 4  Snakes  The reptiles most known to use venom are snakes  some species of which inject venom into their prey via fangs   Snake venom is produced by glands below the eye  the mandibular gland  and delivered to the victim through tubular or channeled fangs  Snake venoms contain a variety of peptide toxins  including proteases  which hydrolyze protein peptide bonds  nucleases  which hydrolyze the phosphodiester bonds of DNA  and neurotoxins  which disable signalling in the nervous system  Snakes use their venom principally for hunting  though they do not hesitate to employ it defensively  Venomous snake bites may cause a variety of symptoms  including pain  swelling  tissue necrosis  low blood pressure  convulsions  hemorrhage  varying by species of snake   respiratory paralysis  kidney failure  coma and death   Scientists believe the origin of snake venom began with gene duplication of genes that had been expressed in the body tissues of ancestors  Due to subfunctionalization  in which an ancestral function is split between the copied genes  one of the duplicates becomes limited to only the venom  salivary  gland and as a result  evolves in to the toxin producing gene  Data has shown that pre existing proteins in the salivary glands were the origin of the toxins in snake venom  Some researchers have come to see snake venom as just “a modified form of saliva ” instead of an entirely recruited set of proteins from various tissues throughout the body   The composition of snake venom can vary within a species due to diet variation  which is caused by differences in geological location   1 5  Other reptiles  Aside from snakes  venom is found in a few other reptiles such as the Mexican beaded lizard and gila monster  and may be present in a few species of monitor lizards   One such reptile that was previously thought of as being nonvenomous is the Komodo dragon  Varanus komodoensis  It was then demonstrated through magnetic resonance imaging that the Komodo dragon possesses a mandibular gland with a major posterior compartment and five smaller anterior compartments  The scientists used mass spectrometry to show that the mixture of proteins present in the venom was as complex as the proteins found in snake venom   Due to these recent studies investigating venom glands in squamates  lizards that were previously thought of as being nonvenomous are now being classified by some scientists as venomous because they possess a venom gland  This hypothetical clade  Toxicofera  includes all venomous squamates  the suborders Serpentes and Iguania and the families Varanidae  Anguidae  and Helodermatidae   1 6  Mammals  Some mammals are also venomous  including solenodons  shrews  and the male platypus  Shrews are known to have venomous saliva and most likely evolved their trait similarly to snakes   Extensive research on platypuses shows that their toxin was initially formed from gene duplication  but data provides evidence that the further evolution of platypus venom does not rely as much on gene duplication as once was thought  Modified sweat glands are what evolved into platypus venom glands  Although it is proven that reptile and platypus venom have independently evolved  it is thought that there are certain protein structures that are favored to evolve into toxic molecules  This provides more evidence as to why venom has become a homoplastic trait and why very different animals have convergently evolved   1 7  Therapsida  Euchambersia  a genus of therocephalians  animals close to the evolution of mammals  is known to have had venom glands attached to its canine teeth  used to help subdue and kill its prey  The potency of its venom is unknown   2  Treatment of venomous bites  Physicians treat victims of a venomous bite with antivenom  which is created by dosing an animal such as a sheep  horse  goat  or rabbit with a small amount of the targeted venom  The immune system of the subject animal responds to the dose  producing antibodies to the venom s active molecules  the antibodies can then be harvested from the animal s blood and injected into bite victims to treat envenomation  This treatment can be used effectively only a limited number of times for a given individual  however  as a bite victim will ultimately develop antibodies to neutralize the foreign animal antigens injected into them as components of the antivenin  This is called sensitization  Even if a bite victim does not suffer a serious allergic reaction to the antivenom  his own  sensitized  immune system may destroy the antivenom before the antivenom can destroy the venom  Though most individuals never require even one treatment of anti venom in their lifetime  let alone several  those routinely exposed to snakes or other venomous animals may become sensitized to antivenom due to previous exposure   Aristolochia rugosa and Aristolochia trilobata  or  Dutchman s Pipe   are recorded in a list of plants used worldwide and in the West Indies  South and Central America against snakebites and scorpion stings  Aristolochic acid inhibits inflammation induced by immune complexes  and nonimmunological agents  carrageenan or croton oil   Aristolochic acid inhibits the activity of snake venom phospholipase  PLA2  by forming a 1 1 complex with the enzyme  Since phospholipase enzymes play a significant part in the cascade leading to the inflammatory and pain response  their inhibition could lead to relief of problems from scorpion envenomation   3  See also  Poison  Envenomation  Schmidt Sting Pain Index  Big Four  Indian snakes   List of venomous animals  4  References  5  Bibliography  Fry  B  G   N
