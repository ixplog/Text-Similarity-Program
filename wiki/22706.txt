An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble that contains sections of string  brass  woodwind  and percussion instruments  Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a keyboard section or may stand alone  as may the concert harp and electric and electronic instruments  The term orchestra derives from the Greek ὀρχήστρα  the name for the area in front of an ancient Greek stage reserved for the Greek chorus  The orchestra grew by accretion throughout the 18th and 19th centuries  but changed very little in composition during the course of the 20th century   A smaller sized orchestra for this time period  of about fifty musicians or fewer  is called a chamber orchestra  A full size orchestra  about 100 musicians  may sometimes be called a symphony orchestra or philharmonic orchestra  these modifiers do not necessarily indicate any strict difference in either the instrumental constitution or role of the orchestra  but can be useful to distinguish different ensembles based in the same city  for instance  the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra   A symphony orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster  in some cases over a hundred  but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the venue  A leading chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians  some are much smaller than that  Orchestras can also be found in schools  The term concert orchestra may sometimes be used  e g   BBC Concert Orchestra  RTÉ Concert Orchestra —no distinction is made on size of orchestra by use of this term  although their use is generally distinguished as for live concert  As such they are commonly chamber orchestras   1  Instrumentation  The typical symphony orchestra consists of 4 groups of similar musical instruments called the woodwinds  brass  percussion  and strings  Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a keyboard section or may stand alone  as may the concert harp and electric and electronic instruments  The orchestra  depending on the size  contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group  In the history of the orchestra  its instrumentation has been expanded over time  often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period and Ludwig van Beethoven s influence on the classical model   1 1  Beethoven s influence  The so called  standard complement  of double winds and brass in the orchestra from the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to the forces called for by Beethoven  The exceptions to this are his Symphony No  4  Violin Concerto  and Piano Concerto No  4  which each specify a single flute  The composer s instrumentation almost always included paired flutes  oboes  clarinets  bassoons  horns and trumpets  Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular timbral  palette  in Symphonies 3  5  6  and 9 for an innovative effect  The third horn in the  Eroica  Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility  but also the effect of  choral  brass in the Trio  Piccolo  contrabassoon  and trombones add to the triumphal finale of his Symphony No  5  A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver storm and sunshine in the Sixth  The Ninth asks for a second pair of horns  for reasons similar to the  Eroica   four horns has since become standard   Beethoven s use of piccolo  contrabassoon  trombones  and untuned percussion—plus chorus and vocal soloists—in his finale  are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony might be expanded for good  For several decades after his departure  symphonic instrumentation was faithful to Beethoven s well established model  with few exceptions   1 2  Expanded instrumentation  Apart from the core orchestral complement  various other instruments are called for occasionally  These include the classical guitar  heckelphone  flugelhorn  cornet  harpsichord  and organ  Saxophones  for example  appear in some 19th  through 21st century scores  While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works  for example Maurice Ravel s orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky s Pictures at an Exhibition and Sergei Rachmaninoff s Symphonic Dances  the saxophone is included in other works  such as Ravel s Boléro  Sergei Prokofiev s Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2  Vaughan Williams  Symphonies No 6 and 9 and William Walton s Belshazzar s Feast  and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble  The euphonium is featured in a few late Romantic and 20th century works  usually playing parts marked  tenor tuba   including Gustav Holst s The Planets  and Richard Strauss s Ein Heldenleben  The Wagner tuba  a modified member of the horn family  appears in Richard Wagner s cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen and several other works by Strauss  Béla Bartók  and others  it has a prominent role in Anton Bruckner s Symphony No  7 in E Major  Cornets appear in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky s ballet Swan Lake  Claude Debussy s La Mer  and several orchestral works by Hector Berlioz  Unless these instruments are played by members doubling on another instrument  for example  a trombone player changing to euphonium for a certain passage   orchestras will use freelance musicians to augment their regular rosters   The 20th century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors  In Beethoven s and Felix Mendelssohn s time  the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified  As time progressed  and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler  the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand picked by the composer  Today  however  the modern orchestra has generally been considered standardized with

Organization  Among the instrument groups and within each group of instruments  there is a generally accepted hierarchy  Every instrumental group  or section  has a principal who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos  The violins are divided into two groups  first violin and second violin  with the second violins playing with lower registers than the first violins   The principal first violin is called the concertmaster  or  leader  in the UK  and is not only considered the leader of the string section  but the second in command of the entire orchestra  behind only the conductor  The concertmaster leads the pre concert tuning and handles technical aspects of orchestra management  usually sitting to the conductor s left  closest to the audience  In some U S  and British orchestras  the concertmaster comes on stage after the rest of the orchestra is seated  takes a bow  and receives applause before the conductor  and the soloists  if there are any  appear on stage   The principal trombone is considered the leader of the low brass section  while the principal trumpet is generally considered the leader of the entire brass section  While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra  due to 300 year old convention   no principal is the leader of the woodwind section though in woodwind ensembles  often the flute is leader  Instead  each principal confers with the others as equals in the case of musical differences of opinion  The horn  while technically a brass instrument  often acts in the role of both woodwind and brass  Most sections also have an assistant principal  or co principal or associate principal   or in the case of the first violins  an assistant concertmaster  who often plays a tutti part in addition to replacing the principal in his or her absence   A section string player plays in unison with the rest of the section  except in the case of divided  divisi  parts  where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to  outside   nearer the audience  and  inside  seated players  Where a solo part is called for in a string section  the section leader invariably plays that part  Tutti wind and brass players generally play a unique but non solo part  Section percussionists play parts assigned to them by the principal percussionist   In modern times  the musicians are usually directed by a conductor  although early orchestras did not have one  giving this role instead to the concertmaster or the harpsichordist playing the continuo  Some modern orchestras also do without conductors  particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate  so called  period   performances of baroque and earlier music   The most frequently performed repertoire for a symphony orchestra is Western classical music or opera  However  orchestras are used sometimes in popular music  extensively in film music  and increasingly often in video game music  Orchestras are also used in the symphonic metal genre  The term  orchestra  can also be applied to a jazz ensemble  for example in performance of big band music   3  History of the orchestra  3 1  Early history  The first orchestras were made up of small groups of musicians that gathered for festivals  holidays  or funerals  It was not until the 11th century that families of instruments started to appear with differences in tones and octaves  True modern orchestras started in the late 16th century when composers started writing music for instrumental groups  In the 15th and 16th centuries in Italy the households of nobles had musicians to provide music for dancing and the court  however with the emergence of the theatre  particularly opera  in the early 17th century  music was increasingly written for groups of players in combination  which is the origin of orchestral playing  Opera originated in Italy  and Germany eagerly followed  Dresden  Munich and Hamburg successively built opera houses  At the end of the 17th century opera flourished in England under Henry Purcell  and in France under Lully  who with the collaboration of Molière also greatly raised the status of the entertainments known as ballets  interspersed with instrumental and vocal music   In the 17th century and early 18th century  instrumental groups were taken from all of the available talent  A composer such as Johann Sebastian Bach had control over almost all of the musical resources of a town  whereas Handel would hire the best musicians available  This placed a premium on being able to rewrite music for whichever singers or musicians were best suited for a performance — Handel produced different versions of the Messiah oratorio almost every year   As nobility began to build retreats away from towns  they began to hire musicians to form permanent ensembles  Composers such as the young Joseph Haydn would then have a fixed body of instrumentalists to work with  At the same time  traveling virtuoso performers such as the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart would write concerti that showed off their skills  and they would travel from town to town  arranging concerts along the way  The aristocratic orchestras worked together over long periods  making it possible for ensemble playing to improve with practice   3 2  Mannheim school  This change  from civic music making where the composer had some degree of time or control  to smaller court music making and one off performance  placed a premium on music that was easy to learn  often with little or no rehearsal  The results were changes in musical style and emphasis on new techniques  Mannheim had one of the most famous orchestras of that time  where notated dynamics and phrasing  previously quite rare  became standard  see Mannheim school   It also attended a change in musical style from the complex counterpoint of the baroque period  to an emphasis on clear melody  homophonic textures  short phrases  and frequent cadences  a style that would later be defined as classical   Throughout the late 18th century composers would continue to have to assemble musicians for a performance  often called an  Academy   which would  naturally  feature their own compositions  In 1781  however  the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra was organized from the merchants concert society  and it began a trend towards the formation of civic orchestras that would accelerate into the 19th century  In 1815  Boston s Handel and Haydn Society was founded  in 1842 the New York Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic were formed  and in 1858  the Hallé Orchestra was formed in Manchester  There had long been standing bodies of musicians around operas  but not for concert music  this situation changed in the early 19th century as part of the increasing emphasis in the composition of symphonies and other purely instrumental forms  This was encouraged by composer critics such as E  T  A  Hoffmann who declared that instrumental music was the  purest form  of music  The creation of standing orchestras also resulted in a professional framework where musicians could rehearse and perform the same works repeatedly  leading to the concept of a repertoire in instrumental music   3 3  Performance standards  In the 1830s  conductor François Antoine Habeneck  began rehearsing a selected group of musicians in order to perform the symphonies of Beethoven  which had not been heard in their entirety in Paris  He developed techniques of rehearsing the strings separately  notating specifics of performance  and other techniques of cuing entrances that were spread across Europe  His rival and friend Hector Berlioz would adopt many of these innovations in his touring of Europe   3 4  Instrumental craftsmanship  The invention of the piston and rotary valve by Heinrich Stölzel and Friedrich Blühmel  both Silesians  in 1815  was the first in a series of innovations  including the development of modern keywork for the flute by Theobald Boehm and the innovations of Adolphe Sax in the woodwinds  These advances would lead Hector Berlioz to write a landmark book on instrumentation  which was the first systematic treatise on the use of instrumental sound as an expressive element of music   The effect of the invention of valves for the brass was felt almost immediately  instrument makers throughout Europe strove together to foster the use of these newly refined instruments and continuing their perfection  and the orchestra was before long enriched by a new family of valved instruments  variously known as tubas  or euphoniums and bombardons  having a chromatic scale and a full sonorous tone of great beauty and immense volume  forming a magnificent bass  This also made possible a more uniform playing of notes or intonation  which would lead to a more and more  smooth  orchestral sound that would peak in the 1950s with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra and the conducting of Herbert von Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic   During this transition period  which gradually eased the performance of more demanding  natural  brass writing  many composers  notably Wagner and Berlioz  still notated brass parts for the older  natural  instruments  This practice made it possible for players still using natural horns  for instance  to perform from the same parts as those now playing valved instruments  However  over time  use of the valved instruments became standard  indeed universal  until the revival of older instruments in the contemporary movement towards authentic performance  sometimes known as  historically informed performance     At the time of the invention of the valved brass  the pit orchestra of most operetta composers seems to have been modest  An example is Sullivan s use of two flutes  one oboe  two clarinets  one bassoon  two horns  two cornets  a piston   two trombones  drums and strings   During this time of invention  winds and brass were expanded  and had an increasingly easy time playing in tune with each other  particularly the ability for composers to score for large masses of wind and brass that previously had been impractical  Works such as the Requiem of Hector Berlioz would have been impossible to perform just a few decades earlier  with its demanding writing for twenty woodwinds  as well as four gigantic brass ensembles each including around four trumpets  four trombones  and two tubas   3 5  Wagner s influence  The next major expansion of symphonic practice came from Richard Wagner s Bayreuth orchestra  founded to accompany his musical dramas  Wagner s works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity  indeed  his score to Das Rheingold calls for six harps  Thus  Wagner envisioned an ever more demanding role for the conductor of the theater orchestra  as he elaborated in his influential work On Conducting  This brought about a revolution in orchestral composition  and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years  Wagner s theories re examined the importance of tempo  dynamics  bowing of string instruments and the role of principals in the orchestra  Conductors who studied his methods would go on to be influential themselves   3 6  20th century orchestra  As the early 20th century dawned  symphony orchestras were larger  better funded  and better trained than ever before  consequently  composers could compose larger and more ambitious works  The influence of Gustav Mahler was particularly innovational  in his later symphonies  such as the mammoth Symphony No  8  Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries of orchestral size  employing huge forces  By the peak years of Shostakovich  orchestras could support the most enormous forms of symphonic expression  With the recording era beginning  the standard of performance reached a pinnacle  In recordings  small errors in a performance could be  fixed   but many older conductors and composers could remember a time when simply  getting through  the music as best as possible was the standard  Combined with the wider audience made possible by recording  this led to a renewed focus on particular conductors and on a high standard of orchestral execution  As sound was added to silent film  the virtuoso orchestra became a key component of the establishment of motion pictures as mass market entertainment   3 7  Counter revolution  In the 1920s and 1930s  economic as well as artistic considerations led to the formation of smaller concert societies  particularly those dedicated to the performance of music of the avant garde  including Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg  This tendency to start festival orchestras or dedicated groups would also be pursued in the creation of summer musical festivals  and orchestras for the performance of smaller works  Among the most influential of these was the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under the baton of Sir Neville Marriner   With the advent of the early music movement  smaller orchestras where players worked on execution of works in styles derived from the study of older treatises on playing became common  These include the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment  the London Classical Players under the direction of Sir Roger Norrington and the Academy of Ancient Music under Christopher Hogwood  among others   3 8  Recent trends in the United States  In the United States  the late 20th century saw a crisis of funding and support for orchestras  The size and cost of a symphony orchestra  compared to the size of the base of supporters  became an issue that struck at the core of the institution  Few orchestras could fill auditoriums  and the time honored season subscription system became increasingly anachronistic  as more and more listeners would buy tickets on an ad hoc basis for individual events  Orchestral endowments and—more centrally to the daily operation of American orchestras—orchestral donors have seen investment portfolios shrink or produce lower yields  reducing the ability of donors to contribute  further  there has been a trend toward donors finding other social causes more compelling  Also  while government funding is less central to American than European orchestras  cuts in such funding are still significant for American ensembles  Finally  the drastic falling off of revenues from recording  tied to no small extent to changes in the recording industry itself  began a period of change that has yet to reach its conclusion   U S  orchestras that have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy include the Philadelphia Orchestra  in April 2011   and the Louisville Orchestra  in December 2010  orchestras that have gone into Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have ceased operations include the Northwest Chamber Orchestra in 2006  the Honolulu Orchestra in March 2011  the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra in April 2011  and the Syracuse Symphony in June 2011  The Festival of Orchestras in Orlando  Florida ceased operations at the end of March  2011   Critics such as Norman Lebrecht were vocal in their diagnosis of the problem as the  jet set conductor   whose salaries were presumably bleeding the orchestras dry   and several high profile conductors have taken pay cuts in recent years  but the amounts of revenue involved are too small to account for the crisis  Music administrators such as Michael Tilson Thomas and Esa Pekka Salonen argued that new music  new means of presenting it  and a renewed relationship with the community could revitalize the symphony orchestra  The influential critic Greg Sandow has argued in detail that orchestras must revise their approach to music  performance  the concert experience  marketing  public relations  community involvement  and presentation to bring them in line with the expectations of 21st century audiences immersed in popular culture   It is not uncommon for contemporary composers to use unconventional instruments  including various synthesizers  to achieve desired effects  Many  however  find more conventional orchestral configuration to provide better possibilities for color and depth  Composers like John Adams often employ Romantic size orchestras  as in Adams  opera Nixon in China  Philip Glass and others may be more free  yet still identify size boundaries  Glass in particular has recently turned to conventional orchestras in works like the Concerto for Cello and Orchestra and the Violin Concerto No  2   Along with a decrease in funding  some U S  orchestras have reduced their overall personnel  as well as the number of players appearing in performances  The reduced numbers in performance are usually confined to the string section  since the numbers here have traditionally been flexible  as multiple players typically play from the same part    4  Conductorless orchestras  The post revolutionary symphony orchestra Persimfans was formed in the Soviet Union in 1922  The unusual aspect of the orchestra was that  believing that in the ideal Marxist state all people are equal  its members felt that there was no need to be led by the dictatorial baton of a conductor  instead they were led by a committee  Although it was a partial success  the principal difficulty with the concept was in changing tempo  The orchestra survived for ten years before Stalin s cultural politics effectively forced it into disbandment by draining away its funding   Some ensembles  such as the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra  based in New York City  have had more success  although decisions are likely to be deferred to some sense of leadership within the ensemble  for example  the principal wind and string players    Others have returned to the tradition of a principal player  usually a violinist  being the artistic director and running rehearsals  such as the Australian Chamber Orchestra  Amsterdam Sinfonietta & Candida Thompson and the New Century Chamber Orchestra    5  Multiple conductors  The techniques of polystylism and polytempo music have recently led a few composers to write music where multiple orchestras perform simultaneously  These trends have brought about the phenomenon of polyconductor music  wherein separate sub conductors conduct each group of musicians  Usually  one principal conductor conducts the sub conductors  thereby shaping the overall performance  Some pieces are enormously complex in this regard  such as Evgeni Kostitsyn s Third Symphony  which calls for nine conductors   Charles Ives often used two conductors  one for example to simulate a marching band coming through his piece  Realizations for Symphonic Band includes one example from Ives  Benjamin Britten s War Requiem is also an important example of the repertoire for more than one conductor   One of the best examples in the late century orchestral music is Karlheinz Stockhausen s Gruppen  for three orchestras placed around the audience  This way  the sound masses could be spacialized  as in an electroacoustic work  Gruppen was premiered in Cologne  in 1958  conducted by Stockhausen  Bruno Maderna and Pierre Boulez  Recently  it was performed by Simon Rattle  John Carewe and Daniel Harding   6  Other meanings of orchestra  In Ancient Greece  the orchestra was the space between the auditorium and the proscenium  or stage   in which were stationed the chorus and the instrumentalists  The word orchestra literally means  a dancing place    In some theaters  the orchestra is the area of seats directly in front of the stage  called primafila or platea   the term more properly applies to the place in a theatre  or concert hall reserved for the musicians   7  See also  Classical music  List of symphony orchestra concert halls  List of symphony orchestras  List of symphony orchestras in Europe  List
