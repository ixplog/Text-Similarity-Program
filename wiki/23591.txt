Panentheism  meaning  all in God   from the Ancient Greek pân   all    en   in   and Theós   God    is a belief system which posits that the divine interpenetrates every part of the universe and extends  timelessly  and  presumably  spacelessly  beyond it  Unlike pantheism  which holds that the divine and the universe are identical  panentheism maintains a distinction between the divine and non divine and the significance of both   In pantheism  the universe in the first formulation is practically the whole itself  while in panentheism  the universe and the divine are not ontologically equivalent  God is viewed as the eternal maintaining the universe  Some versions suggest that the universe is nothing more than the manifest part of God  In some forms of panentheism  the cosmos exists within God  who in turn  transcends    pervades  or is  in  the cosmos  While pantheism asserts that  All is God   panentheism goes further to claim that God is greater than the universe  In addition  some forms indicate that the universe is contained within God  like in the concept of Tzimtzum  Much Hindu thought is highly characterized by panentheism and pantheism  Hasidic Judaism merges the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical transcendent Divine Panentheism  through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of Kabbalah  with the populist emphasis on the panentheistic Divine immanence in everything and deeds of kindness   1  Ancient panentheism  1 1  In the Americas  Pre European   Many North American Native Peoples  such as the Cree  Iroquois  Huron  Navajo  and others  were and still are largely panentheistic  conceiving of God as both confined in God s existence in Creation but also transcendent from it   North American Native writers have also translated the word for God as the Great Mystery or as the Sacred Other  This concept is referred to by many as the Great Spirit  One exception can be modern Cherokee who are predominantly monotheistic but apparently not panentheistic  as the two are not mutually exclusive   yet in older Cherokee traditions many observe both aspects of pantheism and panentheism  and are often not beholden to exclusivity  encompassing other spiritual traditions without contradiction  a common trait among some tribes in the Americas  Most South American Native peoples were largely panentheistic as well  as were ancient South East Asian and African cultures   The Central American empires of the Mayas  Aztecs as well as the South American Incans  Tahuatinsuyu  were actually polytheistic and had very strong male deities   According to Charles C  Mann s   1491   only the lower classes of Aztec society were polytheistic  Writings from Aztec priests reveal them to be strong panentheists who considered the common mythology to be a symbolic oversimplification meant to be easier for the commoners to understand   1 2  In Europe  Neoplatonism is polytheistic and panentheistic  Plotinus taught that there was an ineffable transcendent  God   The One  of which subsequent realities were emanations  From the One emanates the Divine Mind  Nous  and the Cosmic Soul  Psyche   In Neoplatonism the world itself is God  Timaeus 37   This concept of divinity is associated with that of the Logos  which had originated centuries earlier with Heraclitus  ca  535–475 BC   The Logos pervades the cosmos  whereby all thoughts and all things originate  or as Heraclitus said   He who hears not me but the Logos will say  All is one   Neoplatonists such as Iamblichus attempted to reconcile this perspective by adding another hypostasis above the original monad of force or Dunamis  This new all pervasive monad encompassed all creation and its original uncreated emanations   2  Modern philosophy  Baruch Spinoza later claimed that  Whatsoever is  is in God  and without God nothing can be  or be conceived    Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God  or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner   Though Spinoza has been called the  prophet  and  prince  of pantheism  in a letter to Henry Oldenburg Spinoza states that   as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature  taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter   they are quite mistaken  For Spinoza  our universe  cosmos  is a mode under two attributes of Thought and Extension  God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world  According to German philosopher Karl Jaspers  when Spinoza wrote  Deus sive Natura   God or Nature  Spinoza did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms  but rather that God s transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes  and that two attributes known by humans  namely Thought and Extension  signified God s immanence  Furthermore  Martial Guéroult suggested the term  Panentheism   rather than  Pantheism  to describe Spinoza’s view of the relation between God and the world  The world is not God  but it is  in a strong sense   in  God  Yet  American philosopher and self described Panentheist Charles Hartshorne referred to Spinoza s philosophy as  Classical Pantheism  and distinguished Spinoza s philosophy with panentheism   The German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause  1781–1832  seeking to reconcile monotheism and pantheism  coined the term panentheism   all in God   in 1828  This conception of God influenced New England transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson  The term was popularized by Charles Hartshorne in his development of process theology and has also been adopted by proponents of various New Thought beliefs  The formalization of this term in the West in the 18th century was of course not new  philosophical treatises had been written on it in the context of Hinduism for millennia   Philosophers who embraced panentheism have included Thomas Hill Green  1839–1882   James Ward  1843–1925   Andrew Seth Pringle Pattison  1856–1931  and Samuel Alexander  1859–1938   Beginning in the 1940s  Hartshorne examined numerous conceptions of God  He reviewed and discarded pantheism  deism  and pandeism in favor of panentheism  finding that such a  doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations   Hartshorne formulated God as a being who could become  more perfect   He has absolute perfection in categories for which absolute perfection is possible  and relative perfection  i e   is superior to all others  in categories for which perfection cannot be precisely determined   3  In religion  3 1  Bahá í Faith  In the Bahá í Faith  God is described as a single  imperishable God  the creator of all things  including all the creatures and forces in the universe  The connection between God and the world is that of the creator to his creation  God is understood to be independent of his creation  and that creation is dependent and contingent on God  God  however  is not seen to be part of creation as he cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures  Instead  in the Bahá í understanding  the world of creation emanates from God  in that all things have been realized by him and have attained to existence  Creation is seen as the expression of God s will in the contingent world  and every created thing is seen as a sign of God s sovereignty  and leading to knowledge of him  the signs of God are most particularly revealed in human beings   3 2  Christianity  Panentheism is also a feature of some Christian philosophical theologies and resonates strongly within the Orthodox Tradition  It also appears in Roman Catholic mysticism and process theology   Process theological thinkers are generally regarded in the West as unorthodox  but process philosophical thought paved the way for open theism  which sits more comfortably in the Evangelical Christian camp   3 2 1  Eastern Christianity  In the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches  as well as in the Church of the East  creation is not considered to be a literal  part of  God  and the Godhead is distinct from creation  There is  in other words  an eternal difference between the uncreated  i e   God  and the created  i e   everything else   This does not mean  however  that the creation is wholly separated from God  because the creation exists by and in the Divine Energies  workings   These energies are the operations of God and are God  but the created is not God in the Divine Essence  God creates the universe by the Divine will  using His Energies  that are not identified with His Essence  It is not an  emanation  of God s own essence  Ousia   a direct literal outworking or effulgence of the Divine  or any other process which implies that creation is part of or necessary to God in His Essence  The use of panentheism as part of Orthodox theology and doctrine is  problematic  to those who would insist that panentheism requires creation to be  part of  God   God is not merely creator of the universe  His active Presence is necessary in some way for every bit of creation  from smallest to greatest  to continue to exist at all  That is  God s Energies  activities  maintain all things and all beings  even if those beings have explicitly rejected him  His love of creation is such that He will not withdraw His Presence  which would be the ultimate form of annihilation  not merely imposing death  but ending existence altogether  By this token  the entirety of creation is good in its being and is not innately evil either in whole or in part  This does not deny the existence of evil in a fallen universe  only that it is not an innate property of creation  Evil results from the will of creatures  not from their nature per se  see the problem of evil    3 2 2  Other Christian panentheists  Panentheistic conceptions of God occur amongst some modern theologians  Process theology and Creation Spirituality  two recent developments in Christian theology  contain panentheistic ideas   Some argue that panentheism should also include the notion that God has always been related to some world or another  which denies the idea of creation out of nothing  creatio ex nihilo   Nazarene Methodist theologian Thomas Jay Oord advocates panentheism  but he uses the word  theocosmocentrism  to highlight the notion that God and some world or another are the primary conceptual starting blocks for eminently fruitful theology  This form of panentheism helps in overcoming the problem of evil and in proposing that God s love for the world is essential to who God is   Panentheism was a major force in the Unitarian church for a long time  based on Ralph Waldo Emerson s concept of the Oversoul  This survives today as the panentheistic religion  Oversoul  Charles Hartshorne  who conjoined process theology with panentheism  maintained a lifelong membership in the Methodist church but was also a unitarian  In later years he joined the Austin  Texas  Unitarian Universalist congregation and was an active participant in that church   Many Christians who believe in universalism hold panentheistic views of God in conjunction with their belief in apocatastasis  also called universal reconciliation  Panentheistic Christian Universalists often believe that all creation s subsistence in God renders untenable the notion of final and permanent alienation from Him  they point to Biblical scripture passages such as Ephesians 4 6    God  is over all and through all and in all   and Romans 11 36   from  God  and through him and to him are all things   to justify both panentheism and universalism   3 3  Hinduism  Earliest reference to panentheistic thought in Hindu philosophy is in a creation myth contained in the later section of Rig Veda called the Purusha Sukta  which was compiled before 1100 BCE  The Purusha Sukta gives a description of the spiritual unity of the cosmos  It presents the nature of Purusha or the cosmic being as both immanent in the manifested world and yet transcendent to it  From this being the sukta holds  the original creative will proceeds  by which this vast universe is projected in space and time   The most influential and dominant school of Indian philosophy  Advaita Vedanta  rejects theism and dualism by insisting that “Brahman  ultimate reality  is without parts or attributes…one without a second ” Since  Brahman has no properties  contains no internal diversity and is identical with the whole reality it cannot be understood as God  The relationship between Brahman and the creation is often thought to be panentheistic   Panentheism is also expressed in the Bhagavad Gita  In verse IX 4  Krishna states   Many schools of Hindu thought espouse monistic theism  which is thought to be similar to a panentheistic viewpoint  Nimbarka s school of differential monism  Dvaitadvaita   Ramanuja s school of qualified monism  Vishistadvaita  and Saiva Siddhanta and Kashmir Shaivism are all considered to be panentheistic  Caitanya s Gaudiya Vaishnavism  which elucidates the doctrine of Acintya Bheda Abheda  inconceivable oneness and difference   is also thought to be panentheistic  In Kashmir Shaivism  all things are believed to be a manifestation of Universal Consciousness  Cit or Brahman   So from the point of view of this school  the phenomenal world  Śakti  is real  and it exists and has its being in Consciousness  Cit   Thus  Kashmir Shaivism is also propounding of theistic monism or panentheism   Shaktism  or Tantra  is regarded as an Indian prototype of Panentheism  Shakti is considered to be the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy and dynamism  and the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe  Shiva is her transcendent masculine aspect  providing the divine ground of all being   There is no Shiva without Shakti  or Shakti without Shiva  The two       in themselves are One   Thus  it is She who becomes the time and space  the cosmos  it is She who becomes the five elements  and thus all animate life and inanimate forms  She is the primordial energy that holds all creation and destruction  all cycles of birth and death  all laws of cause and effect within Herself  and yet is greater than the sum total of all these  She is transcendent  but becomes immanent as the cosmos  Mula Prakriti   She  the Primordial Energy  directly becomes Matter   3 4  Sikhism  The Sikh gurus have described God in numerous ways in their hymns included in the Guru Granth Sahib  the holy scripture of Sikhism  but the oneness of the deity is consistently emphasized throughout  God is described in the Mool Mantar  the first passage in the Guru Granth Sahib  and the basic formula of the faith is    GG  Pg 1  — ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥ Ik onkar satinam karta purakhu nirbhau nirvair akal murat ajuni saibhan gurprasad One Universal Creator God  The Name Is Truth

 436    Guru Nanak prefixed the numeral one  ik  to it  making it Ik Oankar or Ekankar to stress God s oneness  God is named and known only through his Own immanent nature  The only name which can be said to truly fit God s transcendent state is Sat  Sanskrit Satnam  Truth   the changeless and timeless Reality  God is transcendent and all pervasive at the same time  Transcendence and immanence are two aspects of the same single Supreme Reality  The Reality is immanent in the entire creation  but the creation as a whole fails to contain God fully  As says Guru Tegh Bahadur  Nanak IX   He has himself spread out His Her Own “maya”  worldly illusion  which He oversees  many different forms He assumes in many colours  yet He stays independent of all   GG  537    3 5  Islam  Several Sufi saints and thinkers  primarily Ibn Arabi  held beliefs that were somewhat panentheistic  These notions later took shape in the theory of wahdat ul wujud  the Unity of All Things   Some Sufi Orders  notably the Bektashis and the Universal Sufi movement  continue to espouse panentheistic beliefs  Nizari Ismaili follow panentheism according to Ismaili doctrine   3 6  Judaism  While mainstream Rabbinic Judaism is classically monotheistic  and follows in the footsteps of the Aristotelian theologian Maimonides  the panentheistic conception of God can be found among certain mystical Jewish traditions  A leading scholar of Kabbalah  Moshe Idel ascribes this doctrine to the kabbalistic system of Rabbi Moses Cordovero  1522–1570  and in the eighteenth century to the Baal Shem Tov  founder of the Hasidic movement  as well as his contemporary  Rabbi Menahem Mendel  the Maggid of Bar  There is some debate as to whether Lurianic Kabbalah  with its doctrine of Tzimtzum  can be regarded as panentheistic  According to Hasidism  The infinite Ein Sof is incorporeal  and exists in a state that is both transcendent and immanent  Aspects of panentheism are also evident in the theology of Reconstructionist Judaism as presented in the writings of Mordecai Kaplan   3 7  Gnosticism  Some branches of Gnosticism teach a panentheistic view of reality  and hold to the belief that God exists in the visible world only as sparks of spiritual  light   The goal of human existence is to know the sparks within oneself in order to return to God  who is in the Fullness  or Pleroma    Gnosticism is panentheistic  believing that the true God is simultaneously both separate from the physical universe and present within it  As Jesus states in the Gospel of Thomas   I am the light that is over all things  I am all    Split a piece of wood  I am there  Lift up the stone  and you will find me there   This seemingly contradictory interpretation of Gnostic theology is not without controversy  since one interpretation of dualistic theology holds that a perfect God of pure spirit would not manifest himself through the fallen world of matter  As Mani  the founder of Manichaeism  stated   The true God has nothing to do with the material world or cosmos   and   It is the Prince of Darkness who spoke with Moses  the Jews and their priests  Thus the Christians  the Jews  and the Pagans are involved in the same error when they worship this God  For he leads them astray in the lusts he taught them   Valentinian Gnosticism teaches that matter came about through emanations of the supreme being  and to some this event is held to be more accidental than intentional  To other Gnostics  these emanations are akin to the Sephirot of the Kabbalists  they are deliberate manifestations of a transcendent God through a complex system of intermediaries   3 8  Buddhism  The Reverend Zen Master Soyen Shaku was the first Zen Buddhist Abbot to tour the United States in 1905 6  He wrote a series of essays collected into the book Zen For Americans  In the essay titled  The God Conception of Buddhism  he attempts to explain how a Buddhist looks at the ultimate without an anthropomorphic God figure while still being able to relate to the term God in a Buddhist sense   At the outset  let me state that Buddhism is not atheistic as the term is ordinarily understood  It has certainly a God  the highest reality and truth  through which and in which this universe exists  However  the followers of Buddhism usually avoid the term God  for it savors so much of Christianity  whose spirit is not always exactly in accord with the Buddhist interpretation of religious experience  Again  Buddhism is not pantheistic in the sense that it identifies the universe with God  On the other hand  the Buddhist God is absolute and transcendent  this world  being merely its manifestation  is necessarily fragmental and imperfect  To define more exactly the Buddhist notion of the highest being  it may be convenient to borrow the term very happily coined by a modern German scholar   panentheism   according to which God is πᾶν καὶ ἕν  all and one  and more than the totality of existence  The essay then goes on to explain first utilizing the term  God  for the American audience to get an initial understanding of what he means by  panentheism   and then discusses the terms that Buddhism uses in place of  God  such as Dharmakaya  Buddha or AdiBuddha  and Tathagata   4  See also  Baruch de Spinoza  Brahman  Christian Universalism  Conceptions of God  The Cosmotheism beliefs of   Norman Lowell
