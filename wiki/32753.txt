The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 is an international treaty that defines a framework for diplomatic relations between independent countries  It specifies the privileges of a diplomatic mission that enable diplomats to perform their function without fear of coercion or harassment by the host country  This forms the legal basis for diplomatic immunity  Its articles are considered a cornerstone of modern international relations  As of April 2014  it has been ratified by 190 states   1  History  Throughout the history of sovereign states  diplomats have enjoyed a special status  Their function to negotiate agreements between states demands certain special privileges  An envoy from another nation is traditionally treated as a guest  their communications with their home nation treated as confidential  and their freedom from coercion and subjugation by the host nation treated as essential   The first attempt to codify diplomatic immunity into diplomatic law occurred with the Congress of Vienna in 1815  This was followed much later by the Convention regarding Diplomatic Officers  Havana  1928    The present treaty on the treatment of diplomats was the outcome of a draft by the International Law Commission  The treaty was adopted on 18 April 1961  by the United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities held in Vienna  Austria  and first implemented on 24 April 1964  The same Conference also adopted the Optional Protocol concerning Acquisition of Nationality  the Optional Protocol concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes
