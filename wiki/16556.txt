Jack Kirby  August 28  1917 – February 6  1994   born Jacob Kurtzberg  was an American comic book artist  writer and editor regarded by historians and fans as one of the major innovators and most influential creators in the comic book medium   Kirby grew up poor in New York City and learned to draw cartoon figures by tracing characters from comic strips and editorial cartoons  He entered the nascent comics industry in the 1930s and drew various comics features under different pen names  including Jack Curtiss  ultimately settling on Jack Kirby  In 1940  he and writer editor Joe Simon created the highly successful superhero character Captain America for Timely Comics  predecessor of Marvel Comics  During the 1940s  Kirby  generally teamed with Simon  created numerous characters for that company and for National Comics  the company that later became DC Comics   After serving in World War II  Kirby returned to comics and worked in a variety of genres  He produced work for a number of publishers  including DC  Harvey Comics  Hillman Periodicals and Crestwood Publications  where he and Simon created the genre of romance comics  He and Simon launched their own short lived comic company  Mainline Publications  Kirby ultimately found himself at Timely s 1950s iteration  Atlas Comics  soon to become Marvel  There  in the 1960s  he and writer editor Stan Lee co created many of Marvel s major characters  including the Fantastic Four  the X Men  and the Hulk  Despite the high sales and critical acclaim of the Lee Kirby titles  Kirby felt treated unfairly  and left the company in 1970 for rival DC   There Kirby created his Fourth World saga  which spanned several comics titles  While these series proved commercially unsuccessful and were canceled  the Fourth World s New Gods have continued as a significant part of the DC Universe  Kirby returned to Marvel briefly in the mid to late 1970s  then ventured into television animation and independent comics  In his later years  Kirby  who has been called  the William Blake of comics   began receiving great recognition in the mainstream press for his career accomplishments  and in 1987 he was one of the three inaugural inductees of the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame   Kirby was married to Rosalind  Roz  Goldstein in 1942  They had four children  and remained married until his death from heart failure in 1994  at the age of 76  The Jack Kirby Awards and Jack Kirby Hall of Fame were named in his honor   1  Life and career  1 1  Early life  1917–1935   Jack Kirby was born Jacob Kurtzberg on August 28  1917  on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City  where he was raised  His parents  Rose and Benjamin Kurtzberg  were Austrian Jewish immigrants  and his father earned a living as a garment factory worker  In his youth  Kirby desired to escape his neighborhood  He liked to draw  and sought out places he could learn more about art  Essentially self taught  Kirby cited among his influences the comic strip artists Milton Caniff  Hal Foster  and Alex Raymond  as well as such editorial cartoonists as C  H  Sykes   Ding  Darling  and Rollin Kirby  He was rejected by the Educational Alliance because he drew  too fast with charcoal   according to Kirby  He later found an outlet for his skills by drawing cartoons for the newspaper of the Boys Brotherhood Republic  a  miniature city  on East 3rd Street where street kids ran their own government   At age 14  Kirby enrolled at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn  leaving after a week   I wasn t the kind of student that Pratt was looking for  They wanted people who would work on something forever  I didn t want to work on any project forever  I intended to get things done    1 2  Entry into comics  1936–1940   Kirby joined the Lincoln Newspaper Syndicate in 1936  working there on newspaper comic strips and on single panel advice cartoons such as Your Health Comes First     under the pseudonym Jack Curtiss   He remained until late 1939  when he began working for the movie animation company Fleischer Studios as an inbetweener  an artist who fills in the action between major movement frames  on Popeye cartoons   I went from Lincoln to Fleischer   he recalled   From Fleischer I had to get out in a hurry because I couldn t take that kind of thing   describing it as  a factory in a sense  like my father s factory  They were manufacturing pictures    Around that time  the American comic book industry was booming  Kirby began writing and drawing for the comic book packager Eisner & Iger  one of a handful of firms creating comics on demand for publishers  Through that company  Kirby did what he remembers as his first comic book work  for Wild Boy Magazine  This included such strips as the science fiction adventure  The Diary of Dr  Hayward   under the pseudonym Curt Davis   the Western crimefighter feature  Wilton of the West   as Fred Sande   the swashbuckler adventure  The Count of Monte Cristo   again as Jack Curtiss   and the humor features  Abdul Jones   as Ted Grey  and   Socko the Seadog   as Teddy   all variously for Jumbo Comics and other Eisner Iger clients  He first used the surname Kirby as the pseudonymous Lance Kirby in two  Lone Rider  Western stories in Eastman Color s Famous Funnies #63 64  Oct  Nov  1939   He ultimately settled on the pen name Jack Kirby because it reminded him of actor James Cagney  However  he took offense to those who suggested he changed his name in order to hide his Jewish heritage   In the summer of 1940  Kirby and his family moved to Brooklyn  There  Kirby met Rosalind  Roz  Goldstein  who lived in the same apartment building  The pair began dating soon afterward  Kirby proposed to Goldstein on her eighteenth birthday  and the two became engaged   1 3  Partnership with Joe Simon  Kirby moved on to comic book publisher and newspaper syndicator Fox Feature Syndicate  earning a then reasonable $15 a week salary  He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle  published from January to March 1940  starring a character created by the pseudonymous Charles Nicholas  a house name that Kirby retained for the three month long strip  During this time  Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor Joe Simon  who in addition to his staff work continued to freelance  Simon recalled in 1988   I loved Jack s work and the first time I saw it I couldn t believe what I was seeing  He asked if we could do some freelance work together  I was delighted and I took him over to my little office  We worked from the second issue of Blue Bolt through    about 25 years    After leaving Fox and landing at pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman s Timely Comics  later to become Marvel Comics   Simon and Kirby created the patriotic superhero Captain America in late 1940  Simon cut a deal with Goodman that gave him and Kirby 25 percent of the profits from the feature  as well as salaried positions as the company s editor and art director  respectively  The first issue of Captain America Comics  released in early 1941  sold out in days  and the second issue s print run was set at over a million copies  The title s success established the team as a notable creative force in the industry  After the first issue was published  Simon asked Kirby to join the Timely staff as the company s art director   With the success of the Captain America character  Simon felt that Goodman was not paying the pair the promised percentage of profits  and so sought work for the two of them at National Comics  later renamed DC Comics   Kirby and Simon negotiated a deal that would pay them a combined $500 a week  as opposed to the $75 and $85 they respectively earned at Timely  Fearing that Goodman would not pay them if he found out they were moving to National  the pair kept the deal a secret with Stan Lee while they continued producing work for the company  Goodman eventually learned of the deal  and Kirby and Simon  convinced that Lee had revealed their plans  left after completing their work on Captain America Comics #10   Kirby and Simon spent their first weeks at National trying to devise new characters while the company sought how best to utilize the pair  After a few failed editor assigned ghosting assignments  National s Jack Liebowitz told them to  just do what you want   The pair then revamped the Sandman feature in Adventure Comics and created the superhero Manhunter  In July 1942 they began the Boy Commandos feature  The ongoing  kid gang  series of the same name  launched later that same year  was the creative team s first National feature to graduate into its own title  It sold over a million copies a month  becoming National s third best selling title  They scored a hit with the homefront kid gang team  the Newsboy Legion  featuring in Star Spangled Comics  In 2010  DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that  Like Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster  the creative team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby was a mark of quality and a proven track record    1 4  Marriage and World War II  1943–1945   Kirby married Roz Goldstein on May 23  1942   With World War II underway  Liebowitz expected that Simon and Kirby would be drafted  so he asked the artists to create an inventory of material to be published in their absence  The pair hired writers  inkers  letterers  and colorists in order to create a year s worth of material  Kirby was drafted into the U S  Army on June 7  1943  After basic training at Camp Stewart  near Savannah  Georgia  he was assigned to Company F of the 11th Infantry Regiment  He landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy on August 23  1944  two and a half months after D Day  though Kirby s reminiscences would place his arrival just 10 days after  Kirby recalled that a lieutenant  learning that comics artist Kirby was in his command  made him a scout who would advance into towns and draw reconnaissance maps and pictures  an extremely dangerous duty   Kirby and his wife corresponded regularly by v mail  with Roz sending  him a letter a day  while she worked in a lingerie shop and lived with her mother at 2820 Brighton 7th Street in Brooklyn  During the winter of 1944  Kirby suffered severe frostbite on his lower extremities and was taken to a hospital in London  England  for recovery  Doctors considered amputating Kirby s legs  but he eventually recovered from the frostbite  He returned to the United States in January 1945  assigned to Camp Butner in North Carolina  where he spent the last six months of his service as part of the motor pool  Kirby was honorably discharged as a Private First Class on July 20  1945  having received a Combat Infantryman Badge and a European African Middle Eastern Theater ribbon with a bronze battle star   1 5  Postwar career  1946–1955   Simon arranged for work for Kirby and himself at Harvey Comics  where  through the early 1950s  the duo created such titles as the kid gang adventure Boy Explorers Comics  the kid gang Western Boys  Ranch  the superhero comic Stuntman  and  in vogue with the fad for 3 D movies  Captain 3 D  Simon and Kirby additionally freelanced for Hillman Periodicals  the crime fiction comic Real Clue Crime  and for Crestwood Publications  Justice Traps The Guilty    The team found its greatest success in the postwar period by creating romance comics  Simon  inspired by Macfadden Publications  romantic confession magazine True Story  transplanted the idea to comic books and with Kirby created a first issue mock up of Young Romance  Showing it to Crestwood general manager Maurice Rosenfeld  Simon asked for 50% of the comic s profits  Crestwood publishers Teddy Epstein and Mike Bleier agreed  stipulating that the creators would take no money up front  Young Romance #1  cover date Oct  1947   became Jack and Joe s biggest hit in years   Indeed  the pioneering title sold a staggering 92% of its print run  inspiring Crestwood to increase the print run by the third issue to triple the initial number of copies  Initially published bimonthly  Young Romance quickly became a monthly title and produced the spin off Young Love—together the two titles sold two million copies per month  according to Simon—later joined by Young Brides and In Love  the latter  featuring full length romance stories   Young Romance spawned dozens of imitators from publishers such as Timely  Fawcett  Quality  and Fox Feature Syndicate  Despite the glut  the Simon & Kirby romance titles continued to sell millions of copies a month  which allowed Kirby to buy a house for his family in Mineola  Long Island  New York in 1949  which would be the family s home for the next 20 years  working out of a basement studio 10 feet in width  which the family referred to as  The Dungeon    Bitter that Timely Comics  1950s iteration  Atlas Comics  had relaunched Captain America in a new series in 1954  Kirby and Simon created Fighting American  Simon recalled   We thought we d show them how to do Captain America   While the comic book initially portrayed the protagonist as an anti Communist dramatic hero  Simon and Kirby turned the series into a superhero satire with the second issue  in the aftermath of the Army McCarthy hearings and the public backlash against the Red baiting U S  Senator Joseph McCarthy   1 6  After Simon  1956–1957   At the urging of a Crestwood salesman  Kirby and Simon launched their own comics company  Mainline Publications  securing a distribution deal with Leader News in late 1953 or early 1954  subletting space from their friend Al Harvey s Harvey Publications at 1860 Broadway  Mainline  which existed from 1954 to 1955  published four titles  the Western Bullseye  Western Scout  the war comic Foxhole  since EC Comics and Atlas Comics were having success with war comics  but promoting theirs as being written and drawn by actual veterans  In Love  since their earlier romance comic Young Love was still being widely imitated  and the crime comic Police Trap  which claimed to be based on genuine accounts by law enforcement officials  After the duo rearranged and republished artwork from an old Crestwood story in In Love  Crestwood refused to pay the team  who sought an audit of Crestwood s finances  Upon review  the pair s attorney s stated the company owed them $130 000 for work done over the past seven years  Crestwood paid them $10 000 in addition to their recent delayed payments  The partnership between Kirby and Simon had become strained  Simon left the industry for a career in advertising  while Kirby continued to freelance   He wanted to do other things and I stuck with comics   Kirby recalled in 1971   It was fine  There was no reason to continue the partnership and we parted friends    At this point in the mid 1950s  Kirby made a temporary return to the former Timely Comics  now known as Atlas Comics  the direct predecessor of Marvel Comics  Inker Frank Giacoia had approached editor in chief Stan Lee for work and suggested he could  get Kirby back here to pencil some stuff   While freelancing for National Comics  the future DC Comics  Kirby drew 20 stories for Atlas from 1956 to 1957  Beginning with the five page  Mine Field  in Battleground #14  Nov 1956   Kirby penciled and in some cases inked  with his wife  Roz  and wrote stories of the Western hero Black Rider  the Fu Manchu like Yellow Claw  and more  But in 1957  distribution troubles caused the  Atlas implosion  that resulted in several series being dropped and no new material being assigned for many months  It would be the following year before Kirby returned to the nascent Marvel   For DC around this time  Kirby co created with writers Dick and Dave Wood the non superpowered adventuring quartet the Challengers of the Unknown in Showcase #6  Feb  1957   while contributing to such anthologies as House of Mystery  During 30 months freelancing for DC  Kirby drew slightly more than 600 pages  which included 11 six page Green Arrow stories in World s Finest Comics and Adventure Comics that  in a rarity  Kirby inked himself  Kirby recast the archer as a science fiction hero  moving him away from his Batman formula roots  but in the process alienating Green Arrow co creator Mort Weisinger   He began drawing a newspaper comic strip  Sky Masters of the Space Force  written by the Wood brothers and initially inked by the unrelated Wally Wood  Kirby left National Comics due largely to a contractual dispute in which editor Jack Schiff  who had been involved in getting Kirby and the Wood brothers the Sky Masters contract  claimed he was due royalties from Kirby s share of the strip s profits  Schiff successfully sued Kirby  Some DC editors had criticized him over art details  such as not drawing  the shoelaces on a cavalryman s boots  and showing a Native American  mounting his horse from the wrong side    1 7  Marvel Comics in the Silver Age  1958–1970   Several months later  after his split with DC  Kirby began freelancing regularly for Atlas in spite of his lingering resentment of Lieber s earlier treatment of him in the 1940s  Because of the poor page rates  Kirby would spend 12 to 14 hours daily at his drawing table at home  producing eight to ten pages of artwork a day  His first published work at Atlas was the cover of and the seven page story  I Discovered the Secret of the Flying Saucers  in Strange Worlds #1  Dec  1958   Initially with Christopher Rule as his regular inker  and later Dick Ayers  Kirby drew across all genres  from romance comics to war comics to crime comics to Westerns  but made his mark primarily with a series of supernatural fantasy and science fiction stories featuring giant  drive in movie style monsters with names like Groot  the Thing from Planet X  Grottu  King of the Insects  and Fin Fang Foom for the company s many anthology series  such as Amazing Adventures  Strange Tales  Tales to Astonish  Tales of Suspense  and World of Fantasy  His bizarre designs of powerful  unearthly creatures proved a hit with readers  Additionally  he freelanced for Archie Comics  around this time  reuniting briefly with Joe Simon to help develop the series The Fly and The Double Life of Private Strong  Additionally  Kirby drew some issues of Classics Illustrated   It was at Marvel with writer and editor in chief Lee that Kirby hit his stride once again in superhero comics  beginning with The Fantastic Four #1  Nov  1961   The landmark series became a hit that revolutionized the industry with its comparative naturalism and  eventually  a cosmic purview informed by Kirby s seemingly boundless imaginationone well matched with the consciousness expanding youth culture of the 1960s   For almost a decade  Kirby provided Marvel s house style  co creating with Stan Lee many of the Marvel characters and designing their visual motifs  At Lee s request  he often provided new to Marvel artists  breakdown  layouts  over which they would pencil in order to become acquainted with the Marvel look  As artist Gil Kane described   Highlights other than the Fantastic Four include  the Hulk  Thor  Iron Man  the original X Men  Doctor Doom  Uatu the Watcher  Magneto  Ego the Living Planet  the Inhumans and their hidden city of Attilan  and the Black Panther comics  first known black superheroand his African nation of Wakanda  Kirby drew the first Spider Man story intended for publication in Amazing Fantasy #15 but Stan Lee chose to have Steve Ditko redraw the story  Lee and Kirby gathered several of their newly created characters together into the team title The Avengers and would revive characters from the 1940s such as the Sub Mariner  Captain America  and Ka Zar  The story frequently cited as Lee and Kirby s finest achievement is the three part  The Galactus Trilogy  that began in Fantastic Four #48  March 1966   chronicling the arrival of Galactus  a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet  and his herald  the Silver Surfer  Fantastic Four #48 was chosen as #24 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel s readers in 2001  Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that  As the fourth year of the Fantastic Four came to a close  Stan Lee and Jack Kirby seemed to be only warming up  In retrospect  it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the Marvel Age   Comics historian Les Daniels noted that   t he mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the 1960s   and Lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses   In 1968 and 1969  Joe Simon was involved in litigation with Marvel Comics over the ownership of Captain America  initiated by Marvel after Simon registered the copyright renewal for Captain America in his own name  According to Simon  Kirby agreed to support the company in the litigation and  as part of a deal Kirby made with publisher Martin Goodman  signed over to Marvel any rights he might have had to the character   Kirby continued to expand the medium s boundaries  devising photo collage covers and interiors  developing new drawing techniques such as the method for depicting energy fields now known as  Kirby Dots   and other experiments  Yet he grew increasingly dissatisfied with working at Marvel  There have been a number of reasons given for this dissatisfaction  including resentment over Stan Lee s increasing media prominence  a lack of full creative control  anger over breaches of perceived promises by publisher Martin Goodman  and frustration over Marvel s failure to credit him specifically for his story plotting and for his character creations and co creations  He began to both script and draw some secondary features for Marvel  such as  The Inhumans  in Amazing Adventures  as well as horror stories for the anthology title Chamber of Darkness  and received full credit for doing so  but in 1970  Kirby was presented with a contract that included such unfavorable terms as a prohibition against legal retaliation  When Kirby objected  the management refused to negotiate any contract changes  Kirby  although he was earning $35 000 a year freelancing for the company  subsequently left Marvel in 1970 for rival DC Comics  under editorial director Carmine Infantino   1 8  DC Comics and the Fourth World saga  1971–1975   Kirby spent nearly two years negotiating a deal to move to DC Comics  where in late 1970 he signed a three year contract with an option for two additional years  He produced a series of interlinked titles under the blanket sobriquet  The Fourth World   which included a trilogy of new titles — New Gods  Mister Miracle  and The Forever People — as well as the extant Superman s Pal Jimmy Olsen  Kirby picked the latter book because the series was without a stable creative team and he did not want to cost anyone a job  The central villain of the Fourth World series  Darkseid  and some of the Fourth World concepts  appeared in Jimmy Olsen before the launch of the other Fourth World books  giving the new titles greater exposure to potential buyers  The Superman figures and Jimmy Olsen faces drawn by Kirby were redrawn by Al Plastino  and later by Murphy Anderson  Les Daniels observed in 1995 that  Kirby s mix of slang and myth  science fiction and the Bible  made for a heady brew  but the scope of his vision has endured   In 2007  comics writer Grant Morrison commented that  Kirby s dramas were staged across Jungian vistas of raw symbol and storm   The Fourth World saga crackles with the voltage of Jack Kirby s boundless imagination let loose onto paper    An attempt at creating new formats for comics produced the one shot black and white magazines Spirit World and In the Days of the Mob in 1971   Kirby later produced other DC series such as OMAC  Kamandi  The Demon  and Kobra  and worked on such extant features as  The Losers  in Our Fighting Forces  Together with former partner Joe Simon for one last time  a new incarnation of the Sandman  Kirby produced three issues of the 1st Issue Special anthology series and created Atlas The Great  a new Manhunter  and the Dingbats of Danger Street   Kirby s production assistant of the time  Mark Evanier  recounted that DC s policies of the era were not in synch with Kirby s creative impulses  and that he was often forced to work on characters and projects on which he did not want to work   1 9  Return to Marvel  1976–1978   At the comic book convention Marvelcon  75  in spring 1975  Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Kirby was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for DC Comics  Lee wrote in his monthly column   Stan Lee s Soapbox   that   I mentioned that I had a special announcement to make  As I started telling about Jack s return  to a totally incredulous audience  everyone s head started to snap around as Kirby himself came waltzin  down the aisle to join us on the rostrum  You can imagine how it felt clownin  around with the co creator of most of Marvel s greatest strips once more    Back at Marvel  Kirby both wrote and drew the monthly Captain America series as well as the Captain America s Bicentennial Battles one shot in the oversized treasury format  He created the series The Eternals  which featured a race of inscrutable alien giants  the Celestials  whose behind the scenes intervention in primordial humanity would eventually become a core element of Marvel Universe continuity  He produced an adaptation and expansion of the film 2001  A Space Odyssey  as well as an abortive attempt to do the same for the classic television series  The Prisoner  He wrote and drew Black Panther and drew numerous covers across the line   Kirby s other Marvel creations in this period include Machine Man and Devil Dinosaur  Kirby s final collaboration with Stan Lee  The Silver Surfer  The Ultimate Cosmic Experience was published in 1978 as part of the Marvel Fireside Books series and is considered to be Marvel s first graphic novel   1 10  Film and animation  1979–1980   Still dissatisfied with Marvel s treatment of him  and with an offer of employment from Hanna Barbera  Kirby left Marvel to work in animation  In that field  he did designs for Turbo Teen  Thundarr the Barbarian and other animated series for television  He worked on The New Fantastic Four animated series  reuniting him with scriptwriter Stan Lee  He illustrated an adaptation of the Walt Disney movie The Black Hole for Walt Disney’s Treasury of Classic Tales syndicated comic strip in 1979 80   In 1979  Kirby drew concept art for film producer Barry Geller s script treatment adapting Roger Zelazny s science fiction novel  Lord of Light  for which Geller had purchased the rights  In collaboration  Geller commissioned Kirby to draw set designs that would be used as architectural renderings for a Colorado theme park to be called Science Fiction Land  Geller announced his plans at a November press conference attended by Kirby  former NFL American football star Rosey Grier  writer Ray Bradbury  and others  While the film did not come to fruition  Kirby s drawings were used for the CIA s  Canadian caper   in which some members of the U S  embassy in Tehran  Iran  who had avoided capture in the Iran hostage crisis  were able to escape the country posing as members of a movie location scouting crew   1 11  Final years and death  1981–1994   In the early 1980s  Pacific Comics  a new  non newsstand comic book publisher  made a then groundbreaking deal with Kirby to publish a creator owned series  Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers  and the six issue miniseries Silver Star  which was collected in hardcover format in 2007  This  together with similar actions by other independent comics publishers as Eclipse Comics  where Kirby co created Destroyer Duck in a benefit comic book series published to help Steve Gerber fight a legal case versus Marvel   helped establish a precedent to end the monopoly of the work for hire system  wherein comics creators  even freelancers  had owned no rights to characters they created   Though estranged from Marvel  Kirby continued to do periodic work for DC Comics during the 1980s  including a brief revival of his  Fourth World  saga in the 1984 and 1985 Super Powers miniseries and the 1985 graphic novel The Hunger Dogs  DC executives Jenette Kahn and Paul Levitz had Kirby re design the Fourth World characters for the Super Powers toyline as a way of entitling him to royalties for several of his DC creations  In 1987  under pressure from comics creators and the fan community  Marvel finally returned approximately 1 900 or 2 100 pages of the estimated 10 000 to 13 000 Kirby drew for the company   In 1985  Kirby helped to design the concept and designs for The Centurions  along with Gil Kane  A comic book series based on the show was published by DC and a toyline was produced by Kenner   Kirby retained ownership of characters used by Topps Comics beginning in 1993  for a set of series in what the company dubbed  The Kirbyverse   These titles were derived mainly from designs and concepts that Kirby had kept in his files  some intended initially for the by then defunct Pacific Comics  and then licensed to Topps for what would become the  Jack Kirby s Secret City Saga  mythos  Marvel posthumously published a  lost  Kirby Lee Fantastic Four story  Fantastic Four  The Lost Adventure  April 2008   with unused pages Kirby had originally drawn for a story that was partially published in Fantastic Four #108  March 1971    On February 6  1994  Kirby died at age 76 of heart failure in his Thousand Oaks  California home  He was buried at the Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park  Westlake Village  California   2  Kirby s estate  2 1  Subsequent releases  Lisa Kirby announced in early 2006 that she and co writer Steve Robertson  with artist Mike Thibodeaux  planned to publish via the Marvel Comics Icon imprint a six issue limited series  Jack Kirby’s Galactic Bounty Hunters  featuring characters and concepts created by her father for Captain Victory  The series  scripted by Lisa Kirby  Robertson  Thibodeaux  and Richard French  with pencil art by Jack Kirby and Thibodeaux  and inking by Scott Hanna and Karl Kesel primarily  ran an initial five issues  Sept  2006   Jan  2007  and then a later final issue  Sept  2007    In 2011  Dynamite Entertainment published Kirby  Genesis  an eight issue miniseries by writer Kurt Busiek and artists Jack Herbert and Alex Ross  featuring Kirby owned characters previously published by Pacific Comics and Topps Comics   2 2  Copyright dispute  On September 16  2009  the Kirby estate served notices of termination to Walt Disney Pictures  20th Century Fox  Universal Pictures  Paramount Pictures  and Sony Pictures to attempt to regain control of various Silver Age Marvel characters  Marvel sought to invalidate those claims  In mid March 2010 Kirby s estate  sued Marvel to terminate copyrights and gain profits from  Kirby s  comic creations   In July 2011  the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a summary judgment in favor of Marvel  which was affirmed in August 2013 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  The Kirby estate filed a petition on March 21  2014 for a review of the case by the Supreme Court of the United States  but a settlement was reached on September 26  2014 and the family requested that the petition be dismissed  While the settlement has left uncertainty in the jurisprudence relating to works governed by the Copyright Act of 1909 that were created before the Copyright Act of 1976 came into force  the Kirby estate s attorney  Marc Toberoff  said the issue of creators  rights to reclaim the work done as independent contractors remains  and other potential claims have yet to become ripe   3  Legacy  The New York Times  in a Sunday op ed piece written more than a decade after his death  said of Kirby   Michael Chabon  in his afterword to his Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay  a fictional account of two early comics pioneers  wrote   I want to acknowledge the deep debt I owe in this and everything else I ve ever written to the work of the late Jack Kirby  the King of Comics   Director James Cameron said Kirby inspired the look of his film Aliens  calling it  not intentional in the sense I sat down and looked at all my favorite comics and studied them for this film  but  yeah  Kirby s work was definitely in my subconscious programming  The guy was a visionary  Absolutely  And he could draw machines like nobody s business  He was sort of like A  E  van Vogt and some of these other science fiction writers who are able to create worlds that — even though we live in a science fictionary world today — are still so far beyond what we re experiencing   Several Kirby images are among those on the  Marvel Super Heroes  set of commemorative stamps issued by the U S  Postal Service on July 27  2007  Ten of the stamps are portraits of individual Marvel characters and the other 10 stamps depict individual Marvel Comic book covers  According to the credits printed on the back of the pane  Kirby s artwork is featured on  Captain America  The Thing  Silver Surfer  The Amazing Spider Man #1  The Incredible Hulk #1  Captain America #100  The X Men #1  and The Fantastic Four #3   In 2002  jazz percussionist Gregg Bendian released a seven track CD  Requiem for Jack Kirby  inspired by Kirby s art and storytelling  Titles of the instrumental cuts include  Kirby s Fourth World    New Gods    The Mother Box    Teaneck in the Marvel Age  and  Air Above Zenn La    Various comic book and cartoon creators have done homages to Kirby  Examples include the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mirage Comics series   Kirby and the Warp Crystal  in Donatello #1  and its animated counterpart   The King   from the 2003 cartoon series   The episode of Superman
