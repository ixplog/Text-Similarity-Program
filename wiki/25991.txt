success spawned many imitations  Garfield oversaw the successful growth of Magic and followed it with other exceptional game designs  Garfield also designed the CCGs Netrunner  BattleTech  Vampire  The Eternal Struggle  originally known as Jyhad   Star Wars Trading Card Game  the card game The Great Dalmuti  and the board game RoboRally  He also created a variation of the game Hearts called Complex hearts  Garfield first became passionate about games when he played the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons  so he designed Magic decks to be customizable like roleplaying characters  Garfield and Magic are in the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame   1  Early life and family  Garfield was born in Philadelphia  and spent his childhood in many locations throughout the world as a result of his father s work in architecture  His family eventually settled in Oregon when he was twelve  Garfield is the great great grandson of U S  President James A  Garfield  1831â€“81   and his great uncle invented the paper clip  He s also the nephew of Fay Jones  who  already an established artist  illustrated one Magic card for him   While always having an interest in puzzles and games  his passion for games began when he was introduced to Dungeons & Dragons   Garfield had designed his first game by the time he was 13   2  Education and career  In 1985  he received a Bachelor of Science degree in computer mathematics  He joined Bell Laboratories  then decided to continue his education and attended the University of Pennsylvania  and studied combinatorial mathematics   While searching for a publisher for RoboRally  which he designed in 1985  Wizards of the Coast began talking to Garfield through Mike Davis  but the game looked too expensive for a new company like Wizards to produce  Peter Adkison of Wizards of the Coast expressed interest in a fast playing game with minimal equipment  something that would be popular at a game convention  Adkison asked Garfield to develop a game that was cheaper to produce than RoboRally  that might be more portable and even easy to carry around to conventions  Garfield did have an idea about combining baseball cards with a card game and began turning that rough idea into a complete game over the next week  Garfield built on older prototypes of games that dated back to at least 1982  when he had created a Cosmic Encounter inspired card game called  Five Magics   Garfield thus combined ideas from two previous games to invent the first trading card game  Magic  The Gathering  At first  Garfield and Adkison called the game  Manaclash   and worked on the game during Palladium s lawsuit against Wizards  protecting the game s IP under a shell company called Garfield Games  Garfield began designing Magic as a Penn graduate student  A group of playtesters  comprising mostly fellow Penn students  formed around the developing game   Garfield studied under Herbert Wilf and earned a Ph D  in combinatorial mathematics from Penn in 1993  His thesis was The distribution of the binomial coefficients modulo p  He became a professor of mathematics at Whitman College in Walla Walla  Washington   Magic  The Gathering launched in 1993  Playtesters began independently developing expansion packs  which were then passed to Garfield to edit  Garfield left academia to join Wizards of the Coast as a full time game designer in June 1994  Garfield managed the hit game wisely  balancing player experience with business needs and allowing other designers to contribute creatively to the game  With his direction  Wizards established a robust tournament system for Magic  something that was new to hobby gaming   Wizards finally published Garfield s RoboRally in 1994  Wizards published Garfield s Vampire  The Masquerade based CCF Jyhad in 1994  but changed the name to Vampire  The Eternal Struggle in 1995 to avoid offending Muslims  Netrunner  1996  was Garfield s CCG based on Cyberpunk 2020  where he included an element that made it an entirely asymmetrical game  with the two players having different cards  abilities  and goals  Wizards published the BattleTech Collectible Card Game  1996   based on Garfield s design  Peter Adkison was developing a Dungeons & Dragons MMORPG based on a design from Garfield and Skaff Elias  but left Wizards in December 2000 after Hasbro sold the D&D computer rights and cancelled the project   In 1999  Garfield was inducted into the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame  as was Magic  He was a primary play tester for the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition bookset  released by Wizards in 2000  He eventually left Wizards to become an independent game designer   He still sporadically contributes to Magic  The Gathering  More recently  he has created the board games Pecking Order  2006  and Rocketville  2006   The latter was published by Avalon Hill  a subsidiary of Wizards of the Coast  He has shifted more of his attention to video games  having worked on the design and development of Schizoid and Spectromancer  He has been a game designer and consultant for companies including Electronic Arts and Microsoft   Garfield teaches a class titled  The Characteristics of Games  at the University of Washington   3  Games designed  A partial list of games designed by Garfield   Magic  The Gathering  1993   collectible card game  RoboRally  1994   board game  Vampire
