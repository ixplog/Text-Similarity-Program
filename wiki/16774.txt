Karl Dönitz    16 September 1891 – 24 December 1980   sometimes spelt Doenitz in English  was a German admiral who played a major role in the Naval history of World War II  He began his career in the Imperial German Navy  Kaiserliche Marine  before World War I  In 1918  while he was in command of   the submarine was sunk by British forces and Dönitz was taken prisoner  While in a prisoner of war camp  he formulated what he later called Rudeltaktik   pack tactic   commonly called  wolfpack    At the start of World War II  he was the senior submarine officer in the Kriegsmarine  In January 1943  Dönitz achieved the rank of Großadmiral  Grand Admiral  and replaced Grand Admiral Erich Raeder as Commander in Chief of the Navy  Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine    On 30 April 1945  after the death of Adolf Hitler and in accordance with Hitler s last will and testament  Dönitz was named Hitler s successor as Staatsoberhaupt  Head of State   with the title of Reichspräsident  President  and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces  On 7 May 1945  he ordered Generaloberst Alfred Jodl to sign the German instruments of surrender in Rheims  France  Großadmiral Dönitz remained as head of the Flensburg Government  as it became known  until it was dissolved by the Allied powers on 23 May  At the Nuremberg trials  he was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to ten years imprisonment  after his release  he lived quietly in a village near Hamburg until his death in 1980   1  Early life and career  Dönitz was born in Grünau in Berlin  Germany  to Anna Beyer and Emil Dönitz  an engineer  in 1891  Karl had an older brother  Friedrich  In 1910  Dönitz enlisted in the Kaiserliche Marine   Imperial Navy    He became a Seekadett  sea cadet  on 4 April  On 15 April 1911  he became a Fähnrich zur See  midshipman   the rank given to those who had served for one year as officer s apprentice and had passed their first examination   On 27 September 1913  Dönitz was commissioned as a Leutnant zur See  acting sub lieutenant   When World War I began  he served on the light cruiser in the Mediterranean Sea  In August 1914  the Breslau and the battlecruiser were sold to the Ottoman navy  the ships were renamed the Midilli and the Yavuz Sultan Selim  respectively  They began operating out of Constantinople  now Istanbul   under Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon  engaging Russian forces in the Black Sea  On 22 March 1916  Dönitz was promoted to Oberleutnant zur See  When the Midilli put into dock for repairs  he was temporarily assigned as airfield commander at the Dardanelles  From there  he requested a transfer to the submarine forces  which became effective in October 1916  He served as watch officer on   and from February 1918 onward as commander of   On 5 September 1918  he became commander of   operating in the Mediterranean  On 4 October  after suffering technical difficulties  this boat was sunk by British forces and Dönitz was taken prisoner on the island of Malta   2  Inter war period  The war ended in 1918  but Dönitz remained in a British camp near Sheffield as a prisoner of war until his release in July 1919  He returned to Germany in 1920   During the interwar period  he continued his naval career in the naval arm of the Weimar Republic s Armed Forces  On 10 January 1921  he became a Kapitänleutnant  lieutenant  in the new German navy  Vorläufige Reichsmarine   Dönitz commanded torpedo boats by 1928  becoming a Korvettenkapitän  lieutenant commander  on 1 November of that same year   On 1 September 1933  he became a Fregattenkapitän  commander  and  in 1934  was put in command of the cruiser Emden  the ship on which cadets and midshipmen took a year long world cruise in preparation for a future officer s commission   On 1 September 1935  he was promoted to Kapitän zur See  naval captain   He was placed in command of the 1st U boat flotilla Weddigen  which included   and    During 1935  the Weimar Republic s navy  the Reichsmarine  was replaced by the Nazi German navy  the Kriegsmarine   Throughout 1935 and 1936  Dönitz had misgivings regarding submarines due to German overestimation of the capabilities of British ASDIC intelligence  In reality  ASDIC could detect only one submarine in ten during exercises  In the words of Alan Hotham  British Director of Naval Intelligence  ASDIC was a  huge bluff    German doctrine at the time  based on the work of American Admiral Alfred Mahan and shared by all major navies  called for submarines to be integrated with surface fleets and employed against enemy warships  By November 1937  Dönitz became convinced that a major campaign against merchant shipping was practicable and began pressing for the conversion of the German fleet almost entirely to U boats  He advocated a strategy of attacking only merchant ships  targets relatively safe to attack  He pointed out that destroying Britain s fleet of oil tankers would starve the Royal Navy of supplies needed to run its ships  which would be just as effective as sinking them  He thought a German fleet of 300 of the newer Type VII U boats could knock Britain out of the war   Dönitz revived the World War I idea of grouping several submarines together into a  wolfpack  to overwhelm a merchant convoy s defensive escorts  Implementation of wolfpacks had been difficult in World War I owing to the limitations of available radios  In the interwar years  Germany had developed ultra high frequency transmitters which it was hoped would make their radio communication unjammable  while the Enigma cipher machine was believed to have made communications secure  Dönitz also adopted and claimed credit for Wilhelm Marschall s 1922 idea of attacking convoys using surface or very near the surface night attacks  This tactic had the added advantage of making a submarine undetectable by sonar   At the time  many – including Admiral Erich Raeder — felt such talk marked Dönitz as a weakling  Dönitz was alone among senior naval officers  including some former submariners  in believing in a new submarine war on trade  He and Raeder constantly argued over funding priorities within the Navy  while at the same time competing with Hitler s friends such as Hermann Göring  who received greater attention at this time   Since the surface strength of the Kriegsmarine was much less than that of the British Royal Navy  Raeder believed any war with Britain in the near future would doom it to uselessness  once remarking all the Germans could hope to do was to die valiantly  Raeder based his hopes on war s being delayed until the Kriegsmarine s extensive  Z Plan   which would have expanded Germany s surface fleet to where it could effectively contend with the Royal Navy  was implemented  The  Z Plan   however  was not scheduled to be completed until 1945   Dönitz  in contrast  was not constrained by such fatalism but set about intensely training his crews in the new tactics  The marked inferiority of the German surface fleet left submarine warfare as Germany s only naval option once war broke out   On 28 January 1939  Dönitz was promoted to commodore  Kommodore  and Commander of Submarines  Führer der Unterseeboote    3  World War II  In September 1939  Germany invaded Poland  Britain and France declared war on Germany  and World War II began  The Kriegsmarine was caught unprepared for war  having anticipated that war would break out in 1945  instead of 1939  The Z Plan was tailored for this assumption  calling for a balanced fleet with a greatly increased number of surface capital ships  including several aircraft carriers  At the time the war began  Dönitz s force included only 57 U boats  many of them short range  and only 22 oceangoing Type VIIs  He made do with what he had  while being harassed by Raeder and with Hitler calling on him to dedicate boats to military actions against the British fleet directly  These operations had mixed success  the aircraft carrier and battleship were sunk  battleships damaged and sunk at a cost of some U boats  diminishing the small quantity available even further  Together with surface raiders  merchant shipping lines were also attacked by U boats   3 1  Commander of the submarine fleet  On 1 October 1939  Dönitz became a Rear Admiral  Konteradmiral  and  Commander of the Submarines   Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote  BdU   on 1 September the following year  he was made a Vice Admiral  Vizeadmiral    With the fall of France  Germany acquired U Boat bases at Lorient  Brest  St Nazaire and La Pallice La Rochelle  A communication centre was established at the Chateau de Pignerolles at Saint Barthélemy d Anjou   By 1941  the delivery of new Type VIIs had improved to the point where operations were having a real effect on the British wartime economy  Although production of merchant ships shot up in response  improved torpedoes  better U boats and much better operational planning led to increasing numbers of  kills   On 11 December 1941  following Adolf Hitler s declaration of war on the United States  Dönitz immediately planned for implementation of Operation Drumbeat  Unternehmen Paukenschlag  This targeted shipping along the east coast of the United States  Carried out the next month with only nine U boats  all the larger Type IX   it had dramatic and far reaching results  The U S  Navy was entirely unprepared for antisubmarine warfare despite having had two years of British experience to draw from  and committed every imaginable mistake  Shipping losses  which had appeared to be coming under control as the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy gradually adapted to the new challenge  skyrocketed   On at least two occasions  Allied success against U boat operations led Dönitz to investigate  Among reasons considered were espionage and Allied interception and decoding of German naval communications  the naval version of the Enigma cipher machine   Both investigations into communications security came to the conclusion espionage was more likely  or else the Allied successes had been accidental  Nevertheless  Dönitz ordered his U boat fleet to use an improved version of the Enigma machine  one with four rotors  which was more secure than the three rotor version it replaced   the M4  for communications within the fleet  on 1 February 1942  The Kriegsmarine was the only branch to use this improved version  the rest of the Wehrmacht  German armed forces  continued to use their then current three rotor versions of the Enigma machine  The new system was termed  Triton    Shark  to the Allies   For a time  this change in encryption between submarines caused considerable difficulty for Allied codebreakers  it took ten months before Shark traffic could be read  see also Ultra codebreaking and Cryptanalysis of the Enigma    By the end of 1942  the production of Type VII U boats had increased to the point where Dönitz was finally able to conduct mass attacks by groups of submarines  a tactic he called  Rudel   group or pack  and became known as  wolfpack  in English  Allied shipping losses shot up tremendously  and there was serious concern for a while about the state of British fuel supplies   During 1943 the war in the Atlantic turned against the Germans  but Dönitz continued to push for increased U boat construction and entertained the notion that further technological developments would tip the war once more in Germany s favour  briefing the Führer to that effect  At the end of the war the German submarine fleet was by far the most advanced in the world  and late war examples such as the Type XXI U boat served as models for Soviet and American construction after the war  The Schnorchel  snorkel  and Type XXI boats appeared late in the war because of Dönitz s personal indifference  at times even hostility  to new technology he perceived as disruptive to the production process  His opposition to the larger Type IX was not unique  Admiral Thomas C  Hart  commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines at the outbreak of the Pacific War  opposed fleet boats like the Gato and Balao classes as  too luxurious    Dönitz was deeply involved in the daily operations of his boats  often contacting them up to seventy times a day with questions such as their position  fuel supply and other  minutiae   This incessant questioning hastened the compromise of his ciphers by giving the Allies more messages to work with  Furthermore  replies from the boats enabled the Allies to use direction finding  HF DF  called  Huff Duff   to locate a U boat using its radio  track it and attack it  often with aircraft able to sink it with impunity    Dönitz wore on his uniform the special grade of the U Boat War Badge with diamonds  his U Boat War badge from World War I and his World War I Iron Cross 1st Class with World War II clasp   3 2  Commander in chief and Grand Admiral  On 30 January 1943  Dönitz replaced Erich Raeder as Commander in Chief of the Navy  Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine  and Grand Admiral  Großadmiral  of the Naval High Command  Oberkommando der Marine   His deputy  Eberhard Godt  took over the operational command of the U boat force It was Dönitz who was able to convince Hitler not to scrap the remaining ships of the surface fleet  Despite hoping to continue to use them as a fleet in being  the Kriegsmarine continued to lose what few capital ships it had  In September  the battleship Tirpitz was put out of action for months by a British midget submarine  and was sunk a year later by RAF bombers at anchor in Norway  In December  he ordered the battleship Scharnhorst  under Konteradmiral Erich Bey  to attack Soviet bound convoys  after reconsidering her success in the early years of the war with sister ship Gneisenau  but she was sunk in the resulting encounter with superior British forces led by the battleship    3 3  President of Germany  In the final days of the war  after Hitler had taken refuge in the Führerbunker beneath the Reich Chancellery gardens in Berlin  Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring was considered the obvious successor to Hitler  followed by Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler  Göring  however  infuriated Hitler by radioing him in Berlin asking for permission to assume leadership of the Reich  Himmler also tried to seize power by entering into negotiations with Count Bernadotte  On 28 April 1945  the BBC reported Himmler had offered surrender to the western Allies and that the offer had been declined  From mid April 1945  elements of the last Reich government and the Commander of the Navy  Admiral Karl Dönitz  moved into the buildings of the Stadtheide Barracks in Plön  In his last will and testament  dated 29 April 1945  Hitler named Dönitz his successor as Staatsoberhaupt  Head of State   with the titles of Reichspräsident  President  and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces  The same document named Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels as Head of Government with the title of Reichskanzler  Chancellor   Furthermore  Hitler expelled both Göring and Himmler from the party   Rather than designate one person to succeed him as Führer  Hitler reverted to the old arrangement in the Weimar Constitution  He believed the leaders of the air force  Luftwaffe  and SS  Schutzstaffel  had betrayed him  Since the Kriegsmarine had been too small to affect the war in a major way  its commander  Dönitz  became the only possible successor as far as Hitler was concerned more or less by default   On 1 May  the day after Hitler s own suicide  Goebbels committed suicide  Dönitz thus became the sole representative of the crumbling German Reich  He appointed Finance Minister Count Ludwig Schwerin von Krosigk as  Leading Minister   Krosigk had declined to accept the title of Chancellor   and they attempted to form a government   3 4  Flensburg government  The rapidly advancing Allied forces limited the Dönitz government s jurisdiction to an area around Flensburg near the Danish border  Dönitz s headquarters were located in the Naval Academy in Mürwik  a suburb of Flensburg  Accordingly his administration was referred to as the Flensburg government  The following is Dönitz s description of his new government   Late on 1 May  Himmler attempted to make a place for himself in the Flensburg government  The following is Dönitz s description of his showdown with Himmler   On 4 May  German forces in the Netherlands  Denmark and northwestern Germany under Dönitz s command surrendered to Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery at Lüneburg Heath just southeast of Hamburg  signalling the end of World War II in northwestern Europe   A day later  Dönitz sent Admiral Hans Georg von Friedeburg  his successor as the commander in chief of the Kriegsmarine  to U S  General Dwight D  Eisenhower s headquarters in Rheims  France  to negotiate a surrender to the Allies  The Chief of Staff of OKW  Generaloberst  Colonel General  Alfred Jodl  arrived a day later  Dönitz had instructed them to draw out the negotiations for as long as possible so that German troops and refugees could surrender to the Western powers  But when Eisenhower let it be known he would not tolerate their stalling  Dönitz authorised Jodl to sign the instrument of unconditional surrender at 1 30 am on the morning of 7 May  Just over an hour later  Jodl signed the documents  The surrender documents included the phrase   All forces under German control to cease active operations at 23 01 hours Central European Time on 8 May 1945   At Stalin s insistence  on 8 May  shortly before midnight  Field Marshal General  Generalfeldmarschall  Wilhelm Keitel repeated the signing in Berlin at Marshal Georgiy Zhukov s headquarters  with General Carl Spaatz of the USAAF present as Eisenhower s representative  At the time specified  World War II in Europe ended   On 23 May  the Dönitz government was dissolved when Großadmiral Dönitz  Generaloberst Jodl  Reichsminister Speer and other members surrendered to British troops of the King s Shropshire Light Infantry at Flensburg  His ceremonial baton  awarded to him by Hitler  is found in the regimental museum of the KSLI in Shrewsbury Castle   4  Dönitz s relationship to Jews and Nazism  Despite his postwar claims  Dönitz was seen as supportive of Nazism during the war  Several naval officers described him as  closely tied to Hitler and Nazi ideology   On one occasion  he spoke of Hitler s humanity  Another event  in which he spoke to Hitler Youth in what was defined as an  inappropriate way   earned him the nickname of  Hitler Youth Dönitz   He refused to help Albert Speer stop the scorched earth policy dictated by Hitler  and is also noted to have declared   In comparison to Hitler we are all pipsqueaks  Anyone who believes he can do better than the Führer is stupid    Several antisemitic statements by Dönitz are known  When Sweden closed its international waters to Germany  he blamed this action on their fear and dependence on  international Jewish capital   In August 1944 he declared   I would rather eat dirt than see my grandchildren grow up in the filthy  poisonous atmosphere of Jewry    On German Heroes Day  12 March  of 1944  Dönitz declared that without Adolf Hitler Germany would be beset by  the poison of Jewry   and the country destroyed for lack of National Socialism  which  as Dönitz declared  met an uncompromising ideology with defiance  At the Nuremberg trials  Dönitz claimed the statement about the  poison of Jewry  was regarding  the endurance  the power to endure  of the people  as it was composed  could be better preserved than if there were Jewish elements in the nation   Initially he claimed   I could imagine that it would be very difficult for the population in the towns to hold out under the strain of heavy bombing attacks if such an influence were allowed to work    Author Eric Zillmer argues  that from an ideological standpoint  Dönitz was anti Marxist and antisemitic  Later  during the Nuremberg trials  Dönitz claimed to know nothing about the extermination of Jews and declared that nobody among   his  men  thought about violence against Jews   Dönitz told Leon Goldensohn  an American psychiatrist at Nuremberg   I never had any idea of the goings on as far as Jews were concerned  Hitler said each man should take care of his business  and mine was U boats and the Navy   Dönitz also told Dr  Goldensohn of his support for Admiral Bernhard Rogge  who was of Jewish descent  when the Nazi Party began to persecute him   5  Nuremberg war crimes trials  Following the war  Dönitz was held as a prisoner of war by the Allies  He was indicted as a major war criminal at the Nuremberg Trials on three counts   1  conspiracy to commit crimes against peace  war crimes  and crimes against humanity   2  planning  initiating and waging wars of aggression  and  3  crimes against the laws of war  Dönitz was found not guilty on count  1  of the indictment  but guilty on counts  2  and  3    Dönitz was  for nearly seven decades  the only head of state to be convicted by an international tribunal until the conviction of Liberia s Charles Taylor in April 2012   During the trial  Gustave Gilbert  an American Army psychologist  was allowed to examine the Nazi leaders who were tried at Nuremberg for war crimes  Among other tests  a German version of the Wechsler Bellevue IQ test was administered  Dönitz scored 138  the third highest among the Nazi leaders tested   Dönitz disputed the propriety of his trial at Nuremberg  commenting on count  2   One of the  accusations  that made me guilty during this trial was that I met and planned the course of the war with Hitler  now I ask them in heaven’s name  how could an admiral do otherwise with his country s head of state in a time of war   Over 100 senior Allied officers also sent letters to Dönitz conveying their disappointment over the fairness and verdict of his trial   At the trial Dönitz was charged with   Waging unrestricted submarine warfare against neutral shipping  see below    Permitting Hitler s Commando Order of 18 October 1942 to remain in full force when he became commander in chief of the Navy  and to that extent responsibility for that crime  His defence was that the Order excluded men captured in naval warfare  and that the order had not been acted upon by any men under his command   Knowing that 12 000 involuntary foreign workers were working in the shipyards  and doing nothing to stop it   Advice in 1945 when Hitler asked Dönitz whether the Geneva Convention should be denounced  Hitler s motives were twofold  The first was  reprisals could be taken against Western Allied prisoners of war  second  it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies  as was happening on the Eastern Front where the Geneva Convention was in abeyance   Instead of arguing the conventions should never be denounced  Dönitz suggested it was not currently expedient to do so  so the court found against him on this issue  but as the Convention was not denounced by Germany  and British prisoners in camps under Dönitz s jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention  the Court considered these mitigating circumstances   Among the war crimes charges  Dönitz was accused of waging unrestricted submarine warfare for issuing War Order No  154 in 1939  and another similar order after the Laconia incident in 1942  not to rescue survivors from ships attacked by submarine  By issuing these two orders  he was found guilty of causing Germany to be in breach of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936  However  as evidence of similar conduct by the Allies was presented at his trial  and with the help of his lawyer Otto Kranzbühler  his sentence was not assessed on the grounds of this breach of international law   On the specific war crimes charge of ordering unrestricted submarine warfare  Dönitz was found   not  guilty for his conduct of submarine warfare against British armed merchant ships   because they were often armed and equipped with radios which they used to notify the Admiralty of attack but the judges found   Dönitz is charged with waging unrestricted submarine warfare contrary to the Naval Protocol of 1936 to which Germany acceded  and which reaffirmed the rules of submarine warfare laid down in the London Naval Agreement of 1930    The order of Dönitz to sink neutral ships without warning when found within these zones was  therefore  in the opinion of the Tribunal  violation of the Protocol    The orders  then  prove Dönitz is guilty of a violation of the Protocol    the sentence of Dönitz is not assessed on the ground of his breaches of the international law of submarine warfare    His sentence on unrestricted submarine warfare was not assessed  because of similar actions by the Allies  in particular  the British Admiralty on 8 May 1940 had ordered all vessels in the Skagerrak sunk on sight  and Admiral Chester Nimitz  wartime commander in chief of the U S  Pacific Fleet  stated the U S  Navy had waged unrestricted submarine warfare in the Pacific from the day the U S  entered the war  Thus although Dönitz was found guilty of waging unrestricted submarine warfare against unarmed neutral shipping by ordering all ships in designated areas in international waters to be sunk without warning  no additional prison time was added to his sentence for this crime   Dönitz was imprisoned for 10 years in Spandau Prison in what was then West Berlin   6  Later years  Dönitz was released on 1 October 1956  and retired to the small village of Aumühle in Schleswig Holstein in northern West Germany  There he worked on two books  His memoirs  Zehn Jahre  Zwanzig Tage  Memoirs  Ten Years and Twenty Days   appeared in Germany in 1958 and became available in an English translation the following year  This book recounted Dönitz s experiences as U boat commander  10 years  and President of Germany  20 days   In it  Dönitz explains the Nazi regime as a product of its time  but argues he was not a politician and thus not morally responsible for much of the regime s crimes  He likewise criticizes dictatorship as a fundamentally flawed form of government and blames it for much of the Nazi era s failings   In 1973 he appeared in the Thames Television production The World at War  in one of his few TV appearances   Dönitz s second book  Mein wechselvolles Leben  My Ever Changing Life  is less known  perhaps because it deals with the events of his life before 1934  This book was first published in 1968  and a new edition was released in 1998 with the revised title Mein soldatisches Leben  My Life as a Soldier    Late in his life  Dönitz made every attempt to answer correspondence and autograph postcards for others  Dönitz was unrepentant regarding his role in World War II since he firmly believed that no one would respect anyone who compromised with his belief or duty towards his nation in any way  whether his betrayal was small or big  Of this conviction  Dönitz writes  commenting on Himmler s peace negotiations    The betrayer of military secrets is a pariah  despised by every man and every nation  Even the enemy whom he serves has no respect for him  but merely uses him  Any nation which is not uncompromisingly unanimous in its condemnation of this type of treachery is undermining the very foundations of its own state  whatever its form of government may be  Dönitz lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity in Aumühle  occasionally corresponding with collectors of German Naval history  and died there of a heart attack on 24 December 1980  As the last German officer with the rank of Grand Admiral  he was honoured by many former servicemen and foreign naval officers who came to pay their respects at his funeral on 6 January 1981  However  he had received only the pension pay of a captain because the West German government ruled all of his advances in rank after that had been because of Hitler  He was buried in Waldfriedhof Cemetery in Aumühle without military honours  and soldiers were not allowed to wear uniforms to the funeral  However a number of German naval officers disobeyed this order and were joined by members of the Royal Navy  such as the senior chaplain the Rev Dr John Cameron  in full dress uniform  Also in attendance were over one hundred holders of the Knight s Cross of the Iron Cross   6 1  Wife and children  On 27 May 1916 Dönitz married a nurse named Ingeborg Weber  1894–1962   the daughter of a German general Erich Paul Weber  1860–1933   They had three children whom they raised as Protestant  Evangelical  Christians  viz   daughter Ursula  1917   1990  and sons Klaus  1920   1944  and Peter  1922   1943    In 1937 Karl Dönitz s daughter Ursula married the U boat commander and Knight s Cross of the Iron Cross recipient Günther Hessler   Both of Dönitz s sons were killed during the Second World War  The younger  Peter  was a watch officer in and was killed on 19 May 1943  when his boat was sunk in the North Atlantic with all hands  After this loss  the older  Klaus  was allowed to leave combat duty and began studying to be a naval doctor  Klaus was killed on 13 May 1944 while taking part in an action against his standing orders in involvement in any combat role  Klaus persuaded his friends to let him go on the torpedo boat S 141 for a raid on Selsey on his twenty fourth birthday  The boat was sunk by the French ship La Combattante and Klaus died  though six others were rescued   7  In popular culture  Karl Dönitz has been portrayed by the following actors in film  television and theatre productions   Gert Hänsch in
