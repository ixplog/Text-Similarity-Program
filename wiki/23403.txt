The indigenous population of Papua New Guinea is one of the most heterogeneous in the world  Papua New Guinea has several thousand separate communities  most with only a few hundred people  Divided by language  customs  and tradition  some of these communities have engaged in endemic warfare with their neighbors for centuries   The isolation created by the mountainous terrain is so great that some groups  until recently  were unaware of the existence of neighboring groups only a few kilometers away  The diversity  reflected in a folk saying   For each village  a different culture   is perhaps best shown in the local languages  Spoken mainly on the island of New Guinea  about 650 of these Papuan languages have been identified  of these  only 350 450 are related  The remainder of the Papuan languages seem to be totally unrelated either to each other or to the other major groupings  In addition  many languages belonging to Austronesian language group are used in Papua New Guinea  and in total  more than 800 languages are spoken in Papua New Guinea  Native languages are spoken by a few hundred to a few thousand  although Enga language  used in Enga Province  is spoken by some 130 000 people   Tok Pisin serves as the lingua franca  English is the language of business and government  and all schooling from Grade 2 Primary is in English   The overall population density is low  although pockets of overpopulation exist  Papua New Guinea s Western Province averages one person per square kilometer  3 per sq  mi    The Simbu Province in the New Guinea highlands averages 20 persons per square kilometer  60 per sq  mi   and has areas containing up to 200 people farming a square kilometer of land  The highlands have 40% of the population   A considerable urban drift towards Port Moresby and other major centers has occurred in recent years  Between 1978 and 1988  Port Moresby grew nearly 8% per year  Lae 6%  Mount Hagen 6 5%  Goroka 4%  and Madang 3%  The trend toward urbanization accelerated in the 1990s  bringing in its wake squatter settlements  unemployment  and attendant social problems  Almost two thirds of the population is Christian  Of these  more than 700 000 are Roman Catholic  more than 500 000 Lutheran  and the balance are members of other Protestant denominations  Although the major churches are under indigenous leadership  a large number of missionaries remain in the country  The non Christian portion of the indigenous population practices a wide variety of religions that are an integral part of traditional culture  mainly animism  spirit worship  and ancestor cults   Foreign residents are just over 1% of the population  More than half are Australian  others are from the United Kingdom  New Zealand  the Philippines  and the United States  Since independence  about 900 foreigners have become naturalized citizens   The traditional Papua New Guinea social structure includes the following characteristics   The practice of subsistence economy   Recognition of bonds of kinship with obligations extending beyond the immediate family group   Generally egalitarian relationships with an emphasis on acquired  rather than inherited  status  and  A strong attachment of the people to land  Most Papua New Guineans still adhere strongly to this traditional social structure  which has its roots in village life   1  CIA
