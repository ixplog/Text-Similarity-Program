Vodun  meaning spirit in the Fon and Ewe languages  with a nasal high tone u  also spelled Vodon  Vodoun  Vodou  Voudou  Voodoo  etc   is practised by the Ewe people of eastern and southern Ghana  and southern and central Togo  and the Kabye people  Mina people  and Fon people of southern and central Togo  southern and central Benin   It is distinct from the various African traditional religions in the interiors of these countries and is the main source of religions with similar names found among the African Diaspora in the New World such as Haitian Vodou  Puerto Rican Vudu  Cuban Vudu  Dominican Vudú  Brazilian Vodum  and Louisiana Voodoo  All of these closely related faiths are syncretized with Christianity to various degrees and with the traditional beliefs of the Kongo people and Indigenous American traditions   1  Theology and practice  Vodun cosmology centers around the vodun spirits and other elements of divine essence that govern the Earth  a hierarchy that range in power from major deities governing the forces of nature and human society to the spirits of individual streams  trees  and rocks  as well as dozens of ethnic vodun  defenders of a certain clan  tribe  or nation  The vodun are the center of religious life  similarly in many ways to doctrines such as the intercession of saints and angels that made Vodun appear compatible with Christianity  especially Catholicism  and produced syncretic religions such as Haitian Vodou  Adherents also emphasize ancestor worship and hold that the spirits of the dead live side by side with the world of the living  each family of spirits having its own female priesthood  sometimes hereditary when is from mother to blood daughter   Patterns of worship follow various dialects  spirits  practices  songs  and rituals  A divine Creator  called variously Mawu is a female being who in one tradition bore seven children and gave each rule over a realm of nature   animals  earth  and sea   or else these children are inter ethnic and related to natural phenomena or to historical or mythical individuals  The Creator embodies a dual cosmogonic principle of which Mawu the moon and Lisa the sun are respectively the female and male aspects  often portrayed as the twin children of the Creator   In other traditions  Legba is represented as Mawu s masculine counterpart  thus being represented as a phallus or as a man with a prominent phallus  Dan  who is Mawu s androgynous son  is represented as a rainbow serpent  and was to remain with her and act as a go between with her other creations  As the mediator between the spirits and the living  Dan maintains balance  order  peace and communication   All creation is considered divine and therefore contains the power of the divine  This is how medicines such as herbal remedies are understood  and explains the ubiquitous use of mundane objects in religious ritual  Vodun talismans  called  fetishes   are objects such as statues or dried animal parts that are sold for their healing and spiritually rejuvenating properties   1 1  Priests  Often described as queen mother is the first daughter of a patriarchal lineage of a family collective  She holds the right to lead the ceremonies incumbent to the clan  marriages  baptisms and funerals  She is considered one of the most important members of community  She will lead the women of a village when her family collective is the ruling one  Her dominant role has often been confused or associated to that of a high priestess which she is not  They take part in the organisation and the running of markets and are also responsible for their upkeep  which is vitally important because marketplaces are the focal points for gatherings and social centres in their communities  In the past when the men of the villages would go to war  the Queen Mothers would lead prayer ceremonies in which all the women attended every morning to ensure the safe return of their menfolk   The High priestess is  on the other hand  the woman chosen by the oracle to care for the convent   Priestesses  like priests  receive a calling from an oracle  which may come at any moment during their lives  They will then join their clan s convent to pursue spiritual instruction  It is also an oracle that will designate the future high priest and high priestess among the new recruits  establishing an order of succession within the convent  Only blood relatives were allowed in the family convent  strangers are forbidden  In modern days  however  some of the rules have been changed  enabling non family members to enter what is described as the first circle of worship  Strangers are allowed to worship only the spirits of the standard pantheon   2  Relationship to Bò  Confusion and an amalgam are often made between Vodun and Bò also called O bò or Juju in Yoruba  Bò is an occult science whose priest are called Bòkônon or Bòkôtônon in opposition to Vodunsi  Vodun female priestess  and Vodunon  Vodun male priest   Contrary to popular beliefs  in West African Vodun  spells are not cast upon someone  Vodun is a religion in which an important part is devoted to the cult of the ancestors  Even if the origin of humanity and the world are explained in Vodun mythology  it is not a centered question of the faith  The followers believe that the answer to such question is beyond human reach  Priority is given to the ancestors with them interceding on behalf of their families and descendant towards the Almighty  While an Almighty creator is recognized in Vodun pantheon  the believers do not address themselves to that particular deity  Only the Loas  the messengers with the help of the dead have that access  In order to communicate and pray every clan and sometimes each family root have their own Vodun sometimes called Assanyì as Vodun can also be translated as  The spirit of those who have passed before us   The family Vodun is often associated with a known higher spirit of the standard pantheon  but is distinctive to each family  clan   This distinctiveness is the Clan Vodun is also an assertion of identity and origin with cult and worshiping process specific to a family collective   The occult science of Bô is not Vodun  although it often summons spirits issued from the Vodun pantheon in its process  The amalgam probably occurred through foreign observation and explanation of the rituals of Vodun  It is due to the fact that Vodun elements can be seen in the rituals of Bò   The general perception of west African Vodun today is based on a perception of Bò  Juju in Yoruba   European witchcraft and misunderstanding of the practice   3  Demographics  About 17% of the population of Benin  some 1 6 million people  follow Vodun   This does not count other traditional religions in Benin   In addition  many of the 41 5% of the population that refer to themselves as Christian practice a syncretized religion  not dissimilar from Haitian Vodou or Brazilian Candomblé  indeed  many of them are descended from freed Brazilian slaves who settled on the coast near Ouidah   In Togo  about half the population practices indigenous religions  of which Vodun is by far the largest  with some 2 5 million followers  there may be another million Vodunists among the Ewe of Ghana  as a 13% of the total Ghana population of 20 million are Ewe and 38% of Ghanaians practise traditional religion  According to census data  about 14 million people practise traditional religion in Nigeria  most of whom are Yoruba practising Ifá  but no specific breakdown is available   European colonialism  followed by some of the totalitarian regimes in West Africa  have tried to suppress Vodun as well as other African indigenous religions  However  because the vodun deities are born to each clan  tribe  and nation  and their clergy are central to maintaining the moral  social and political order and ancestral foundation of its village  these efforts have not been successful  Recently there have been moves to restore the place of Vodun in national society  such as an annual International Vodun Conference held in the city of Ouidah in Benin that has been held since 1991   4
