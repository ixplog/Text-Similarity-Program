The Jedi are a monastic  spiritual  and academic organization in the fictional Star Wars universe  and dates back to at least 10 000 years before the destruction of the first Death Star  The fictional organization has inspired a religion in the real world  Jediism   Its members  most notably known as Jedi Knights  as depicted in the franchise s Jedi canon  serve and utilize a mystical power called the Force in order to help and protect those in need  For many generations  they served as a paramilitary for the Galactic Republic and the galaxy at large to prevent conflict and political instability including playing a leading role in the later Clone Wars   As sanctioned guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy  they mediated negotiations among planets and rival factions and  if necessary  use their formidable martial art skills  agility and wisdom to quickly end unrest or neutralize dangerous individuals or threats  The Jedi are governed by a Council  consisting of twelve of the wisest and most powerful  force sensitive  members of the Jedi Order  They are bound to a code of ethics  morality  principles  honor and justice   The Jedi are trained to use the Force through deistic reasoning  passive meditation and applied academics  They are proactive in the virtues of abstinence  altruism  mercy  gaman  and the commitment to justice  They are conditioned to reject negative or dangerous emotions  such as love  passion  greed  fear  anger and hate   Their traditional weapon is the lightsaber  a device which emits a blade like controlled plasma flow   The Jedi s self denial philosophical way of life contrasts with their archenemies  the Sith  another monastic organization who used the dark side of the Force to embrace passion and individualism as a means of achieving personal goals of freedom  power and victory over physical restrictions and thereby attain perfection   1  Etymology  The word  jedi  is thought to have been derived by George Lucas from the Japanese word jidaigeki  a genre of historical dramas  such as The Hidden Fortress  which influenced the development of Star Wars   2  Background and origins  The Jedi are first introduced in the 1977 motion picture Star Wars Episode IV  A New Hope as an order of warrior monks who serve as  the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy  and embrace the mystical Force  Obi Wan Kenobi  Alec Guinness  explains that the Galactic Empire had all but exterminated the Jedi some twenty years before the events of the film  and seeks to train Luke Skywalker  Mark Hamill  to be the Order s last hope  Darth Vader  David Prowse James Earl Jones  is also established as the Jedi s main enemy  By the end of the film  Luke is on the path to becoming a Jedi  In the sequel  The Empire Strikes Back  Luke receives extensive Jedi training from the elderly  and only surviving  Jedi Master Yoda  Frank Oz   even as he learns that Vader is in fact his father  former Jedi Anakin Skywalker  The third film in the original trilogy  Return of the Jedi  ends with Luke redeeming Vader and helping to destroy the Empire  thus fulfilling his destiny as a Jedi   The prequel films depict the Jedi in their prime  dealing with the rising presence of the dark side of the Force and determined to fight their mortal enemies  the Sith  In Star Wars Episode I  The Phantom Menace  1999   Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn  Liam Neeson  discovers nine year old Anakin Skywalker  Jake Lloyd   whom he believes to be the  Chosen One  of a Jedi prophecy who is destined to bring balance to the Force  the boy is eventually paired with Qui Gon s apprentice  the young Obi Wan Kenobi  Ewan McGregor   who promises to train him  The sequel  Attack of the Clones  establishes that the Jedi forswear all emotional attachments  including romantic love  which proves problematic when Anakin  now a young adult  Hayden Christensen   falls in love with Padmé Amidala  Natalie Portman   whom Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi had served ten years before  In Revenge of the Sith  Palpatine  Ian McDiarmid   who is later revealed to be the Sith Lord Darth Sidious  manipulates Anakin s love for Padmé and distrust of the Jedi in order to turn him to the dark side and become his Sith apprentice  Darth Vader  Once corrupted  Vader helps Palpatine hunt down and destroy nearly all of the Jedi  leaving very few left  such as Jedi Master Yoda and Obi Wan Kenobi   The Jedi s history before and after the timeline of the films is established within several novels  comic books and video games in the Expanded Universe of Star Wars media   2 1  Order  66  For crimes of  high treason  against the Republic  the Jedi are nearly exterminated by order of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious to the Clone Army  with only Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda among a handful of others surviving  The first person to be issued this order was Clone Commander Cody  who until then was under the command of Jedi General Kenobi    2 2  The New Jedi Order  In novels set after the events of the original trilogy film series  The New Jedi Order was the restored and reformed Jedi organization  in the wake of the Great Jedi Purge and subsequent fall of the Galactic Empire  The Jedi Knights  reduced in number to only a handful  were slowly restored  primarily under the leadership of Grandmaster Luke Skywalker  Luke Skywalker abolished the traditional Master Padawan system  He believed all Jedi should be both teachers and students  that they should both learn from and mentor each other  and not just from one Master  Luke Skywalker re established the Jedi High Council as part of his New Jedi Order  Half of the council are made up of Jedi  while the other half consist of politicians  Following the Yuuzhan Vong War  the Jedi withdrew their support from any one political entity and relocated to The Great Library of Ossus  where a full Jedi Council was re established   3  Organization  3 1  Jedi Temple  In the Star Wars prequel trilogy saga  the Jedi Temple is located in the capital planet of Coruscant  It is the headquarters  academy  library  and monastery of the Jedi Order   In Revenge of the Sith  the temple is attacked  Even though the temple was severely damaged and most of the Jedi perished  it was not completely destroyed  and is visible in the celebrations on Coruscant at the end of Return of the Jedi over twenty years later  The New Jedi Order indicates that the Jedi Temple on Coruscant is no longer standing but it is rebuilt as a gift to Jedi for their services and achievements during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion  The new temple is in the form of a massive pyramid made from stone and transparisteel that is designed to fit into the new look of Coruscant  though internally it is identical to the design seen in Revenge of the Sith   Architects Journal rated the temple third on its top ten architecture of Star Wars list behind the second Death Star and Jabba the Hutt’s palace on Tatooine  and ahead of Coruscant  capital city of the Old Republic  The temple is described in the article as adapting  the robust typology of Mayan temples  with durasteel cladding specified for the external stone walls for improved defensive strength  and said to be a ziggurat that  is built above a Force nexus and has ample room for training facilities  accommodation and the Jedi Archive   The temple has five towers  the tallest is Tranquillity Spire  that are stylistically similar to the minarets surrounding the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul  Star Wars Insider listed it as the one hundredth greatest thing about Star Wars in its one hundredth issue special   3 2  Jedi Archives  The Jedi Archives  known as the The Great Library of Ossus or The Great Library of the Jedi  contained the galaxy s most priceless and ancient of texts sacred to Jedi scholars and archaeologists  The original archives was a massive library and training ground erected by the Jedi Order on the planet Ossus  Commissioned by the Jedi Master Odan Urr following the Great Hyperspace War  the Draethos Jedi assembled ancient documents and scrolls detailing every detail of sentient history and ingenuity  Home to the Order after leaving their homeworld Tython in the Deep Core  the Great Library of Ossus became a symbol of the Jedi and the greatest storehouse of knowledge in the galaxy  Over the ensuing centuries Ossus thrived as the home of Jedi wisdom  encouraging visitors from across the Galactic Republic to visit and study at the archives   After centuries of peace and growth  the Library was raided by Exar Kun  the Dark Lord of the Sith  and his Sith followers  Storming the  Chamber of Antiquities   the Sith stole the forbidden Sith artifact  known as the Dark Holocron  from Master Odan Urr before slaying the venerable Jedi  As Kun grew stronger and gathered his forces  the Sith unleashed the devastation of Naga Sadow s ancient battleship  the Corsair  detonating the stars of the nearby Cron Cluster in 3996 BBY   As the Jedi desperately tried to empty the Library and ship its contents offworld  Kun and his minions returned in a bid to steal the last bits of knowledge from the Jedi  Before long  the world was irradiated by the supernovas  eradicating the planet s major cities and entombing more than half of the Library s knowledge within its halls  The Library stood abandoned for the next three millennia  while the surviving Ysanna Jedi kept constant vigil in the ruined world  The Jedi who made it offworld transported the surviving artifacts to Coruscant  they were kept in the new Archives that served as a smaller version of the lost Library for centuries  These Coruscant archives would later be destroyed by Yoda  as to prevent them being pilfered and exploited by Palpatine during the Great Jedi Purge  Luke Skywalker and Kam Solusar rediscovered the world and begun to study the ruins  After several decades more had past  the Jedi Order returned to the now habitable planet and established a new academy on the world  erecting a new Archives to replace the Great Library   3 3  Jedi Academy  The Jedi academies were established to train Force sensitive beings accepted into the Jedi Order in the ways of the Force  Overseen by the Council of First Knowledge  each academy was governed by an advisory Council appointed by their superiors on Coruscant  Mainstreaming the majority of teachings at the Temple  certain practices were permitted to vary from world to world  However  at all sanctioned academies  a group of Jedi Masters would instruct Initiates to the Order in the ways of the Force  The size of the school varied from world to world  some as small as to consist of a single clan of younglings  and as the large as the main academy housed within the Jedi Temple of Coruscant  Many academies had been established during the Old Sith Wars and were located in the Galactic Rim  Some were located on or near Force wellsprings or places significant to the Order like crystal caves or nexuses of dark side energies that needed constant monitoring   In addition to the traditional academies established by the Order  the Exploration Corps maintained several spacefaring mobile academies such as the Chu unthor so that roaming the galaxy and exploring new worlds could be achieved while still teaching traditional doctrine   By the fall of the Galactic Republic in 19 BBY  many of the ancient academies had been shut down for decades  with the Council of First Knowledge preferring the central teachings of the Coruscant Temple  After the dissolution of the Order during the Great Jedi Purge  all orthodox Temples and academies were routed and burned in order to prevent any more Jedi from learning the secrets of the Force  However  the Galactic Empire s choke hold on Force education did not last and the Order was reformed following the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War  When Grand Master Luke Skywalker began to expand his Order from a single class to the size of the old Order  he opened several old academies  as well as new facilities to promote education and growth within the Order   4  Personnel  4 1  Jedi Council  4 2  Rank structure  4 2 1  Hierarchy  Members of the Order progress through four tiers of rank  at times referred to as levels   Jedi Initiate  An Initiate is the first part of Jedi training  and was typically a Youngling  a child Jedi in training  receiving first class education from Jedi Masters while learning to control the Force and wield a lightsaber  Younglings were seen training under Jedi Master Yoda in a scene on Attack of the Clones and hiding during the assault on the Jedi Temple in Revenge of the Sith   Jedi Padawan  A Youngling who successfully completes training is given a second class education and then undergoes Padawan training under the tutelage of Mentor  usually a Jedi Knight or Jedi Master   They are also called  Apprentices  and  Padawan learners   As a rite of passage and the final test before the trials to knighthood  Padawans must build their own lightsabers  In the Old Republic  Padawans usually wore a hair braid on the right side of their head which was removed with a lightsaber upon attaining knighthood  They also served as Commanders in the Clone Wars  The term Padawan appears to originate in Sanskrit and can be understood as “learner   both in Sanskrit and by contemporary native speakers of Sanskrit based languages   Jedi Knight  Disciplined and experienced  Jedi Knights become so only when they have completed  the trials   final tests  and may continue to pursue a third class education  see below   As the most common rank  it is interchangeably referred to as  Jedi    Jedi Knight  and  Master Jedi   although the latter are honorifics used only by Younglings and Padawans when addressing Jedi Knights or above    Master Jedi  is also a term of respect used by beings who respect the Jedi  The five tests are usually known as Trial of Skill  the Trial of Courage  the Trial of the Flesh  the Trial of Spirit  and the Trial of Insight  or Knowledge   In Return of the Jedi  Master Yoda gives his apprentice  Luke Skywalker  the trial of confronting Darth Vader for a second time so he might become a full fledged Knight  Occasionally  performing an extraordinary  usually heroic  act can earn a Padawan learner Jedi status  such as when Obi Wan Kenobi defeats the Sith Lord Darth Maul  By the time of the movies distinct battle classes were not necessary as the Republic had not seen war in over a thousand years  and the title of Knight was simply a rank once again   Jedi Master  A Jedi Knight may become a Jedi Master after successfully training a Padawan learner to Knight status  Though this is the most common manner  there are other ways of attaining the rank   4 2 2  Classes and specialists  Upon a Padawan s ascension to Knighthood status  a Jedi pursued additional training in a field of expertise  Choosing based on preference and personal talents and skills  the opportunity to join the ranks of the Jedi Guardian  Jedi Consular  or Jedi Sentinel was open to all who passed the Jedi Trials  In addition to their specialization  the High Council could demand that the members of the Order assume military ranks in order to defend the Republic   Jedi Guardian  Jedi Guardians focused all aspects of combat as an extension of their being  and trained on combining and perfecting their athletic  aviation and martial art skills with mastery of the Force  The Force skills studied by the Guardians were typically those used for quickly disabling an opponent and aiding in agility and stamina  Many were stationed within Republic planetary or sectoral government s security agencies where they worked as special peacekeepers and law enforcement agents  helping to quell riots and capture terrorists  The highest ranking Jedi Guardians were stationed at the Jedi academies as instructors tasked with passing down their experience to the young students of the Order  Those Jedi who mastered lightsaber combat techniques  such as Mace Windu  were dubbed Weapon Masters and were among the greatest warriors of the Order    Jedi Sentinel  Jedi Sentinels focused on lightsaber combat primarily  honing their skills to the point where they can dual wield lightsabers fluently   Jedi Consular  Jedi Consulars focused on further mastery of the Force and the sharpening of mental faculties  and wielded a lightsaber only for self defense  Overseen by the Council of Reconciliation  Jedi Consulars were often called upon to act as impartial advisers  diplomats  and historians  Most Consulars specialized as historians  archivists  librarians  archaeology  geology  biology  mathematics  and astronomy  they contributed to the growth and preservation of the Jedi Archives as  Lore Keepers  directed by the Librarian s Assembly  Some Consulars worked closely with the Republic bureaucrats to assist in greeting unaligned governments and helping them join the Republic and given the authority to hammer out a compromise or treaty during tense negotiations  backed by the full support of the Senate and Jedi Order  Some Consulars joined the Circle of Jedi Healers  headquartered out of the Coruscant Temple s Halls of Healing  and focused on the medical and humanitarian aspects of the Force  manipulating the Living Force to perform the art of healing  Those Jedi specifically predisposed to receive visions through the Force were known as  Seers   maintaining and updating the Order s holocrons  the most perceptive of these Jedi  such as Yoda  were known as Prophets and foretold the future of the galaxy  There are two additional tiers exclusive to Jedi Masters who serve on the Jedi High Council   Jedi Master of the High Council  The Master of the High Council is elected by the Jedi High Council to chair its meetings and serve as the Grand Master s junior partner in charge of the day to day administration of the order   Jedi Grand Master of the Order  The Grand Master is usually the oldest  most experienced and best trained of all Jedi  A Grand Master is chosen by the Jedi High Council to provide direction and guidance to the entire Jedi Order   4 3  Notable Jedi  4 3 1  Yoda  Yoda  Grand Master of the Jedi Order  was the oldest known Prophet  at least 900+ years  in existence  and considered the wisest and most powerful Jedi Master within the Star Wars universe  Yoda had mentored or trained almost every known Youngling  Padawan  and Jedi Master in the Jedi Temple throughout his years as a Jedi Grand Master  which includes  Count Dooku  Mace Windu  Obi Wan Kenobi  Ki Adi Mundi  Kit Fisto  Oppo Rancisis  and Luke Skywalker   4 3 2  Mace Windu  Mace Windu  Jedi Master of the High Council  is a Weapons Master and one of the last members of the order s upper echelons before the fall of the Galactic Republic  Windu was the most powerful Jedi and the greatest swordsman of his time  able to defeat Darth Sidious in lightsaber combat  a feat which even Yoda could not achieve  Windu had the unique talent of seeing  shatterpoints   or faultlines in the Force that could affect the destinies of certain individuals  and indeed the galaxy itself   4 3 3  Qui Gon Jinn  Qui Gon Jinn is a wise and powerful Jedi Master and the teacher of Obi Wan Kenobi  Unlike other  more conservative Jedi  he values living in the moment as the best way to embrace the Force  While other Jedi respect him highly  they are frequently puzzled by his unorthodox beliefs and ultimately deny him a seat on the Jedi Council despite being among the most powerful of the Jedi   4 3 4  Obi Wan Kenobi  Obi Wan Kenobi is the one who initiates Luke Skywalker to the Jedi arts and serves as a central character during the events of the Clone Wars  Obi Wan proved himself an adept strategist and spy  as his leadership style heavily favored subterfuge and misdirection while commanding clone troopers  or wielding the Lightsaber and The Force   4 3 5  Luke Skywalker  Luke Skywalker  padawan to the Jedi master Obi Wan  Ben  Kenobi  became an important figure in the Rebel Alliance s struggle against the Galactic Empire  He is heir to a family deeply powerful in the Force  the twin brother of Rebellion leader Princess Leia of the planet Alderaan  and the son of former Queen of Naboo and Republic Senator Padmé Amidala and fallen Jedi turned Sith Lord Darth Vader  Anakin Skywalker   A powerful Jedi Master and eventually the Grand Master of the New Jedi Order  the father of Ben Skywalker  the maternal uncle of Jacen Solo and Jaina Solo and the ancestor of Cade Skywalker   4 3 6  Mara Jade Skywalker  Mara Jade Skywalker is wife to Luke Skywalker  and mother to Ben Skywalker  Mara originally served as a hand of the Emperor before turning to the light  She was murdered by Darth Caedus   4 3 7  Leia Organa Solo  Leia Organa Solo  twin sister of Luke Skywalker  wife of Han Solo  and the daughter of Darth Vader  Anakin Skywalker  and Padmé Amidala   4 3 8  Jaina Solo Fel  Jaina Solo Fel  wife of Jagged Fel  and the eldest child of Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo  She is also the elder twin of Jacen by five minutes and the sister of Anakin Solo  She pursued a life separate from her twin brother and becomes Mara Jade Skywalker s apprentice  Jaina progressed quickly as a Jedi and a pilot  eventually joining Rogue Squadron  She briefly becomes the apprentice of fallen Jedi Kyp Durron  Jaina s understanding and manipulation of Yuuzhan Vong technology causes them to associate her with their  trickster goddess   In Legacy of the Force  she senses a growing darkness in her twin  In Betrayal  Jacen falls to the dark side of the Force  and Jaina realizes her duty as the  Sword of the Jedi  requires her to stop him  She turns to Boba Fett to train her  In Invincible  Jaina duels and kills Jacen   5  Equipment  Within the Star Wars universe  the Jedi are usually portrayed wearing simple robes and carrying specialized field gear for their missions   5 1  Weapons  The most notable instrument wielded by a Jedi is the Lightsaber  Both Jedi and Sith use lightsabers as their main weapon  The Jedi s lightsabers emit cool colors  usually blue or green blades  sometimes yellow  or purple  as seen in the case of Mace Windu   while the Sith emit warm colors  Lightsabers can be of many different colors depending on the crystal fixture  Although a Jedi s class used to be defined by the color of the lightsaber  by the events of the theatrical trilogy films  most Jedi choose to make their lightsaber any color they see fit  Most Jedi use naturally formed crystals  whereas Sith tend to use synthetic crystals  which are usually red in color   5 2  Vehicles  Eta 2 Actis Jedi Interceptors first appeared in Revenge of the Sith  Delta 7B Aethersprite Jedi starfighters appear in Star Wars Episode II  Attack of the Clones and Star Wars Episode III  Revenge of the Sith  In Attack of the Clones  Obi Wan Kenobi travels via Jedi starfighter to Kamino to investigate the attempted assassination of Padmé Amidala  he also flies a Jedi starfighter to Geonosis in an attempt to track down the bounty hunter Jango Fett  Lacking a hyperdrive  the starfighter relies on an external sled to propel it through hyperspace  Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker  Hayden Christensen  fly updated Jedi starfighters  called Jedi Interceptors  in the opening sequence of Revenge of the Sith  Later  Plo Koon  Matt Sloan  flies an Attack of the Clones era starfighter when he is shot down by clone troopers carrying out Emperor Palpatine s  Ian McDiarmid  Order 66   The Jedi starfighter s triangular shape in Attack of the Clones stems from the shape of Imperial Star Destroyers in the original Star Wars trilogy  Industrial Light & Magic designer Doug Chiang identified the Jedi starfighter as one of the first designs that bridges the aesthetic between the prequel and original trilogies  Chiang noted that viewers  familiarity with the Star Destroyer s appearance and Imperial affiliation gives added symbolism to the Jedi craft s appearance and foreshadows the Empire s rise to power  The starfighter seen in Revenge of the Sith is a cross between the previous film s vessel and the Empire s TIE fighters from the original trilogy  Hasbro s expanding wings in the Attack of the Clones Jedi starfighter toy inspired the opening wings in the Revenge of the Sith vessel  The starfighter in the Revenge of the Sith is called a Jedi Interceptor Starfighter   6  Dark Jedi and the Sith  Dark Jedi is the unofficial name given in the Star Wars universe to antihero fictional characters attuned to the Force and adept in its dark side  The concept of  Dark Jedi  is not endorsed anywhere within the movie trilogies  They exist by that name only in the Expanded Universe  including video games such as Star Wars  Knights of the Old Republic and the Star Wars  Jedi Knight series  the term is never used in any of the six Star Wars films  So called Grey Jedi and Rogue Jedi are terms that refers to Jedi who don t follow the Jedi Code and or the decisions of the Jedi Council  or who have defected from the Jedi Order and or have rejected the Jedi Philosophical concepts of  Lightside  versus  Darkside   Fallen Jedi refers to former Jedi turned Sith who were seduced by the Dark Side  such as Revan or Anakin Skywalker    Dark Jedi and Grey Jedi are a label to a specific archetype of characters in the Star Wars Expanded Universe defined as Force attuned beings that meet two requirements   They do not hold themselves to the dogma of either the Jedi or the Sith   They use their Force abilities for less than virtuous pursuits   Acts that are normally forbidden by the Jedi Order   Dark Jedi in the Expanded Universe typically refer to pupils of Luke Skywalker s Jedi Academy who have fallen victim to the dark side  Dark Jedi are also extremely common in the Knights of the Old Republic series in league with the Sith Empire and are often fallen Jedi from the Mandalorian Wars  Dark Jedi also appear in the Jedi Knight series of Star Wars video games  where Kyle Katarn uncovers Imperial plots linked to Dark Jedi  In Jedi Outcast  Katarn faces an entire army of Dark Jedi  cloned and lightly trained force users who follow the main antagonist  Dark Jedi have distanced from Sith in more modern Star Wars media  They are not sworn enemies of the Jedi Order and do not consider destroying it a priority as Sith do  Dark Jedi do not always appear in pairs with a master and apprentice and often work alone   Because the term Sith was never spoken in the original trilogy  although Darth Vader was described as  Lord of the Sith  in the published screenplay   early Expanded Universe products usually considered the  evil Jedi   those who joined the dark side of the Force  as  Dark Jedi   In his novel series The Thrawn Trilogy  author Timothy Zahn labeled Sith Lord Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine as Dark Jedi  and the term  Sith  was never mentioned in the series until later reprints of the novels   6 1  Common usage  Dark Jedi use the Force for their own ends while attempting to utilize both sides of the Force  owing no allegiance  They do not exclusively bond themselves to either the light or dark sides of the Force  While a Dark Jedi can use Jedi and Sith Force arts with ease  they rarely obtain the mastery of either side  Force sensitive individuals seem to arise spontaneously and may become adept at the Force without Jedi or Sith involvement  Many notable Dark Jedi have received at least some Jedi training   Palpatine did not consider himself bound by Sith traditions  he had begun training his first apprentice  Darth Maul  prior to the death of his own Master  Darth Plagueis  which was a violation of Darth Bane s Rule of Two  Under Imperial rule  Palpatine trained many Force sensitive beings in the ways of the dark side of the Force  but most were never initiated into the rites and secrets of the Sith  Palpatine planned to eventually do away with the Rule of Two entirely in order to have legions of Sith spies  assassins  and bodyguards at his disposal   While most Dark Jedi may believe themselves to be acting for a  greater good   the Dark Side of the Force s influence ultimately leads to self destruction  as was the case when Ulic Qel Droma  Revan  and Anakin fell to the dark side of the Force   regardless of the motives or misguided morals of those who use it  Mara Jade is another primary example of a Dark Jedi who served evil  but still mistakenly believed her actions to be justified  Eventually  she turned from the dark side  but still carried the teachings of the Emperor with her  such as her lightsaber techniques  Contrary to the Jedi method of purging emotion via meditation and training  Dark Jedi  like Sith  allow their emotions to empower them   Mace Windu is a unique case and the only known exception  He created and mastered a style of Lightsaber combat called Vaapad  Form VII   in which the combatant maintains meditation while simultaneously harnessing the Dark Side — without giving into its temptations — by actually enjoying the fight and the thrill of victory   All others who attempted to master the form either gave in to the dark side or were unable to properly master the technique    7  In popular culture  The United States Army had a group of officers in the early 1980s who promoted maneuver warfare tactics  and who were derisively referred to as Jedi by more conventional officers who were satisfied with attrition tactics and methods   Jedi Knights have made their way into certain areas of pop culture  such as in   Weird Al  Yankovic s song  The Saga Begins   a parody of  American Pie   The Jedi influence begins with the lyrics from  American Pie   This ll be the day that I die changed to Soon I m gonna be a Jedi   The 2009 film The Men Who Stare at Goats stars Ewan McGregor as a reporter named Bob Wilton who follows a former soldier  George Clooney  who claimed to be a  Jedi warrior   a nickname for psychic spies in the US military  McGregor previously starred as Jedi Knight  and later Jedi Master  Obi Wan Kenobi in the prequel trilogy   7 1  Religion  One of the enduring influences the Star Wars saga has had in popular culture is the idea of the fictional Jedi values being interpreted as a modern philosophical path or religion  spawning various movements such as the Jediism  religious  and the Jedi census phenomenon   8  See also  Sith  Jediism  9  Notes and references  10  External links
