WordStar is a word processor application that had a dominant market share during the early  to mid 1980s  Formerly published by MicroPro International  it was originally written for the CP M operating system but later ported to DOS  Although Seymour I  Rubinstein was the principal owner of the company  Rob Barnaby was the sole author of the early versions of the program  Starting with WordStar 4 0  the program was built on new code written principally by Peter Mierau   WordStar was deliberately written to make as few assumptions about the underlying system as possible  allowing it to be easily ported across the many platforms that proliferated in the early 1980s  As all of these versions had relatively similar commands and controls  users could move between platforms with equal ease  Already popular  its inclusion with the Osborne 1 computer made the program become the de facto standard for much of the word processing market   As the computer market quickly became dominated by the IBM PC  this same portable design made it difficult for the program to add new features and affected its performance  In spite of its great popularity in the early 1980s  these problems allowed WordPerfect to take WordStar s place as the most widely used word processor from 1985 onwards   1  History  1 1  Founding  Seymour I  Rubinstein was an employee of early microcomputer company IMSAI  where he negotiated software contracts with Digital Research and Microsoft  After leaving IMSAI  Rubinstein planned to start his own software company that would sell through the new network of retail computer stores  He founded MicroPro International Corporation in September 1978 and hired John Robbins Barnaby as programmer  who wrote a word processor  WordMaster  and a sorting program  SuperSort  in Intel 8080 assembly language  After Rubinstein obtained a report that discussed the abilities of contemporary standalone word processors from IBM  Xerox  and Wang Laboratories  Barnaby enhanced WordMaster with similar features and support for the CP M operating system  MicroPro began selling the product  now renamed WordStar  in June 1979  By early 1980  MicroPro claimed in advertisements that 5 000 people had purchased WordStar in eight months   1 2  Early success  WordStar was the first microcomputer word processor to offer mail merge and WYSIWYG  An exhausted Barnaby left the company in March 1980  but due to WordStar s sophistication  the company s extensive sales and marketing efforts  and bundling deals with Osborne and other computer makers  MicroPro s sales grew from $500 000 in 1979 to $72 million in fiscal year 1984  surpassing earlier market leader Electric Pencil  Despite a manual that PC Magazine described as  incredibly inadequate   which led many authors to publish replacements  by May 1983 BYTE magazine called WordStar  without a doubt the best known and probably the most widely used personal computer word processing program   The company released WordStar 3 3 in June 1983  the 650 000 cumulative copies of WordStar for the IBM PC and other computers sold by that fall was more than double that of the second most popular word processor  and that year MicroPro had 10% of the personal computer software market  By 1984  the year it held an initial public offering  MicroPro was the world s largest software company with 23% of the word processor market   1 3  DOS  WordStar 3 0  the first version for MS DOS  appeared in April 1982  The DOS version was very similar to the original  and although the IBM PC had arrow keys and separate function keys  the traditional  WordStar diamond  and other Ctrl key functions were retained  leading to rapid adoption by former CP M users  WordStar s ability to use a  non document  mode to create text files without formatting made it popular among programmers for writing code  Like the CP M versions  the DOS WordStar was not explicitly designed for IBM PCs  but rather for any x86 machine  as there were a number of non PCs that used 8086 or 186 CPUs   As such  it used only DOS s OS calls and avoided any BIOS usage or direct hardware access   The first DOS version was a port of the CP M 86 version  and therefore only used 64k of RAM even though DOS supported up to 640k  Users quickly learned they could make this version of WordStar run dramatically faster by using the ability of DOS to create a RAM disk in memory  and copy the WordStar program files into it  WordStar would still access the  disk  repeatedly  but the far faster access of the RAM drive compared to a floppy disk yielded a substantial speed improvement  However  edited versions of a document were  saved  only to this RAM disk  and had to be copied to physical magnetic media before rebooting   By 1983  WordStar was the leading word processing system  Although competition appeared early  the first version of WordPerfect debuted in 1982 and Microsoft Word in 1983   WordStar was the dominant word processor on x86 machines until 1985  It was part of the software bundle that accompanied Kaypro computers   At that time  the evolution from CP M to MS DOS  with an  Alt  key  had taken place  WordStar never successfully exploited the MS DOS keyboard  and that is one explanation for its demise   By that point  MicroPro had dropped the generic MS DOS WordStar and version 4 0 was exclusively for IBM compatibles   IBM compatibles differed from MS DOS compatible programs in the addresses assigned to its screen data   However  it continued to use the old DOS 1 x OS calls  which did not support directories and limited its usability on machines with hard disks  During the second half of the 1980s  the fully modernized WordPerfect overtook it in sales   There were also WordStar 5  5 5  6  and 7   1 4  WordStar 2000  At the time  IBM dominated the  dedicated word processor  market with its  IBM Displaywriter System   which ran on machines dedicated to writing and editing documents  There were many dedicated word processing machines at the time  but IBM s main competition was Wang Laboratories  Such machines were expensive and were generally accessed through terminals connected to central mainframe or midrange computers   When IBM announced it was bringing DisplayWrite to the PC  MicroPro focused on creating a clone of it which they marketed  in 1984  as  WordStar 2000   WordStar 2000 was brought up to date and now supported features such as disk directories  but lacked compatibility with the file formats of existing WordStar versions and also made numerous unpopular changes to the interface  Gradually competitors such as WordPerfect began to chip away at MicroPro s market share  MultiMate  in particular  used the same key sequences as the popular Wang line of dedicated word processors  which made it popular with secretaries switching from those to PCs   BYTE stated that WordStar 2000 had  all the charm of an elephant on motorized skates   warning in 1986 that an IBM PC AT with hard drive was highly advisable to run the software  which it described as  clumsy  overdesigned  and uninviting     I can t come up with a reason why I d want to use it   WordStar 2000 had a user interface that was substantially different from the original WordStar  and the company did little to advertise this  However  it had a lasting impact on the word processing industry by introducing keyboard shortcuts that are still widely used  namely Ctrl B for Bold  Ctrl I for Italic  and Ctrl U for Underline   1 5  Newstar  MicroPro developed a poor reputation among customers  PC Magazine wrote in 1983 that the company s  motto often seems to be   Ask Your Dealer    and in 1985 that  By late 1984 the company admitted  according to the magazine  that WordStar s reputation for power was fading  Several MicroPro employees meanwhile formed rival company Newstar  In September 1983 it published WordStar clone NewWord  which offered several features the original lacked  such as a built in spell checker and support for laser printers  Advertisements stated that  Anyone with WordStar experience won t even have to read NewWord s manuals  WordStar text files work with NewWord   Despite competition from NewStar  Microsoft Word  WordPerfect  and dozens of other companies舒which typically released new versions of their software every 12 to 18 months舒MicroPro did not release new versions of WordStar beyond 3 3 during 1984 and 1985  in part because Rubinstein relinquished control of the company after a January 1984 heart attack  His replacements canceled the promising office suite Starburst  purchased a WordStar clone  and used it as the basis of WordStar 2000  released in December 1984  It received poor reviews—by April 1985 PC Magazine referred to WordStar 2000 as  beleaguered —due to not being compatible with WordStar files and other disadvantages  and by selling at the same $495 price as WordStar 3 3 confused customers  Company employees were divided between WordStar and WordStar 2000 factions  and fiscal year 1985 sales declined to $40 million   By 1984 NewWord had released a second version  and many WordStar users switched to it  A third version appeared in 1986  In February 1985 MicroPro promised updates to WordStar 3 3  but none appeared until new management purchased NewWord and used it as the basis of WordStar 4 0 in 1987  four years after the previous version  Word  four versions from 1983 to 1987  and WordPerfect  five versions   however  had become the market leaders  More conflict between MicroPro s two factions delayed WordStar 5 0 until late 1988  again hurting the program s sales  After renaming itself after its flagship product in 1989  WordStar International merged with SoftKey in 1993   1 6  WordStar for Windows  Like many other producers of successful DOS applications  WordStar International delayed before deciding to make a version for the commercially successful Windows 3 0  The company purchased Legacy  an existing Windows based word processor  which was altered and released as WordStar for Windows in 1991  It was a well reviewed product and included many features normally only found in more expensive desktop publishing packages  However  its delayed launch meant that Microsoft Word had already firmly established itself as the corporate standard during the two previous years   1 7  Abandonment  WordStar is no longer developed  maintained or sold by its owners  It is currently the property of Riverdeep  Inc  There was some uncertainty as to whether Gores Technology Group or Riverdeep now owns WordStar  but the consensus is that it is Riverdeep  an education and consumer software company which is now part of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Learning Technology   The WordStar Users Group Mailing List was a discussion forum and source of technical support for people who continued to use WordStar long after it had ceased to be widely used  The list had several hundred members  it was started in May 1996 and finally expired in 2009   WordStar was the program of choice for conservative intellectual William F  Buckley  Jr   who used the software to write many works  including his last book  This was noted by his son  Christopher Buckley  who wrote of the almost comical loyalty and affection his father had shown for WordStar  which he had installed into every new computer he purchased despite the technical difficulty of such an endeavor as the program became increasingly outdated and incompatible with newer computers  He said of WordStar   I m told there are better programs  but I m also told there are better alphabets   Canadian science fiction author Robert J  Sawyer continues to use a customized version of WordStar for DOS to write his novels  as does George R  R  Martin   2  Interface  Because it was designed for text only display devices with only a single  functional typeface  the primary focus was on the text  without direct onscreen WYSIWYG formatting  which hardware at the time did not support  Because typesetting and layout were secondary or tertiary functions left for after the document was written  edited  and proofread  the writer did not have the many formatting possibilities offered by later word processors   As initially installed  in text mode versions of WordStar  approximately the top 1 3 of the screen was a menu of commands  with the very top line being a display of the position within the file and the user s text occupying the lower 2 3 of the screen  A user configurable option to set the help level released this space for user text  The help system could be configured to display help a short time after the first key of a command sequence was entered  As users became more familiar with the command sequences  the help system could be set to provide less and less assistance until finally all on screen menus and status information was turned off   The original computer terminals and microcomputers for which WordStar was developed  many running the CP M operating system  did not have function keys or cursor control keys  arrow keys  Page Up Down   WordStar used sequences of alphabetic keys combined with the  Control  key  which on keyboards of the time was conveniently next to the letter A  For touch typists  in addition  reaching the function and cursor keys generally requires them to take their fingers off the  home keys  with consequent loss of typing rhythm   For example  the  diamond  of Ctrl S E D X  s left  e up  d right  x down  moved the cursors one character or line to the left  up  right  or down  Ctrl A F  to the outside of the  diamond   moved the cursor a full word left right  and Ctrl R C  just  past  the Ctrl keys for up and down  scrolled a full page up down  Prefacing these keystrokes with Ctrl Q generally expanded their action  moving the cursor to the end beginning of the line  end beginning of the document  etc  Ctrl H would backspace and delete  Commands to enable bold or italics  printing  blocking text to copy or delete  saving or retrieving files from disk  etc  were typically a short sequence of keystrokes  such as Ctrl P B for bold  or Ctrl K S to save a file  Formatting codes would appear on screen  such as ^B for bold  ^Y for italics  and ^S for underscoring   Although many of these keystroke sequences were far from self evident  they tended to lend themselves to mnemonic devices  e g   Ctrl Print Bold  Ctrl blocK Save   and regular users quickly learned them through muscle memory  enabling them to rapidly navigate documents by touch  rather than memorizing  Ctrl S   cursor left    WordStar had relative weaknesses  such as an inability to reformat line justification as text was typed or deleted  Thus paragraphs had to be manually reformatted after edits and changes  But a command could be given to reformat the entire document after it had been edited or re written   Many of these weaknesses were corrected with a new interface in WordStar 2000  Reformatting of paragraphs became automatic  Most of the mnemonics were made simpler so that ^RW would Remove a Word  ^RR would Remove the Right side of a line  right of the cursor   ^RS would Remove a Sentence  and so on  WordStar 2000 was also rare among word processing programs in that it permitted the user to mark  highlight  a block of text  with ^BB for Block Begin and ^BE for Block End  and leave it marked in place  and then go to a different section and copy it  with ^BC for Block Copy   Many users found it much easier to manipulate blocks with the block commands rather than the Microsoft Word system of highlighting with a mouse  The main problem with these improvements was that users of legacy WordStar  non WordStar 2000  were quite happy with that interface and did not want to change to a new one   The WordStar interface left a large legacy  WordPerfect  available for MS DOS  made better use of the Function and Alt keys  It also includes modern cross platform word processing software like TextMaker and many text editors running under MS DOS  Linux  and other UNIX variants  which can emulate the WordStar keyboard commands using Ctrl key combinations  The popular Turbo Pascal compiler used WordStar keyboard commands in its IDE editor  Modern word processing software like Write&Set not only use the WordStar interface  but have been based on WordStar DOS file formats  allowing WordStar users who no longer have a copy of the application to easily open and edit their files  There are WordStar keyboard command emulators and keymappings  both freeware and shareware  for current versions of Microsoft Word  Popular modern word processing software like WordPerfect  StarOffice  and Microsoft Word  with the proper filters  can open and save to WordStar documents  enabling users to move back and forth   3  Features  MailMerge was an add on program  becoming integrated from WordStar 4 onwards  which facilitated the merge printing of bulk mailings  such as business letters to clients  Two files were required   a data file  being a list of recipients stored in a non document  comma delimited plain ASCII text file  typically named Clients dat  although WordStar had no requirement for a specific file extension   Each subsequent line of text in the file would be dedicated to a particular client  with name and address details separated on the line dedicated to a client by commas  read left to right  For example  Mr   Michael  Smith  7 Oakland Drive       a master document containing the text of the letter  using standard paragraphs  a k a  boilerplate text  as required  These would be mixed and matched as needed  and where appropriate  paragraphs could be inserted through external reference to subordinate documents  The writer would insert placeholders delimited by ampersands into the master document  e g   &TITLE&  &INITIAL&  &SURNAME&  &ADDRESS1&  In each copy of the letter the placeholders would be replaced with strings read from the DAT file  Mass mailings could thereby be prepared with each letter copy individually addressed   Other add on programs included SpellStar  a spell checker program  later incorporated as a direct part of the WordStar program  and DataStar  a program whose purpose was specifically to expedite creating of the data files used for merge printing  These were revolutionary features for personal computer users during the early to mid 1980s  A companion spreadsheet  CalcStar  was also produced using a somewhat WordStar like interface  collectively  WordStar  word processing   DataStar ReportStar  database management  a k a  InfoStar   and CalcStar  spreadsheet  composed the first ever office suite of personal computer programs  As a product enhancement  in the late 1980s WordStar 5 came bundled with PC Outline  a popular DOS outliner then available from Brown Bag Software  Inc  in California  PC Outline text had to be exported to a WordStar format file  as the programs were not developed to be internally compatible   WordStar identified files as either  document  or  nondocument   which led to some confusion among users   Document  referred to WordStar word processing files containing embedded word processing and formatting commands   Nondocument  files were pure ASCII text files containing no embedded formatting commands  Using WordStar in  Nondocument Mode  was essentially the same as using a traditional text editor  WordStar 5 introduced a document mode  print preview  feature  allowing the user to inspect a WYSIWYG version of text  complete with inserted graphics  as it would appear on the printed page   4  Installation  Installation of early versions of WordStar  especially for CP M  was very different from the approach of modern programs  While later editions had more or less comprehensive installation programs that allowed selection of printers and terminals from a menu  in the very early releases  each of the escape sequences required for the terminal and printer had to be identified in the hardware documentation  then hand entered  in hex  into reserved locations in the program memory image  This was a fairly typical limitation of all CP M programs of the time  since there was no mechanism to hide the complexities of the underlying hardware from the application program  To use the program with a different printer required re installation of the program  Occasionally short machine language programs had to be entered in a patch area in WordStar  to provide particular screen effects or cope with particular printers  Researching  testing  and proving out such installations was a time consuming and knowledge intensive process  making WordStar installation and customization a staple discussion of CP M users  groups during that time   DOS versions of WordStar at least had standardized the screen display  but still had to be customized for different printers   5  Running WordStar in modern platforms  WordStar version 3 x used the MS DOS File control block  FCB  interface  an early data structure for file input output which was based closely on CP M s file input output functions  The provision of the FCB interface was intended to simplify the porting of  assembly language  programs from CP M to  the then new  MS DOS  When MS DOS adopted the Unix like file interface of file handles  FCBs became a legacy interface supported for backward compatibility  Because FCB compatibility has not been maintained  WordStar 3 x will not function properly on modern versions of Windows  In particular  WordStar 3 x cannot save files  One work around is to use the DOSEMU emulator on Linux  which correctly implements the FCB interface   The DOSBox emulator does not  even on Linux   WordStar 4 0 does not have this problem because it uses the newer MS DOS interface for input output   OS 2 can run WordStar in a DOS session    In October 2014  WordStar support was added to vDos  a derivative of DOSBox but optimized for business applications  vDos allows WordStar 4 0 and above to run under 32  and 64 bit versions of Microsoft Windows from XP through 8 1  6  WordStar emulation  Although no current version of WordStar is available for modern operating systems  some former WordStar users still prefer WordStar s interface  especially the cursor diamond commands described earlier in this article  These users claim less hand movement is necessary to issue commands  and hence that writing under this interface is more efficient  The user accesses the nearby Ctrl key and then a letter or combination of letters  thus keeping his hands on or close to the typing home row instead of moving them away from it to reach for a specialty key or a mouse   To accommodate these users  WordStar emulation programs were created  One such program is by Yoji Hagiya  which remaps the standard PC keyboard  making many WordStar commands available in most Windows programs  CtrlPlus switches the Control and Caps Lock keys so that the Ctrl key is back where it originally was on older keyboards  next to the A key  It also gives functionality to the chief cursor diamond commands mentioned in this article   Another WordStar emulation utility is   also known as  WordStar for Word   by Mike Petrie  Designed to work in conjunction with CtrlPlus  the Command Emulator adds many more WordStar commands to MS Word than CtrlPlus by itself  and also changes Word 97 XP s menus to be more like those of WordStar 7 0 for DOS  the last DOS version of WordStar  For example  Ctrl+K  was WordStar s word count command and Ctrl+QL was its spell check command  Hitting these commands in the WordStar Emulator within Word runs Word s equivalent commands  WordStar for Word also adds WordStar s block commands  namely Ctrl+KB to mark the beginning of a block  Ctrl+KK to mark the end  and Ctrl+KV to move it  Alternatively  Ctrl+KC could be used to copy the block  WordStar for Word works on all versions of Word from Word 97 through 2010   The WordStar Command Emulator is written in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications  a macro programming language based on Visual Basic built into Microsoft Word to allow for a high level of customization  Most Word add ins are written in this language also known as VBA   Emacs comes with a library that provides WordStar emulation  A macro set for vi that provides WordStar emulation is available   The cross platform JOE editor is a very WordStar like alternative  When invoked as jstar Joe emulates many WordStar keybindings  JOE lacks formatting options and essentially only operates in nondocument mode  but formatted documents can be authored in HTML CSS  Markdown or another markup language   7  WordStar goes bi directional  Around 1978 Elbit Systems in Israel developed a CP M capable microcomputer named the DS2100  CP M machines were readily available and Elbit needed something to differentiate their product from others  An agreement was made with MicroPro to develop a version of WordStar that supported both English and Hebrew input  The concept was revolutionary  as Hebrew is written right to left and all word processors of the time assumed left to right  WordStar  as developed by Elbit  was the first word processor that offered bi directional input and mixed alphabets   Elbit acquired rights to the source code and a development team in Elbit  Haifa  worked on the project  For several years Hebrew English WordStar was the de facto WYSIWYG word processor leader until  inevitably  it was ousted by younger competitors   8  Filename extensions  DOS WordStar files by default have no extension  some users adopted their own conventions  such as the letters WS followed by the version number  for example  WS3   or just plain WS  Backup files were automatically saved as BAKs   WordStar for Windows files use the extension WSD  WordStar for Windows templates use the extension WST  WordStar for Windows macros use the extension WMC  WordStar for Windows temporary files use the extension  WS  WordStar 2000 for DOS and UNIX PC do not have a fixed extension but DOC and WS2 were common Note   There is no WordStar 2000 for Windows   9  Clones  Newstar produced New Word for Amstrad PCW8256  PCW8512 in mid 1980s  running CP M on 3 inch floppy disks  NewWord also was available for MS DOS and in a native version for Concurrent CP M  It was very similar to WordStar   As of 2013 a WordStar clone was in the process of being developed  under the name of WordTsar  In addition German software author Martin Vieregg has sold the Write&Set package  a shareware GUI based WordStar clone for Microsoft Windows and OS 2   eComStation since the latter half of the 90 s  and more recently for Linux and OS X as well   10  See also  List of word processors  11  References  12  External links  — featuring a full  as far as is known  history of WordStar  — Microsoft s Office
