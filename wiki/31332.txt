The International Obfuscated C Code Contest  abbreviated IOCCC  is a computer programming contest for the most creatively obfuscated C code  Held annually between 1984 and 1996  and thereafter in 1998  2000  2001  2004  2005  2006  2011  2012  and 2013 it is described as  celebrating  C s  syntactical opaqueness   The winning code for the 22nd contest  held in 2013  was released in January 2014   Prior to 2004  entries were submitted by email  In 2004  for the 17th IOCCC  the competition switched to using a web based submission process   Entries are evaluated anonymously by a panel of judges  The judging process is documented in the competition guidelines and consists of elimination rounds  By tradition  no information is given about the total number of entries for each competition  Winning entries are awarded with a category  such as  Worst Abuse of the C preprocessor  or  Most Erratic Behavior   and then announced on the official IOCCC website  Entries that do not make it are deleted and forgotten  the contest states that being announced on the IOCCC website is the award for winning   1  History  The IOCCC was started by Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel in 1984 while employed at National Semiconductor s Genix porting group  The idea for the contest came after they compared notes with each other about some poorly written code that they had to fix  notably the Bourne shell  which used macros to emulate ALGOL 68 syntax  and buggy version of finger for BSD  The contest itself was the topic of a quiz question in the 1993 Computer Bowl  After a hiatus of five years starting in 2006  the contest returned in 2011   Compared with other programming contests  the IOCCC is described as  not all that serious  by Michael Swaine  editor of Dr  Dobbs   2  Rules  Each year  the rules of the contest are published on the IOCCC website  Rules vary from year to year and are posted with a set of guidelines that attempt to convey the spirit of the rules   The rules are often deliberately written with subtle loopholes that contestants are somewhat encouraged to find and abuse  This is the result of the contest being a  parody of the software development process   Entries that take advantage of some loophole in the rules  whether or not they pass a final round of judging  can cause the rules for the following year s contest to be adjusted accordingly  although often other subtle loopholes are deliberately introduced in the process    3  Obfuscations employed  Due to the nature of the contest  entries often employ strange or unusual tricks  such as using the C preprocessor to do things it was not designed to do  or avoiding commonly used constructs in the C programming language in favor of much more obscure ways of achieving the same thing  Two contest winners generated a list of prime numbers using the C preprocessor  spectacularly   according to Dr  Dobbs  Some quotes from 2004 winners include   Some ways in which contributions are notable include   The appearance of the source code  formatted to resemble images  text  etc   after the manner of ASCII art   Preprocessor redefinitions to make code harder to read   Self modifying code   Worst abuse of the rules  In several years  an entry was submitted that was so patently absurd that it required a new definition of some of the rules for the next year  This is regarded as a high honor  An example is the world s shortest self reproducing program  The entry was a program designed to output its own source code  and which had zero bytes of source code  When the program ran  it printed all zero bytes of the entire program s source code  meaning it prints nothing   In the effort to take obfuscation to its extremes  contestants have produced programs which skirt around the edges of C standards  or result in constructs which trigger rarely used code path combinations in compilers  As a result  several of the past entries may not compile directly in a modern compiler  and some may even cause crashes   4  Examples  Within the code size limit of only a few kilobytes  contestants have managed to do impressively complicated things â€“ a 2004 winner turned out an operating system   Below is a 1988 entry which calculates pi by looking at its own area   define    F 00    F OO    int F 00 OO 00 main   F OO   printf  %1 3f\n  4 * F OO OO   F OO                                                                                                                                           This entry was written in K&R C  it does not work correctly in ANSI C without some change    Another example is the following flight simulator  the winner of the 1998 IOCCC  as listed and described in Calculated Bets  Computers  Gambling  and Mathematical Modeling to Win  2001  and shown below
