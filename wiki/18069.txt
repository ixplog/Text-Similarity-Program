A lubricant is a substance introduced to reduce friction between surfaces in mutual contact  which ultimately reduces the heat generated when the surfaces move  It may also have the function of transmitting forces  transporting foreign particles  or heating or cooling the surfaces  The property of reducing friction is known as lubricity   In addition to industrial applications  lubricants are used for many other purposes  Other uses include cooking  oils and fats in use in frying pans  in baking to prevent food sticking   bio medical applications on humans  e g  lubricants for artificial joints   ultrasound examination  medical examinations  and the use of personal lubricant for sexual purposes   1  Properties  A good lubricant generally possesses the following characteristics   high boiling point and low freezing point  in order to stay liquid within a wide range of temperature   high viscosity index  thermal stability  hydraulic stability  demulsibility  corrosion prevention  high resistance to oxidation   1 1  Formulation  Typically lubricants contain 90% base oil  most often petroleum fractions  called mineral oils  and less than 10% additives  Vegetable oils or synthetic liquids such as hydrogenated polyolefins  esters  silicones  fluorocarbons and many others are sometimes used as base oils  Additives deliver reduced friction and wear  increased viscosity  improved viscosity index  resistance to corrosion and oxidation  aging or contamination  etc   Non liquid lubricants include grease  powders  dry graphite  PTFE  molybdenum disulfide  tungsten disulfide  etc    PTFE tape used in plumbing  air cushion and others  Dry lubricants such as graphite  molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide also offer lubrication at temperatures  up to 350 °C  higher than liquid and oil based lubricants are able to operate  Limited interest has been shown in low friction properties of compacted oxide glaze layers formed at several hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems  however  practical use is still many years away due to their physically unstable nature   1 2  Additives  A large number of additives are used to impart performance characteristics to the lubricants  The main families of additives are   Antioxidants  Detergents  Anti wear  Metal deactivators  Corrosion inhibitors  Rust inhibitors  Friction modifiers  Extreme Pressure  Anti foaming agents  Viscosity index improvers  Demulsifying Emulsifying  Stickiness improver  provide adhesive property towards tool surface  in metalworking   Complexing agent  in case of greases  Note that many of the basic chemical compounds used as detergents  example  calcium sulfonate  serve the purpose of the first seven items in the list as well  Usually it is not economically or technically feasible to use a single do it all additive compound  Oils for hypoid gear lubrication will contain high content of EP additives  Grease lubricants may contain large amount of solid particle friction modifiers  such as graphite  molybdenum sulfide   2  Types of lubricants  In 1999  an estimated 37 300 000 tons of lubricants were consumed worldwide  Automotive applications dominate  but other industrial  marine  and metal working applications are also big consumers of lubricants  Although air and other gas based lubricants are known  e g   in fluid bearings   liquid and solid lubricants dominate the market  especially the former   Lubricants are generally composed of a majority of base oil plus a variety of additives to impart desirable characteristics  Although generally lubricants are based on one type of base oil  mixtures of the base oils also are used to meet performance requirements   2 1  Base oil groups  Mineral oil term is used to encompass lubricating base oil derived from crude oil  The American Petroleum Institute  API  designates several types of lubricant base oil   Group I – Saturates   90% and or sulfur   0 03%  and Society of Automotive Engineers  SAE  viscosity index  VI  of 80 to 120  Group II – Saturates   90% and sulfur   0 03%  and SAE viscosity index of 80 to 120  Group III – Saturates   90%  sulfur   0 03%  and SAE viscosity index over 120  Group IV – Polyalphaolefins  PAO   Group V – All others not included above such as naphthenics  PAG  esters  The lubricant industry commonly extends this group terminology to include   Group I+ with a Viscosity Index of 103–108  Group II+ with a Viscosity Index of 113–119  Group III+ with a Viscosity Index of at least 140 Can also be classified into three categories depending on the prevailing compositions   Paraffinic  Naphthenic  Aromatic  2 2  Biolubricants made from vegetable oils and other renewable sources  These are primarily triglyceride esters derived from plants and animals  For lubricant base oil use the vegetable derived materials are preferred  Common ones include high oleic canola oil  castor oil  palm oil  sunflower seed oil and rapeseed oil from vegetable  and Tall oil from tree sources  Many vegetable oils are often hydrolyzed to yield the acids which are subsequently combined selectively to form specialist synthetic esters  Other naturally derived lubricants include lanolin  wool grease  a natural water repellent    Whale oil was a historically important lubricant  with some uses up to the latter part of the 20th century as a friction modifier additive for automatic transmission fluid   In 2008  the biolubricant market was around 1% of UK lubricant sales in a total lubricant market of 840 000 tonnes year   Lanolin is a natural water repellent  derived from sheep wool grease  and is an alternative to the more common petro chemical based lubricants  This lubricant is also a corrosion inhibitor  protecting against rust  salts  and acids   Water can also be used on its own  or as a major component in combination with one of the other base oils  Commonly used in engineering processes  such as milling and lathe turning   2 3  Synthetic oils  Polyalpha olefin  PAO   Synthetic esters  Polyalkylene glycols  PAG   Phosphate esters  Alkylated naphthalenes  AN   Silicate esters  Ionic fluids  2 4  Solid lubricants  PTFE  polytetrafluoroethylene  PTFE  is typically used as a coating layer on  for example  cooking utensils to provide a non stick surface  Its usable temperature range up to 350 °C and chemical inertness make it a useful additive in special greases  Under extreme pressures  PTFE powder or solids is of little value as it is soft and flows away from the area of contact  Ceramic or metal or alloy lubricants must be used then   Teflon®  is a brand of PTFE owned by DuPont Co   Inorganic solids  Graphite  hexagonal boron nitride  molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are examples of materials that can be used as solid lubricants  often to very high temperature  The use of some such materials is sometimes restricted by their poor resistance to oxidation  e g   molybdenum disulfide can only be used up to 350°C in air  but 1100°C in reducing environments    Metal alloy  Metal alloys  composites and pure metals can be used as grease additives or the sole constituents of sliding surfaces and bearings  Cadmium and Gold are used for plating surfaces which gives them good corrosion resistance and sliding properties  Lead  Tin  Zinc alloys and various Bronze alloys are used as sliding bearings  or their powder can be used to lubricate sliding surfaces alone  or as additives to  2 5  Aqueous lubrication  Aqueous lubrication is of interest in a number of technological applications  Strongly hydrated brush polymers such as PEG can act as lubricants at liquid solid interfaces  By continuous rapid exchange of bound water with other free water molecules  these polymer films keep the surfaces separated while maintaining a high ﬂuidity at the brush–brush interface at high compressions  thus leading to a very low coefﬁcient of friction   3  Applications  Lubricants perform the following key functions   Keep moving parts apart  Reduce friction  Transfer heat  Carry away contaminants & debris  Transmit power  Protect against wear  Prevent corrosion  Seal for gases  Stop the risk of smoke and fire of objects  Prevent rust  One of the single largest applications for lubricants  in the form of motor oil  is protecting the internal combustion engines in motor vehicles and powered equipment   Lubricants such as 2 cycle oil are added to fuels like gasoline which has low lubricity  Sulfur impurities in fuels also provide some lubrication properties  which has to be taken in account when switching to a low sulfur diesel  biodiesel is a popular diesel fuel additive providing additional lubricity   Another approach to reducing friction and wear is to use bearings such as ball bearings  roller bearings or air bearings  which in turn require internal lubrication themselves  or to use sound  in the case of acoustic lubrication   3 1  Keep moving parts apart  Lubricants are typically used to separate moving parts in a system  This has the benefit of reducing friction and surface fatigue  together with reduced heat generation  operating noise and vibrations  Lubricants achieve this in several ways  The most common is by forming a physical barrier i e   a thin layer of lubricant separates the moving parts  This is analogous to hydroplaning  the loss of friction observed when a car tire is separated from the road surface by moving through standing water  This is termed hydrodynamic lubrication  In cases of high surface pressures or temperatures  the fluid film is much thinner and some of the forces are transmitted between the surfaces through the lubricant   3 2  Reduce friction  Typically the lubricant to surface friction is much less than surface to surface friction in a system without any lubrication  Thus use of a lubricant reduces the overall system friction  Reduced friction has the benefit of reducing heat generation and reduced formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency  Lubricants may contain additives known as friction modifiers that chemically bind to metal surfaces to reduce surface friction even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant present for hydrodynamic lubrication  e g  protecting the valve train in a car engine at startup   3 3  Transfer heat  Both gas and liquid lubricants can transfer heat  However  liquid lubricants are much more effective on account of their high specific heat capacity  Typically the liquid lubricant is constantly circulated to and from a cooler part of the system  although lubricants may be used to warm as well as to cool when a regulated temperature is required  This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that is carried away in any given unit of time  High flow systems can carry away a lot of heat and have the additional benefit of reducing the thermal stress on the lubricant  Thus lower cost liquid lubricants may be used  The primary drawback is that high flows typically require larger sumps and bigger cooling units  A secondary drawback is that a high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure during sudden system shut downs  An automotive oil cooled turbocharger is a typical example  Turbochargers get red hot during operation and the oil that is cooling them only survives as its residence time in the system is very short i e  high flow rate  If the system is shut down suddenly  pulling into a service area after a high speed drive and stopping the engine  the oil that is in the turbo charger immediately oxidizes and will clog the oil ways with deposits  Over time these deposits can completely block the oil ways  reducing the cooling with the result that the turbo charger experiences total failure typically with seized bearings  Non flowing lubricants such as greases & pastes are not effective at heat transfer although they do contribute by reducing the generation of heat in the first place   3 4  Carry away contaminants and debris  Lubricant circulation systems have the benefit of carrying away internally generated debris and external contaminants that get introduced into the system to a filter where they can be removed  Lubricants for machines that regularly generate debris or contaminants such as automotive engines typically contain detergent and dispersant additives to assist in debris and contaminant transport to the filter and removal  Over time the filter will get clogged and require cleaning or replacement  hence the recommendation to change a car s oil filter at the same time as changing the oil  In closed systems such as gear boxes the filter may be supplemented by a magnet to attract any iron fines that get created   It is apparent that in a circulatory system the oil will only be as clean as the filter can make it  thus it is unfortunate that there are no industry standards by which consumers can readily assess the filtering ability of various automotive filters  Poor filtration significantly reduces the life of the machine  engine  as well as making the system inefficient   3 5  Transmit power  Lubricants known as hydraulic fluid are used as the working fluid in hydrostatic power transmission  Hydraulic fluids comprise a large portion of all lubricants produced in the world  The automatic transmission s torque converter is another important application for power transmission with lubricants   3 6  Protect against wear  Lubricants prevent wear by keeping the moving parts apart  Lubricants may also contain anti wear or extreme pressure additives to boost their performance against wear and fatigue   3 7  Prevent corrosion  Good quality lubricants are typically formulated with additives that form chemical bonds with surfaces  or exclude moisture  to prevent corrosion and rust   3 8  Seal for gases  Lubricants will occupy the clearance between moving parts through the capillary force  thus sealing the clearance  This effect can be used to seal pistons and shafts   3 9  Application by fluid types

 Piston engine oils  Marine  Crosshead cylinder oils  Crosshead Crankcase oils  Trunk piston engine oils  Stern tube lubricants  Horological  4  Other relevant phenomena  4 1   Glaze  formation  high temperature wear   A further phenomenon that has undergone investigation in relation to high temperature wear prevention and lubrication  is that of a compacted oxide layer glaze formation  This is the generation of a compacted oxide layer which sinters together to form a crystalline  glaze   not the amorphous layer seen in pottery  generally at high temperatures  from metallic surfaces sliding against each other  or a metallic surface against a ceramic surface   Due to the elimination of metallic contact and adhesion by the generation of oxide  friction and wear is reduced  Effectively  such a surface is self lubricating   As the  glaze  is already an oxide  it can survive to very high temperatures in air or oxidising environments  However  it is disadvantaged by it being necessary for the base metal  or ceramic  having to undergo some wear first to generate sufficient oxide debris   5  Marketing  The global lubricant market is generally competitive with numerous manufacturers and marketers  Overall the western market may be considered mature with a flat to declining overall volumes while there is strong growth in the emerging economies  The lubricant marketers generally pursue one or more of the following strategies when pursuing business   Specification  The lubricant is said to meet a certain specification  In the consumer market  this is often supported by a logo  symbol or words that inform the consumer that the lubricant marketer has obtained independent verification of conformance to the specification  Examples of these include the API’s donut logo or the NSF tick mark  The most widely perceived is SAE viscosity specification  like SAE 10W 40  Lubricity specifications are institute and manufacturer based  In the U S  institute  API S for petrol engines  API C for diesel engines  For 2007 the current specs are API SM and API CJ 4  Higher second letter marks better oil properties  like lower engine wear supported by tests  In EU the ACEA specifications are used  There are classes A  B  C  E with number following the letter  Japan introduced the JASO specification for motorbike engines  In the industrial market place the specification may take the form of a legal contract to supply a conforming fluid or purchasers may choose to buy on the basis of a manufacturers own published specification   Original equipment manufacturer  OEM  approval  Specifications often denote a minimum acceptable performance levels  Thus many equipment manufacturers add on their own particular requirements or tighten the tolerance on a general specification to meet their particular needs  or doing a different set of tests or using different own testbed engine   This gives the lubricant marketer an avenue to differentiate their product by designing it to meet an OEM specification  Often  the OEM carries out extensive testing and maintains an active list of approved products  This is a powerful marketing tool in the lubricant marketplace  Text on the back of the motor oil label usually has a list of conformity to some OEM specifications  such as MB  MAN  Volvo  Cummins  VW  BMW or others  Manufactures may have vastly different specifications for the range of engines they make  one may not be completely suitable for some other   Performance  The lubricant marketer claims benefits for the customer based on the superior performance of the lubricant  Such marketing is supported by glamorous advertising  sponsorships of typically sporting events and endorsements  Unfortunately broad performance claims are common in the consumer marketplace  which are difficult or impossible for a typical consumer to verify  In the B2B market place the marketer is normally expected to show data that supports the claims  hence reducing the use of broad claims  Increasing performance  reducing wear and fuel consumption is also aim of the later API  ACEA and car manufacturer oil specifications  so lubricant marketers can back their claims by doing extensive  and expensive  testing   Longevity  The marketer claims that their lubricant maintains its performance over a longer period of time  For example in the consumer market  a typical motor oil change interval is around the   The lubricant marketer may offer a lubricant that lasts for or more to convince a user to pay a premium  Typically  the consumer would need to check or balance the longer life and any warranties offered by the lubricant manufacturer with the possible loss of equipment manufacturer warranties by not following its schedule  Many car and engine manufacturers support extended drain intervals  but request extended drain interval certified oil used in that case  and sometimes a special oil filter  Example  In older Mercedes Benz engines and in truck engines one can use engine oil MB 228 1 for basic drain interval  Engine oils conforming with higher specification MB 228 3 may be used twice as long  oil of MB 228 5 specification 3x longer  Note that the oil drain interval is valid for new engine with fuel conforming car manufacturer specification  When using lower grade fuel  or worn engine the oil change interval has to shorten accordingly  In general oils approved for extended use are of higher specification and reduce wear  In the industrial market place the longevity is generally measured in time units and the lubricant marketer can suffer large financial penalties if their claims are not substantiated   Efficiency  The lubricant marketer claims improved equipment efficiency when compared to rival products or technologies  the claim is usually valid when comparing lubricant of higher specification with previous grade  Typically the efficiency is proved by showing a reduction in energy costs to operate the system  Guaranteeing improved efficiency is the goal of some oil test specifications such as API CI 4 Plus for diesel engines  Some car engine manufacturers also specifically request certain higher efficiency level for lubricants for extended drain intervals   Operational tolerance  The lubricant is claimed to cope with specific operational environment needs  Some common environments include dry  wet  cold  hot  fire risk  high load  high or low speed  chemical compatibility  atmospheric compatibility  pressure or vacuum and various combinations  The usual thermal characteristics is outlined with SAE viscosity given for 100°C  like SAE 30  SAE 40  For low temperature viscosity the SAE xxW mark is used  Both markings can be combined together to form a SAE 0W 60 for example  Viscosity index  VI  marks viscosity change with temperature  with higher VI numbers being more temperature stable   Economy  The marketer offers a lubricant at a lower cost than rivals either in the same grade or a similar one that will fill the purpose for lesser price   Stationary installations with short drain intervals   Alternative may be offering a more expensive lubricant and promise return in lower wear  specific fuel consumption or longer drain intervals   Expensive machinery  un affordable downtimes    Environment friendly  The lubricant is said to be environmentally friendly  Typically this is supported by qualifying statements or conformance to generally accepted approvals  Several organizations  typically government sponsored  exist globally to qualify and approve such lubricants by evaluating their potential for environmental harm  Typically  the lubricant manufacturer is allowed to indicate such approval by showing some special mark  Examples include the German “Blue Angel”  European “Daisy” Eco label  Global Eco Label “GEN mark”  Nordic  “White Swan”  Japanese “Earth friendly mark”  USA “Green Seal”  Canadian “Environmental Choice”  Chinese “Huan”  Singapore “Green Label” and the French “NF Environment mark”   Composition  The marketer claims novel composition of the lubricant which improves some tangible performance over its rivals  Typically the technology is protected via formal patents or other intellectual property protection mechanism to prevent rivals from copying  Lot of claims in this area are simple marketing buzzwords  since most of them are related to a manufacturer specific process naming  which achieves similar results than other ones  but the competition is prohibited from using a trademark   Quality  The marketer claims broad superior quality of its lubricant with no factual evidence  The quality is  proven  by references to famous brand  sporting figure  racing team  some professional endorsement or some similar subjective claim  All motor oil labels wear mark similar to  of outstanding quality  or  quality additives   the actual comparative evidence is always lacking   6  Disposal and environmental  It is estimated that 40% of all lubricants are released into the environment   Disposal  Recycling  burning  landfill and discharge into water may achieve disposal of used lubricant  There are typically strict regulations in most countries regarding disposal in landfill and discharge into water as even small amount of lubricant can contaminate a large amount of water  Most regulations permit a threshold level of lubricant that may be present in waste streams and companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually in treating their waste waters to get to acceptable levels   Burning the lubricant as fuel  typically to generate electricity  is also governed by regulations mainly on account of the relatively high level of additives present  Burning generates both airborne pollutants and ash rich in toxic materials  mainly heavy metal compounds  Thus lubricant burning takes place in specialized facilities that have incorporated special scrubbers to remove airborne pollutants and have access to landfill sites with permits to handle the toxic ash   Unfortunately  most lubricant that ends up directly in the environment is due to general public discharging it onto the ground  into drains and directly into landfills as trash  Other direct contamination sources include runoff from roadways  accidental spillages  natural or man made disasters and pipeline leakages   Improvement in filtration technologies and processes has now made recycling a viable option  with rising price of base stock and crude oil   Typically various filtration systems remove particulates  additives and oxidation products and recover the base oil  The oil may get refined during the process  This base oil is then treated much the same as virgin base oil however there is considerable reluctance to use recycled oils as they are generally considered inferior  Basestock fractionally vacuum distilled from used lubricants has superior properties to all natural oils  but cost effectiveness depends on many factors  Used lubricant may also be used as refinery feedstock to become part of crude oil  Again there is considerable reluctance to this use as the additives  soot and wear metals will seriously poison deactivate the critical catalysts in the process  Cost prohibits carrying out both filtration  soot  additives removal  and re refining  distilling  isomerisation  hydrocrack  etc   however the primary hindrance to recycling still remains the collection of fluids as refineries need continuous supply in amounts measured in cisterns  rail tanks   Occasionally  unused lubricant requires disposal  The best course of action in such situations is to return it to the manufacturer where it can be processed as a part of fresh batches   Environment  Lubricants both fresh and used can cause considerable damage to the environment mainly due to their high potential of serious water pollution  Further the additives typically contained in lubricant can be toxic to flora and fauna  In used fluids the oxidation products can be toxic as well  Lubricant persistence in the environment largely depends upon the base fluid  however if very toxic additives are used they may negatively affect the persistence  Lanolin lubricants are non toxic making them the environmental alternative which is safe for both users and the environment   7  Societies and industry bodies
