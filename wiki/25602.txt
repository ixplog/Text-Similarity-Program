Radium is a chemical element with symbol Ra and atomic number 88  It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table  also known as the alkaline earth metals  The color of pure radium is almost pure white  but it readily oxidizes on exposure to air  becoming black in color  All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive  with the most stable isotope being radium 226  which has a half life of 1600 years and decays into radon gas  When radium decays  ionizing radiation is a product  which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence   Radium  in the form of radium chloride  was discovered by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie in 1898  They extracted the radium compound from uraninite and published the discovery at the French Academy of Sciences five days later  Radium was isolated in its metallic state by Marie Curie and André Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of radium chloride in 1910   In nature  radium is found in uranium and thorium ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite  Radium is not necessary for living organisms  and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity  Currently  other than its use in nuclear medicine  radium has no commercial applications  formerly  it was used as a radioactive source for radioluminescent devices and also in radioactive quackery for its supposed curative powers  Today  these former applications are no longer in vogue because radium s toxicity has since become known  and less dangerous isotopes are used instead in radioluminescent devices   1  Characteristics  Radium is the heaviest known alkaline earth metal and is the only radioactive member of its group  Its properties most closely resemble its lighter congener barium  but it is not as well studied due to its dangerous radioactivity   1 1  Physical  Pure radium is a volatile silvery white metal  Its color rapidly vanishes upon oxidation in air  yielding a black layer of radium nitride  Ra3N2   Its melting point is either or   and its boiling point is   Both of these values are slightly lower than those of barium  confirming periodic trends down the group 2 elements  Like barium  radium crystallizes in the body centered cubic structure at standard temperature and pressure  the radium–radium bond distance is 514 8 picometers  Radium has a density of 5 5 g cm3  higher than that of barium  again confirming periodic trends  the radium barium density ratio is comparable to the radium barium atomic mass ratio  due to the two elements  similar crystal structures   1 2  Chemical  Radium  like barium  is a highly reactive metal and always exhibits its group oxidation state of +2  It forms the colorless Ra2+ cation in aqueous solution  which is highly basic and does not form complexes readily  Most radium compounds are therefore simple ionic compounds  though participation from the 6s and 6p electrons  in addition to the valence 7s electrons  is expected due to relativistic effects and would enhance the covalent character of radium compounds such as RaF2 and RaAt2  Solid radium compounds are white as radium ions provide no specific coloring  but they gradually turn yellow and then dark over time due to self radiolysis from radium s alpha decay  Insoluble radium compounds coprecipitate with all barium  most strontium  and most lead compounds   1 3  Isotopes  Radium has 33 known isotopes  with mass numbers from 202 to 234  all of them are radioactive  Four of these – 223Ra  half life 11 4 days   224Ra  3 64 days   226Ra  1600 years   and 228Ra  5 75 years  – occur naturally in the decay chains of primordial thorium 232  uranium 235  and uranium 238  223Ra from uranium 235  226Ra from uranium 238  and the other two from thorium 232   These isotopes nevertheless still have half lives too short to be primordial radionuclides and only exist in nature from these decay chains  Together with the artificial 225Ra  15 d   these are the five most stable isotopes of radium  All other known radium isotopes have half lives under two hours  and the majority have half lives under a minute  At least 12 nuclear isomers have been reported  the most stable of them is radium 205m  with a half life of between 130 and 230 milliseconds  which is still shorter than thirty four ground state radium isotopes   In the early history of the study of radioactivity  the different natural isotopes of radium were given different names  In this scheme  223Ra was named actinium X  AcX   224Ra thorium X  ThX   226Ra radium  Ra   and 228Ra mesothorium 1  MsTh1   When it was realized that all of these are isotopes of thorium  many of these names fell out of use  and  radium  came to refer to all isotopes  not just 226Ra  Some of radium 226 s decay products received historical names including  radium   ranging from radium A to radium G   226Ra is the most stable isotope of radium and is the last isotope in the  4n + 2  decay chain of uranium 238 with a half life of over a century  Its immediate decay product is the dense radioactive noble gas radon  which is responsible for much of the danger of environmental radium  It is 2 7 million times more radioactive than the same molar amount of natural uranium  mostly uranium 238   due to its proportionally shorter half life   A sample of radium metal maintains itself at a higher temperature than its surroundings because of the radiation it emits – alpha particles  beta particles  and gamma rays  More specifically  natural radium  which is mostly 226Ra  emits mostly alpha particles  but other steps in its decay chain  the uranium or radium series  emit alpha or beta particles  and almost all particle emissions are accompanied by gamma rays   2  History  2 1  Discovery  Radium was discovered by Marie Curie and her husband Pierre on 21 December 1898  in a uraninite sample  While studying the mineral earlier  the Curies removed uranium from it and found that the remaining material was still radioactive  They separated out an element similar to bismuth from pitchblende in July 1898  that turned out to be polonium  They then separated out a radioactive mixture consisting mostly of two components  compounds of barium  which gave a brilliant green flame color  and unknown radioactive compounds which gave carmine spectral lines that had never been documented before  The Curies found the radioactive compounds to be very similar to the barium compounds  except that they were more insoluble  This made it possible for the Curies to separate out the radioactive compounds and discover a new element in them  radium  The Curies announced their discovery to the French Academy of Sciences on 26 December 1898  The naming of radium dates to about 1899  from the French word radium  formed in Modern Latin from radius  ray   this was in recognition of radium s power of emitting energy in the form of rays   2 2  Subsequent developments  In 1910  radium was isolated as a pure metal by Curie and André Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of a pure radium chloride  RaCl2  solution using a mercury cathode  producing a radium–mercury amalgam  This amalgam was then heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas to remove the mercury  leaving pure radium metal  The same year  E  Eoler isolated radium by thermal decomposition of its azide  Ra N3 2  Radium metal was first industrially produced in the beginning of the 20th century by Biraco  a subsidiary company of Union Minière du Haut Katanga  UMHK  in its Olen plant in Belgium   The common historical unit for radioactivity  the curie  is based on the radioactivity of 226Ra   3  Occurrence  All isotopes of radium have half lives much shorter than the age of the Earth  so that any primordial radium would have decayed long ago  Radium nevertheless still occurs in the environment  as the isotopes 223Ra  224Ra  226Ra  and 228Ra are part of the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium isotopes  Of these four isotopes  the most long lived is 226Ra  half life 1600 years   a decay product of natural uranium  Because of its relative longevity  226Ra is the most common isotope of the element  Thus  radium is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore uraninite and various other uranium minerals  and in even tinier quantities in thorium minerals  One ton of pitchblende typically yields about one seventh of a gram of radium  One kilogram of the Earth s crust contains about 900 picograms of radium  and one liter of sea water contains about 89 femtograms of radium   4  Extraction  In the first extraction of radium Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende  The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulphuric acid leaving radium sulphate  which is similar to barium sulphate but even less soluble in the residues  The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulphate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulphate  The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to remove as much as possible of other compounds  The remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the barium sulphate into barium carbonate carrying the radium  thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid  After dissolution the barium and radium are reprecitated as sulphates and this was repeated one or few times  for further purification of the mixed sulphate  Some impurities  that form insoluble sulphides  were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulphide followed by filtering  When the mixed sulphate were pure enough they were once more converted to mixed chloride and barium and radium were separated by fractional crystallisation while monitoring the progress using a spectroscope  radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines   and the electroscope  A similar process was still used for industrial radium extraction in 1940  but mixed bromides were then used for the fractionation  If the barium content of the uranium ore is not high enough it is easy to add some to carry the radium  These processes were applied to high grade uranium ores but may not work well with low grade ores   5  Production  Uranium had no large scale application in the late 18th century and therefore no large uranium mines existed  In the beginning the only larger source for uranium ore was the silver mines at Joachimsthal  now Jáchymov  in the Austrian Empire  The uranium ore was only a by product of the mining activities  After the isolation of radium by Marie and Pierre Curie from uranium ore from Joachimsthal several scientists started to isolate radium in small quantities  Later small companies purchased mine tailings from Joachimsthal mines and started isolating radium  In 1904 the Austrian government took over the ownership of the mines and stopped exporting raw ore  For some time the radium availability was low   The formation of an Austrian monopoly and the strong urge of other countries to have access to radium led to a world wide search for uranium ores  The United States took over as leading producer in the early 1910s  The Carnotite sands in Colorado provide some of the element  but richer ores are found in the Congo and the area of the Great Bear Lake and the Great Slave Lake of northwestern Canada  Neither of the deposits is mined for radium but the uranium content makes mining profitable   The amounts of radium produced were and are always relatively small  for example  in 1918  13 6 g of radium were produced in the United States  In 1954  the total worldwide supply of purified radium amounted to about 5 pounds  2 3 kg   and it is still in this range today  while the annual production of pure radium compounds is only about 100 g in total today  The chief radium producing countries are Belgium  Canada  the Czech Republic  Slovakia  the United Kingdom  and the post Soviet states   6  Compounds  Radium oxide  RaO  has not been characterized  despite oxides being common compounds for the other alkaline earth metals  Radium hydroxide  Ra OH 2  is the most readily soluble among the alkaline earth hydroxides and is a stronger base than its barium congener  barium hydroxide  It is also more soluble than actinium hydroxide and thorium hydroxide  these three adjacent hydroxides may be separated by precipitating them with ammonia   Radium chloride  RaCl2  is a colorless  luminous compound  It becomes yellow after some time due to self damage by the alpha radiation given off by radium when it decays  Small amounts of barium impurities give the compound a rose color  It is soluble in water  though less so than barium chloride  and its solubility decreases with increasing concentration of hydrochloric acid  Crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaCl2·2H2O  isomorphous with its barium analog   Radium bromide  RaBr2  is also a colorless  luminous compound  In water  it is more soluble than radium chloride  Like radium chloride  crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaBr2·2H2O  isomorphous with its barium analog  The ionizing radiation emitted by radium bromide excites nitrogen molecules in the air  making it glow  The alpha particles of radium quickly gain two electrons to become neutral helium  with builds up inside and weakens radium bromide crystals  This effect sometimes causes the crystals to break or even explode   Radium nitrate  Ra NO3 2  is a white compound that can be made by dissolving radium carbonate in nitric acid  As the concentration of nitric acid increases  the solubility of radium nitrate decreases  an important property for the chemical purification of radium   Radium forms much the same insoluble salts as its lighter congener barium  it forms the insoluble sulfate  RaSO4  the most insoluble known sulfate   chromate  RaCrO4   carbonate  RaCO3   iodate  Ra IO3 2   tetrafluoroberyllate  RaBeF4   and nitrate  Ra NO3 2   With the exception of the carbonate  all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding barium salts  Additionally  radium phosphate  oxalate  and sulfite are probably also insoluble  as they coprecipitate with the corresponding insoluble barium salts  The great insolubility of radium sulfate  at 20 °C  only 2 1 mg will dissolve in 1 kg of water  means that it is one of the less biologically dangerous radium compounds   7  Applications  Some of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties  More recently discovered radioisotopes  such as cobalt 60 and caesium 137  are replacing radium in even these limited uses because several of these isotopes are more powerful emitters  safer to handle  and available in more concentrated form   7 1  Historical  7 1 1  Luminescent paint  Radium was formerly used in self luminous paints for watches  nuclear panels  aircraft switches  clocks  and instrument dials  A typical self luminous watch that uses radium paint contains around 1 microgram of radium  In the mid 1920s  a lawsuit was filed against the United States Radium Corporation by five dying  Radium Girl  dial painters who had painted radium based luminous paint on the dials of watches and clocks  The dial painters routinely licked their brushes to give them a fine point  thereby ingesting radium  Their exposure to radium caused serious health effects which included sores  anemia  and bone cancer  This is because radium is treated as calcium by the body  and deposited in the bones  where radioactivity degrades marrow and can mutate bone cells   During the litigation  it was determined that the company s scientists and management had taken considerable precautions to protect themselves from the effects of radiation  yet had not seen fit to protect their employees  Worse  for several years the companies had attempted to cover up the effects and avoid liability by insisting that the Radium Girls were instead suffering from syphilis  This complete disregard for employee welfare had a significant impact on the formulation of occupational disease labor law   As a result of the lawsuit  the adverse effects of radioactivity became widely known  and radium dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear  In particular  dial painters no longer licked paint brushes to shape them  which caused some ingestion of radium salts   Radium was still used in dials as late as the 1960s  but there were no further injuries to dial painters  This highlighted that the harm to the Radium Girls could easily have been avoided   From the 1960s the use of radium paint was discontinued  In many cases luminous dials were implemented with non radioactive fluorescent materials excited by light  such devices glow in the dark after exposure to light  but the glow fades  Where indefinite self luminosity in darkness was required  safer radioactive promethium or tritium paint was used  both continue to be used today  These had the added advantage of not degrading the phosphor over time  unlike radium  Tritium emits very low energy beta radiation  even lower energy than the beta radiation emitted by promethium  which cannot penetrate the skin  rather than the penetrating gamma radiation of radium and is regarded as safer  It has a half life of 12 years   Clocks  watches  and instruments dating from the first half of the 20th century  often in military applications  may have been painted with radioactive luminous paint  They are usually no longer luminous  however  this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium  which has a half life of 1600 years  but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium  The appearance of an often thick layer of green or yellowish brown paint in devices from this period suggests a radioactive hazard  The radiation dose from an intact device is relatively low and usually not an acute risk  but the paint is dangerous if released and inhaled or ingested   7 1 2  Commercial use  Radium was once an additive in products such as toothpaste  hair creams  and even food items due to its supposed curative powers  Such products soon fell out of vogue and were prohibited by authorities in many countries after it was discovered they could have serious adverse health effects   See  for instance  Radithor or Revigator types of  Radium water  or  Standard Radium Solution for Drinking    Spas featuring radium rich water are still occasionally touted as beneficial  such as those in Misasa  Tottori  Japan  In the U S   nasal radium irradiation was also administered to children to prevent middle ear problems or enlarged tonsils from the late 1940s through the early 1970s   7 1 3  Medical use  Radium  usually in the form of radium chloride or radium bromide  was used in medicine to produce radon gas which in turn was used as a cancer treatment  for example  several of these radon sources were used in Canada in the 1920s and 1930s  However  many treatments that were used in the early 1900s are not used anymore because of the harmful effects radium bromide exposure caused  Some examples are anaemia  cancer  and genetic mutations   Howard Atwood Kelly  one of the founding physicians of Johns Hopkins Hospital  was a major pioneer in the medical use of radium to treat cancer  His first patient was his own aunt in 1904  who died shortly after surgery  Kelly was known to use excessive amounts of radium to treat various cancers and tumors  As a result  some of his patients died from high amounts of radium exposure  His method of radium application was inserting a radium capsule near the affected area then sewing the radium  points  directly to the tumor  This was the same method used to treat Henrietta Lacks  the host of the original HeLa cells  for cervical cancer  Currently  safer radioisotopes are usually used instead   7 2  Current  The isotope 223Ra  under the trade name Xofigo  was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2013 for use in medicine as a cancer treatment of bone metastasis   Radium is still used today as a radiation source in some industrial radiography devices to check for flawed metallic parts  similarly to X ray imaging  When mixed with beryllium  radium acts as a neutron source  Radium beryllium neutron sources are still sometimes used even today  but other materials such as polonium are now more common  about 1500 polonium beryllium neutron sources  with an individual activity of   have been used annually in the Soviet Union   8  Precautions  Radium is highly radioactive and its immediate daughter  radon gas  is also radioactive  When ingested  80% of the ingested radium leaves the body through the feces  while the other 20% goes into the bloodstream  mostly accumulating in the bones  Exposure to radium  internal or external  can cause cancer and other disorders  because radium and radon emit alpha and gamma rays upon their decay  which kill and mutate cells  At the time of the Manhattan Project in 1944  the  tolerance dose  for workers was set at 0 1 microgram of ingested radium   Some of the biological effects of radium were apparent from the start  The first case of so called  radium dermatitis  was reported in 1900  only 2 years after the element s discovery  The French physicist Antoine Becquerel carried a small ampoule of radium in his waistcoat pocket for 6 hours and reported that his skin became ulcerated  Marie Curie experimented with a tiny sample that she kept in contact with her skin for 10 hours  and noted that an ulcer appeared several days later  Handling of radium has been blamed for Curie s death due to aplastic anemia  However  most of radium s danger comes from its daughter radon  being a gas  it can enter the body far more readily than can its parent radium   9  See also  10  Notes  11  References  12  Bibliography  13  Further reading  14  External links  at The Periodic Table of
