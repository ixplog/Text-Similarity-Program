Pope Paul VI     born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini    26 September 1897 – 6 August 1978   reigned from 21 June 1963 to his death in 1978  Succeeding Pope John XXIII  he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965  implementing its numerous reforms  and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants  which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements   Montini served in the Vatican s Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954  While in the Secretariat of State  Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential co workers of Pope Pius XII  who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan  the largest Italian diocese  Montini automatically became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference  John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958  and after the death of John XXIII  Montini was considered one of his most likely successors   Upon his election to the papacy  Montini took the pontifical name Paul VI to indicate a renewed worldwide mission to spread the message of Christ  He re convoked the Second Vatican Council  which was automatically closed with the death of John XXIII  and gave it priority and direction  After the council had concluded its work  Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates  often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within Catholicism  The magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of Church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform policies of his predecessors and successors   Paul VI was a Marian devotee  speaking repeatedly to Marian congresses and mariological meetings  visiting Marian shrines and issuing three Marian encyclicals  Following his famous predecessor Saint Ambrose of Milan  he named Mary as the Mother of the Church during the Second Vatican Council   Paul VI sought dialogue with the world  with other Christians  other religions  and atheists  excluding nobody  He saw himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes of the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World  His positions on birth control  see Humanae vitae  and other issues were often controversial  especially in Western Europe and North America   Paul VI died on 6 August 1978  the Feast of the Transfiguration  in Castel Gandolfo  after a period of ill health  According to his will  he was buried in the grottos of the Vatican not in an ornate tomb  but in a grave in the ground  The diocesan process for the beatification of Paul VI began on 11 May 1993  and he was given the title  Servant of God   The diocesan process concluded its work in 1998   On 20 December 2012  Pope Benedict XVI  in an audience with the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints  declared that the late pontiff had lived a life of heroic virtue  which means that he can now be called  Venerable    A miracle attributed to the intercession of Paul VI was approved on 9 May 2014 by Pope Francis  The beatification ceremony for Paul VI was held on 19 October 2014  which means that he will be called  Blessed    His liturgical feast day is celebrated on the date of his birth  26 September  rather than the day of his death   1  Early life  Giovanni Battista Montini was born in the village of Concesio  in the province of Brescia  Lombardy in 1897  His father Giorgio Montini was a lawyer  journalist  director of the Catholic Action and member of the Italian Parliament  His mother was Giudetta Alghisi  from a family of rural nobility  He had two brothers  Francesco Montini  who became a physician  and Lodovico Montini  who became a lawyer and politician  On 30 September 1897  he was baptized in the name of Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini  He attended Cesare Arici  a school run by the Jesuits  and in 1916  he received a diploma from Arnaldo da Brescia  a public school in Brescia  His education was often interrupted by bouts of illness   In 1916  he entered the seminary to become a Roman Catholic priest  He was ordained priest on 29 May 1920 in Brescia and celebrated his first Holy Mass in Brescia in the Basilica of Santa Maria delle Grazie  Montini concluded his studies in Milan with a doctorate in Canon Law in the same year  Afterwards he studied at the Gregorian University  the University of Rome La Sapienza and  at the request of Giuseppe Pizzardo at the Accademia dei Nobili Ecclesiastici  At the age of twenty five  again at the request of Giuseppe Pizzardo  Montini entered the Secretariat of State in 1922  where he worked under Pizzardo together with Francesco Borgongini Duca  Alfredo Ottaviani  Carlo Grano  Domenico Tardini and Francis Spellman  In 1925 he helped found the publishing house Morcelliana in Brescia  focused on promoting a  Christian inspired culture    2  Vatican career  2 1  Polish nunciature  The only foreign diplomatic experience Montini underwent was his time in the nunciature in Warsaw  Poland in 1923  Like Achille Ratti before him  he felt confronted with the huge problem  not limited to Poland  of excessive nationalism   This form of nationalism treats foreigners as enemies  especially foreigners with whom one has common frontiers  Then one seeks the expansion of one s own country at the expense of the immediate neighbours  People grow up with a feeling of being hemmed in  Peace becomes a transient compromise between wars   When he was recalled to Rome he was happy to go  because  this concludes this episode of my life  which has provided useful  though not always joyful  experiences    After his Polish mission  Giovanni Battista Montini returned to Rome  where soon he began to work in the Vatican  Later  as pope  he wanted to return to Poland on a Marian pilgrimage  but he was not permitted by the Communist government  a request that it later could not deny to the native son Karol Wojtyla  who became Pope John Paul II   2 2  Pius XII  His organisational skills led him to a career in the Roman Curia  the papal civil service  In 1931  Pacelli appointed him to teach history at the Papal Academy for Diplomats In 1937  after his mentor Giuseppe Pizzardo was named a cardinal and was succeeded by Domenico Tardini  Montini was named Substitute for Ordinary Affairs under Cardinal Pacelli  the Secretary of State under Pope Pius XI  From Pius XI  whom he viewed with awe  he adopted the view  that learning is a life long process  and that history was the magister vitae teacher of life His immediate supervisor in the Vatican was Domenico Tardini  with whom he got along well  The election of Pacelli to the papacy in 1939  anticipated by everybody and openly promoted by Pope Pius XI in his last years  was a good omen for Montini  whose position was confirmed in the position under the new Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione  He met the pope every morning until 1954 and thus developed a rather close relationship   As war broke out  Maglione  Tardini and Montini were the main figures in the Vatican s State Department  as despatches originated from or addressed to them during the war years  Montini was in charge of taking care of the  ordinary affairs  of the Secretariat of State  which took much of the mornings of every working day  In the afternoon he moved to the third floor into the Office of the Private Secretary of the Pontiff  Pius XII did have a personal secretary  As did several popes before him  he delegated the secretarial functions to the State Secretariat  During the war years  thousands of letters from all parts of the world arrived at the desk of the pope  most of them asking for understanding  prayer and help  Montini was tasked to formulate the replies in the name of Pius XII  expressing his empathy  and understanding and providing help  where possible  At the request of the pope  he created an information office for prisoners of war and refugees  which in the years of its existence from 1939 until 1947 received almost ten million  9 891 497  information requests and produced over eleven million  11 293 511  answers about missing persons  Montini was several times openly attacked by Benito Mussolini s government as a politician  and meddling in politics  but each time he found powerful defenses by the Vatican  In 1944  Luigi Maglione died  and Pius XII appointed Tardini and Montini together as heads of the State Department  Montini s admiration was almost filial  when he described Pope Pius XII   At the request of the pope  together with Pascalina Lehnert  Ferdinando Baldelli and Otto Faller  he created the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza  which aided large number of Romans and refugees from everywhere with shelter  food and other material assistance  In Rome alone this organization distributed almost two million portions of free food in the year 1944  The Vatican and the Papal Residence Castel Gandolfo were opened to refugees  Some 15 000 persons lived in Castel Gandolfo alone  supported by the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza  At the request of Pius XII  Montini was also involved in the re establishment of Church Asylum  providing protection to hundreds of Allied soldiers  who had escaped from Axis prison camps  Jews  anti Fascists  Socialists  Communists  and after the liberation of Rome  German soldiers  partisans and other displaced persons  After the war and later as pope  Montini turned the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza  into the major charity  Caritas Italiana   3  Archbishop of Milan  After the death of Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster  OSB in 1954  Montini was appointed Archbishop of Milan  which made him the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference  Pope Pius XII presented the new Archbishop Giovanni Battista Montini  as his personal gift to Milan   He was consecrated in Saint Peter s Basilica by Cardinal Eugène Tisserant  the Dean of the College of Cardinals  since Pius XII was forced to stay in bed due to his severe illness   Pius XII delivered an address about Montini s appointment from his sick bed over radio to those assembled in St  Peter s Basilica on 12 December 1954  Both Montini and the pope had tears in their eyes when Montini parted for his dioceses with 1 000 churches  2 500 priests and 3 500 000 souls  On 5 January 1955  Montini formally took possession of his Cathedral of Milan  Montini  after a period of preparation  liked his new tasks as archbishop  connecting to all groups of faithful in Milan  He enjoyed meetings with intellectuals  artists and writers   3 1  Montini s philosophy  In his first months he showed his interest in working conditions and labour issues by personally contacting unions  associations and giving related speeches  Believing that churches are the only non utilitarian buildings in modern society and a most necessary place of spiritual rest  he initiated over 100 new Church buildings for service and contemplation   His public speeches were noticed not only in Milan but also in Rome and elsewhere  Some considered him a liberal  when he asked lay people to love not only Catholics but also schismatics  Protestants  Anglicans  the indifferent  Muslims  pagans  atheists  He engaged in friendly relations with a group of Anglican clergy visiting Milan in 1957 and a subsequently exchanged letters with the Archbishop of Canterbury  Geoffrey Fisher   He was not made a cardinal by Pius XII  who held no consistory and created no cardinals from the time he named Montini to Milan and his death four years later  Pope Pius XII revealed at the 1952 secret consistory that Montini and Tardini had declined appointments to the cardinalate   Montini and Angelo Roncalli were considered to be friends  but when Roncalli  as Pope John XXIII announced a new Ecumenical Council  Cardinal Montini reacted with disbelief and said to Giulio Bevilacqua   This old boy does not know what a hornets nest he is stirring up   He was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission in 1961  During the Council  his friend Pope John XXIII asked him to live in the Vatican  He was a member of the Commission for Extraordinary Affairs but did not engage himself much into the floor debates on various issues  His main advisor was Monsignore Giovanni Colombo  whom he later appointed to be his successor in Milan The Commission was greatly overshadowed by the insistence of John XXIII to have the Council complete all its work in one single session before Christmas 1962  to the 400th anniversary of the Council of Trent  an insistence which may have also been influenced by the Pope s recent knowledge that he had cancer   3 2  Pastoral progressivism  During his period in Milan  Montini was known as a progressive member of the Catholic hierarchy  Montini went new ways in pastoral care  which he reformed  He used his authority to ensure that the liturgical reforms of Pius XII were carried out at the local level and employed innovative methods to reach the people of Milan  Huge posters announced that 1 000 voices would speak to them from 10 to 24 November 1957  More than 500 priests and many bishops  cardinals and lay persons delivered 7 000 sermons in the period not only in churches but in factories  meeting halls  houses  courtyards  schools  offices  military barracks  hospitals  hotels and other places  where people meet  His goal was the re introduction of faith to a city without much religion   If only we can say Our Father and know what this means  then we would understand the Christian faith    Pius XII asked Archbishop Montini to Rome October 1957  where he gave the main presentation to the Second World Congress of Lay Apostolate  Previously as Pro Secretary  he had worked hard to unify a worldwide organization of lay people of 58 nations  representing 42 national organizations  He presented them to Pius XII in Rome in 1951  The second meeting in 1957 gave Montini an opportunity to express the lay apostolate in modern terms   Apostolate means love  We will love all  but especially those  who need help    We will love our time  our technology  our art  our sports  our world    3 3  Cardinal  Although some cardinals seem to have viewed him as papabile  a likely candidate to become pope  and may have received some votes in the 1958 conclave  Montini was not yet a cardinal  which made him an unlikely choice  Angelo Roncalli was elected pope on 28 October 1958 and assumed the name John XXIII  On 17 November 1958  L Osservatore Romano announced a consistory for the creation of new cardinals  Montini s name led the list  When the pope raised Montini to the cardinalate on 15 December 1958  he became Cardinal Priest of Ss  Silvestro e Martino ai Monti  He appointed him simultaneously to several Vatican congregations which resulted in many visits by Montini to Rome in the coming years   As a Cardinal  Montini journeyed to Africa  1962   where he visited Ghana  Sudan  Kenya  Congo  Rhodesia  South Africa  and Nigeria  After his journey  John XXIII gave him a private audience on his trip which lasted for several hours  In fifteen other trips he visited Brazil  1960  and the USA  1960   including New York City  Washington  DC  Chicago  the University of Notre Dame in Indiana  Boston  Philadelphia  and Baltimore  While a cardinal  he usually vacationed in Engelberg Abbey  a secluded Benedictine monastery in Switzerland   4  Papacy  4 1  Papal conclave  Montini was generally seen as the most likely successor to Pope John XXIII because of his closeness to both Popes Pius XII and John XXIII  his pastoral and administrative background  and his insight and determination  John XXIII  a newcomer to the Vatican at age 76  may have felt outflanked by the professional Roman Curia at times  Montini knew its most inner workings well due to the fact that he had worked there for a generation   Unlike the papabile cardinals Giacomo Lercaro of Bologna and Giuseppe Siri of Genoa  he was not identified with either the left or right  nor was he seen as a radical reformer  He was viewed as most likely to continue the Second Vatican Council  which already  without any tangible results  had lasted longer than anticipated by John XXIII  who had a vision but  did not have a clear agenda  His rhetoric seems to have had a note of over optimism  a confidence in progress  which was characteristic of the 1960s   When John XXIII died of stomach cancer on 3 June 1963  it triggered a conclave to elect a new pope   Montini was elected pope in sixth ballot of the papal conclave on 21 June and he took the pontifical name of  Paul VI   When the Dean of the College of Cardinals Eugene Tisserant asked if he accepted the election  Montini said  Accepto  in nomine Domini    I accept  in the name of the Lord    At one point during the conclave  it was claimed  Cardinal Gustavo Testa lost his temper and demanded that opponents of Montini halt their efforts to thwart his election   The white smoke first rose from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel at 11 22 am  Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani in his role as Protodeacon  announced to the public the successful election of Montini  When the new pope appeared on the central loggia  he gave the shorter episcopal blessing as his first Apostolic Blessing rather than the longer  traditional Urbi et Orbi   Paul VI knew what was coming  He wrote in his journal   The position is unique  It brings great solitude   I was solitary before  but now my solitude becomes complete and awesome    But he was not afraid of this new solitude which was expected of him  He recognized that it would be futile to seek much outside help  or to confide everything to others  He saw himself as alone  with God  The communication with him must be full and incommensurable   4 2  Reforms of papal ceremonial  Paul VI did away with much of the regal splendor of the papacy  He was the last pope to date to be crowned  his successor Pope John Paul I replaced the Papal Coronation  which Paul had already substantially modified  but which he left mandatory in his 1975 apostolic constitution Romano Pontifici Eligendo  with a Papal Inauguration  Paul VI donated his own Papal Tiara  a gift from his former Archdiocese of Milan  to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington  DC  where it is on permanent display in the Crypt  as a gift to American Catholics   In 1968  with the motu proprio Pontificalis Domus  he discontinued most of the ceremonial functions of the old Roman nobility at the papal court  save for the Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne  He also abolished the Palatine Guard and the Noble Guard  leaving the Swiss Guard as the sole military order of the Vatican   4 3  Completion of the Vatican Council  Paul VI decided to continue Vatican II  canon law dictates that a council is suspended at the death of a pope   and brought it to completion in 1965  Faced with conflicting interpretations and controversies  he directed the implementation of its reform goals   4 3 1  Ecumenical orientation  During Vatican II  the Council Fathers avoided statements which might anger Christians of other faiths  Cardinal Augustin Bea  the President of the Christian Unity Secretariat  always had the full support of Paul VI in his attempts to ensure that the Council language was friendly and open to the sensitivities of Protestant and Orthodox Churches  whom he had invited to all sessions at the request of Pope John XXIII  Bea also was strongly involved in the passage of Nostra Aetate  which regulates the Church s relations with the Jewish faith and members of other religions   4 3 2  Dialogue with the world  After his election as Bishop of Rome  Paul VI first met with the priests in his new dioceses  He told them that in Milan he started a dialogue with the modern world and asked them to seek contact with all people from all walks of life  Six days after his election he announced that he would continue Vatican II and convened the opening to take place on 29 September 1963  In a radio address to the world  Paul VI recalled the uniqueness of his predecessors  the strength of Pius XI  the wisdom and intelligence of Pius XII and the love of John XXIII  As  his pontifical goals  he mentioned the continuation and completion of Vatican II  the reform of the Canon Law and improved social peace and justice in the world  The Unity of Christianity would be central to his activities   4 3 3  The Council priorities of Paul VI  The pope re opened the Ecumenical Council on 29 September 1963 giving it four key priorities   A better understanding of the Catholic Church  Church reforms  Advancing the unity of Christianity  Dialogue with the world He reminded the council fathers that only a few years earlier Pope Pius XII had issued the encyclical Mystici Corporis about the mystical body of Christ  He asked them not to repeat or create new dogmatic definitions but to explain in simple words how the Church sees itself  He thanked the representatives of other Christian communities for their attendance and asked for their forgiveness if the Catholic Church is guilty for the separation  He also reminded the Council Fathers that many bishops from the east could not attend because the governments in the East did not permit their journeys   4 3 4  Third and fourth sessions  Paul VI opened the third period on 14 September 1964  telling the Council Fathers that he viewed the text about the Church as the most important document to come out from the Council  As the Council discussed the role of bishops in the papacy  Paul VI issued an explanatory note confirming the primacy of the papacy  a step which was viewed by some as meddling in the affairs of the Council American bishops pushed for a speedy resolution on religious freedom  but Paul VI insisted this to be approved together with related texts such as ecumenism  The Pope concluded the session on 21 November 1964  with the formal pronouncement of Mary as Mother of the Church   Between the third and fourth sessions the pope announced reforms in the areas of Roman Curia  revision of Canon Law  regulations for mixed marriages involving several faiths  and birth control issues  He opened the final session of the council  concelebrating with bishops from countries where the Church was persecuted  Several texts proposed for his approval had to be changed  But all texts were finally agreed upon  The Council was concluded on 8 December 1965  the Feast of the Immaculate Conception   In the final session of the Council  Paul VI announced that he would open the canonization processes of his immediate predecessors  Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII   4 3 5  Universal call to holiness  According to Pope Paul VI   the most characteristic and ultimate purpose of the teachings of the Council  is the universal call to holiness   all the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status  are called to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity  by this holiness as such a more human manner of living is promoted in this earthly society   This teaching is found in Lumen Gentium  the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church  promulgated by Paul VI on November 21  1964   4 4  Church reforms  4 4 1  Synod of Bishops  On 14 September 1965  he established the Synod of Bishops as a permanent institution of the Church and an advisory body to the papacy  Several meetings were held on specific issues during his pontificate  such as the Synod of Bishops on evangelization in the modern world  which started 9 September 1974   4 4 2  Curia reform  Pope Paul VI knew the Roman Curia well  having worked there for a generation from 1922 to 1954  He implemented his reforms in stages  rather than in one fell swoop  On 1 March 1968  he issued a regulation  a process that had been initiated by Pius XII and continued by John XXIII  On 28 March  with Pontificalis Domus  and in several additional Apostolic Constitutions in the following years  he revamped the entire Curia  which included reduction of bureaucracy  streamlining of existing congregations and a broader representation of non Italians in the curial positions   4 4 3  Papal elections  Paul VI revolutionized papal elections by ordering that only cardinals below the age of eighty might participate in future conclaves  In Ecclesiae Sanctae  his motu proprio of 6 August 1966  he further invited all bishops to offer their retirement to the pontiff no later than the completion of their 75th year of age  This requirement was extended to all Cardinals of the Catholic Church on 21 November 1970  With these two stipulations  the Pope filled several positions with younger bishops and cardinals  and further internationalized the Roman Curia in light of several resignations due to age   4 4 4  Mass of Paul VI  Reform of the liturgy had been a part of the liturgical movements in the 20th century mainly in France  Robert Schuman  and Germany  Romano Guardini  which were officially recognized by Pius XII in his encyclical Mediator Dei  During the pontificate of Pius XII  the Vatican eased regulations on the use of Latin in Roman Catholic liturgies  permitting some use of vernacular languages during baptisms  funerals and other events  In 1951 and 1955  the Easter liturgies underwent revision  most notably including the reintroduction of the Easter Triduum  The Second Vatican Council made no changes to the Roman Missal  but in the document Sacrosanctum Concilium mandated that a general revision of it take place  After the Vatican Council  in April 1969  Paul VI approved the  new Order of Mass  promulgated in 1970  as stated in the Acta Apostolica Sedis to  end experimentation  with the Mass and which included the introduction of three new Eucharistic Prayers to what was up to then a single Roman Canon   The Mass of Paul VI was also in Latin but approval was given for the use of vernacular languages  There had been other instructions issued by the Pope in 1964  1967  1968  1969 and 1970 which centered on the reform of all liturgies of the Roman Church  These major reforms were not welcomed by all and in all countries  The sudden apparent  outlawing  of the 400 year old Mass  the last typical edition of which being promulgated only a few years earlier in 1962 by Paul s predecessor  Pope John XXIII  was not always explained well  Further experimentation with the new Mass by liturgists  such as the usage of pop folk music  as opposed to the Gregorian Chant advocated by Pope Pius X   along with concurrent changes in the order of sanctuaries  was viewed by some as vandalism  In 2007  Pope Benedict XVI clarified that the 1962 Mass of John XXIII and the 1970 Mass of Paul VI are two forms of the same Roman Rite  the first  which had never been  juridically abrogated   now being an  extraordinary form of the Roman Rite   while the other  obviously is and continues to be the normal Form – the Forma ordinaria – of the Eucharistic Liturgy    4 5  Relations and dialogues  To Paul VI  a dialogue with all of humanity was essential not as an aim but as a means to find the truth  Dialogue according to Paul  is based on full equality of all participants  This equality is rooted in the common search for the truth He said   Those who have the truth  are in a position as not having it  because they are forced to search for it every day in a deeper and more perfect way  Those who do not have it  but search for it with their whole heart  have already found it    4 5 1  Dialogues  In 1964  Paul VI created a Secretariat for non Christians  later renamed the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and a year later a new Secretariat  later Pontifical Council  for Dialogue with Non Believers  This latter was in 1993 incorporated by Pope John Paul II in the Pontifical Council for Culture  which he had established in 1982  In 1971  Paul VI created a papal office for economic development and catastrophic assistance  To foster common bonds with all persons of good will  he decreed an annual peace day to be celebrated on January first of every year  Trying to improve the condition of Christians behind the Iron Curtain  Paul VI engaged in dialogue with Communist authorities at several levels  receiving Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Nikolai Podgorny in 1966 and 1967 in the Vatican  The situation of the Church in Hungary  Poland and Romania  improved during his pontificate   4 5 2  Foreign travels  Pope Paul VI became the first pope to visit six continents  and was the most travelled pope in history to that time  earning the nickname  the Pilgrim Pope   With his travels he opened new avenues for the papacy  which were continued by his successors John Paul II and Benedict XVI  He travelled to the Holy Land in 1964  to the Eucharistic Congresses in Bombay  India and Bogotá  Colombia  In 1966  however  he was twice denied permission to visit Poland for the 1 000th anniversary of the baptism of Poland  In 1967  however  fifty years after the first apparition  he visited Fátima in Portugal  He undertook a pastoral visit to Africa in 1969  On 27 November 1970 he was the target of an assassination attempt at Manila International Airport in the Philippines  He was only lightly stabbed by the would be assassin Benjamín Mendoza y Amor Flores  who was subdued by the pope s personal secretary  Pasquale Macchi   During the pope s first visit to the United States in October 1965  as the U S  involvement in the Vietnam War escalated under President Johnson  Paul VI pleaded for peace before the UN   Pope Paul VI sent one of 73 Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages to NASA for the historic first lunar landing  The message still rests on the lunar surface today  It has the Psalm 8 and the pope wrote   To the Glory of the name of God who gives such power to men  we ardently pray for this wonderful beginning    4 5 3  New diplomacy  Like his predecessor Pius XII  Paul VI put much emphasis on the dialogue with all nations of the world through establishing diplomatic relations  The number of foreign embassies accredited to the Vatican doubled during his pontificate  This was a reflection of a new understanding between Church and State  which had been formulated first by Pius XI and Pius XII but decreed by Vatican II  The pastoral constitution Gaudium et Spes stated that the Catholic Church is not bound to any form of government and willing to cooperate with all forms  The Church maintained its right to select bishops on its own without any interference by the State   4 6  Theology  4 6 1  Mariology  Pope Paul VI made extensive contributions to Mariology  theological teaching and devotions  during his pontificate  He attempted to present the Marian teachings of the Church in view of her new ecumenical orientation  In his inaugural encyclical Ecclesiam Suam  section below   the pope called Mary the ideal of Christian perfection  He regards  devotion to the Mother of God as of paramount importance in living the life of the Gospel    4 6 2  Encyclicals    Mense maio The encyclical Mense maio  from 29 April 1965  focused on the Virgin Mary  to whom traditionally the month of May is dedicated as the Mother of God  Paul VI writes that Mary is rightly to be regarded as the way by which people are led to Christ  Therefore  the person who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ    Ecclesiam Suam Ecclesiam Suam was given at St  Peter s  Rome  on the Feast of the Transfiguration  6 August 1964  the second year of his Pontificate  It is considered an important document  identifying the Catholic Church with the Body of Christ  A later Council document Lumen Gentium stated that the Church subsists in the Body of Christ  raising questions as to the difference between  is  and  subsists in   Paul VI appealed to  all people of good will  and discussed necessary dialogues within the Church and between the Churches and with atheism    Mysterium fidei On 3 September 1965  Paul VI issued Mysterium fidei  on the mystery of the faith  He opposed relativistic notions which would have given the Eucharist a symbolic character only  The Church  according to Paul VI  has no reason to give up the deposit of faith in such a vital matter    Sacerdotalis caelibatus Sacerdotalis caelibatus  Latin for  Of the celibate priesthood    promulgated on 24 June 1967  defends the Catholic Church s tradition of priestly celibacy in the West  This encyclical was written in the wake of Vatican II  when the Catholic Church was questioning and revising many long held practices  Priestly celibacy is considered a discipline rather than dogma  and some had expected that it might be relaxed  In response to these questions  the Pope reaffirms the discipline as a long held practice with special importance in the Catholic Church  The encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus from 24 June 1967  confirms the traditional Church teaching  that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for Roman Catholic priests  Celibacy symbolizes the reality of the kingdom of God amid modern society  The priestly celibacy is closely linked to the sacramental priesthood  However  during his pontificate Paul VI was considered generous in permitting bishops to grant laicization of priests who wanted to leave the sacerdotal state  a position which was drastically reversed by John Paul II in 1980 and cemented in the 1983 Canon Law that only the pope can in exceptional circumstances grant laicization   Populorum Progressio  Populorum progressio  released on 26 March 1967  dealt with the topic of  the development of peoples  and that the economy of the world should serve mankind and not just the few  It touches on a variety of traditional principles of Catholic social teaching  the right to a just wage  the right to security of employment  the right to fair and reasonable working conditions  the right to join a union and strike as a last resort  and the universal destination of resources and goods   In addition  Populorum Progressio opines that real peace in the world is conditional on justice  He repeats his demands expressed in Bombay in 1964 for a large scale World Development Organization  as a matter of international justice and peace  He rejected notions to instigate revolution and force in changing economic conditions    Humanae vitae Of his eight encyclicals  Pope Paul VI is best known for his encyclical Humanae vitae  Of Human Life  subtitled On the Regulation of Birth   published on 25 July 1968  In this encyclical he reaffirmed the Catholic Church s traditional view of marriage and marital relations and a continued condemnation of artificial birth control  There were two Papal committees and numerous independent experts looking into the latest advancement of science and medicine on the question of artificial birth control  which were noted by the Pope in his encyclical The expressed views of Paul VI reflected the teachings of his predecessors  especially Pius XI  Pius XII and John XXIII and never changed  as he repeatedly stated them in the first few years of his Pontificate  To the pope as to all his predecessors  marital relations are much more than a union of two people  They constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God  in which the two persons create a new person materially  while God completes the creation by adding the soul  For this reason  Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of Humanae vitae that the transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator  This divine partnership  according to Paul VI  does not allow for arbitrary human decisions  which may limit divine providence  The Pope does not paint an overly romantic picture of marriage  marital relations are a source of great joy  but also of difficulties and hardships  The question of human procreation exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as biology  psychology  demography or sociology  The reason for this  according to Paul VI  is that married love takes its origin from God  who  is love   From this basic dignity  he defines his position   The reaction to the encyclical s continued prohibitions of artificial birth control was very mixed  In Italy  Spain  Portugal and Poland  the encyclical was welcomed  In Latin America  much support developed for the Pope and his encyclical  As World Bank President Robert McNamara declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources  doctors in La Paz  Bolivia called it insulting that money should be exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation  In Colombia  Cardinal archbishop Aníbal Muñoz Duque declared  if American conditionality undermines Papal teachings  we prefer not to receive one cent  The Senate of Bolivia passed a resolution stating that Humanae vitae could be discussed in its implications for individual consciences  but was of greatest significance because the papal document defended the rights of developing nations to determine their own population policies  The Jesuit Journal Sic dedicated one edition to the encyclical with supportive contributions   Paul VI was concerned but not surprised by the negative reaction in Western Europe and the United States  He fully anticipated this reaction to be a temporary one   Don t be afraid   he reportedly told Edouard Gagnon on the eve of the encyclical   in twenty years time they ll call me a prophet   His biography on the Vatican s website notes of his reaffirmations of priestly celibacy and the traditional teaching on contraception that   t he controversies over these two pronouncements tended to overshadow the last years of his pontificate   Pope John Paul II later reaffirmed and expanded upon Humanae vitae with the encyclical Evangelium vitae   4 7  Ecumenism and ecumenical relations  After the Council  Paul VI contributed in two ways to the continued growth of ecumenical dialogue  The separated brothers and sisters  as he called them  were not able to contribute to the Council as invited observers  After the Council  many of them took initiative to seek out their Catholic counterparts and the Pope in Rome  who welcomed such visits  But the Catholic Church itself recognized from the many previous ecumenical encounters  that much needed to be done within  to be an open partner for ecumenism  To those who are entrusted the highest and deepest truth and therefore  so Paul VI  believed that he had the most difficult part to communicate  Ecumenical dialogue  in the view of Paul VI  requires from a Catholic the whole person  one s entire reason  will  and heart  Paul VI  like Pius XII before him  was reluctant to give in on a lowest possible point  And yet  Paul felt compelled to admit his ardent Gospel based desire to be everything to everybody and to help all people Being the successor of Peter  he felt the words of Christ   Do you love me more  like a sharp knife penetrating to the marrow of his soul  These words meant to Paul VI love without limits  and they underscore the Church s fundamental approach to ecumenism   4 7 1  Orthodox  Paul VI visited the Orthodox Patriarchs of Jerusalem and Constantinople in 1964 and 1967  He was the first pope since the ninth century to visit the East  labeling the Eastern Churches as sister Churches  He was also the first pope in centuries to meet the heads of various Eastern Orthodox faiths  Notably  his meeting with Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I in 1964 in Jerusalem led to rescinding the excommunications of the Great Schism  which took place in 1054   This was a significant step towards restoring communion between Rome and Constantinople  It produced the Catholic Orthodox Joint declaration of 1965  which was read out on 7 December 1965  simultaneously at a public meeting of the Second Vatican Council in Rome and at a special ceremony in Istanbul  The declaration did not end the schism  but showed a desire for greater reconciliation between the two churches  In May 1973  the Coptic Patriarch Shenouda III of Alexandria visited the Vatican  where he met three times with Pope Paul VI  A common declaration and a joint Creed issued after the visit demonstrated that there are virtually no more theological discrepancies between the Coptic and Roman Catholic Churches   4 7 2  Anglicans  Paul VI was the first pope to receive an Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury  Michael Ramsey in official audience as Head of Church  after the private audience visit of Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher to Pope John XXIII on 2 December 1960  Ramsey met Paul three times during his visit and opened the Anglican Centre in Rome to increase their mutual knowledge  He praised Paul VI and his contributions in the service of unity  Paul replied that  by entering into our house  you are entering your own house  we are happy to open our door and heart to you   The two Church leaders signed a common declaration  which put an end to the disputes of the past and outlined a common agenda for the future   Cardinal Augustin Bea  the head of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity  added at the end of the visit   Let us move forward in Christ  God wants it  Humanity is waiting for it   Unmoved by a harsh condemnation by the Congregation of Faith on mixed marriages precisely at this time of the visit  Paul VI and Ramsey appointed a preparatory commission which was to put the common agenda into practice on such issues as mixed marriages  This resulted in a joint Malta declaration  the first joint agreement on the Creed since the Reformation  Paul VI was a good friend of the Anglican Church  which he described as  our beloved sister Church   This description was unique to Paul and not used by later popes   4 7 3  Protestants  In 1965  Paul VI decided on the creation of a joint working group with the World Council of Churches to map all possible avenues of dialogue and cooperation  In the following three years  eight sessions were held which resulted in many joint proposals  It was proposed to work closely together in areas of social justice and development and Third World Issues such as hunger and poverty  On the religious side  it was agreed to share together in the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity  to be held every year  The joint working group was to prepare texts which were to be used by all Christians  On 19 July 1968  the meeting of the World Council of Churches took place in Uppsala  Sweden  which Pope Paul called a sign of the times  He sent his blessing in an ecumenical manner   May the Lord bless everything you do for the case of Christian Unity   The World Council of Churches decided on including Catholic theologians in its committees  provided they have the backing of the Vatican   The Lutherans were the first Protestant Church offering a dialogue to the Catholic Church in September 1964 in Reykjavík  Iceland  It resulted in joint study groups of several issues  The dialogue with the Methodist Church began October 1965  after its representatives officially applauded remarkable changes  friendship and cooperation of the past five years  The Reformed Churches entered four years later into a dialogue with the Catholic Church  The President of the Lutheran World Federation and member of the central committee of the World Council of Churches Fredrik A  Schiotz stated during the 450th anniversary of the Reformation  that earlier commemorations were viewed almost as a triumph  Reformation should be celebrated as a thanksgiving to God  his truth and his renewed life  He welcomed the announcement of Pope Paul VI to celebrate the 1900 anniversary of the death of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul  and promised the participation and cooperation in the festivities   Paul VI supported the new found harmony and cooperation with Protestants on so many levels  When Cardinal Augustin Bea went to see him for permission for a joint Catholic Protestant translation of the Bible with Protestant Bible societies  the pope walked towards him and exclaimed   as far as the cooperation with Bible societies is concerned  I am totally in favour   He issued a formal approval on Pentecost 1967  the feast on which the Holy Spirit descended on the Christians  overcoming all linguistic difficulties  according to Christian tradition   4 8  Beatifications and canonizations  Paul VI beatified a total of 38 individuals in his pontificate and he canonized 84 saints in 21 causes  Among the beatifications included Maximilian Kolbe  1971  and the Korean Martyrs  1968   He canonized saints such as Nikola Tavelić  1970  and the Ugandan Martyrs  1964    4 9  Consistories  Pope Paul VI held six consistories between 1965 and 1977 that raised 143 men to the cardinalate in his fifteen years as pope  They were held on 22 February 1965  27 cardinals  26 June 1967  27 cardinals  28 April 1969  34 cardinals  5 March 1973  30 cardinals  24 May 1976  20 cardinals  and  27 June 1977  4 cardinals   The next three popes  including Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI  were created cardinals by him  His immediate successor  Albino Luciani  who took the name John Paul I  was created a cardinal in the consistory of 5 March 1973  Karol Wojtyła was created a cardinal in the consistory of 26 June 1967  Joseph Ratzinger was created a cardinal in the small four appointment consistory of 27 June 1977  which also included Bernardin Gantin from Benin  Africa  This became the last of Paul VI s consistories before his death in August 1978  Pope Paul was asked towards the end of his papacy whether he would retire at age 80  he replied  Kings can abdicate  Popes cannot    With the six consistories  Paul VI continued the internationalization policies started by Pius XII in 1946 and continued by John XXIII  In his 1976 consistory  five of twenty cardinals originated from Africa  one of them a son of a tribal chief with fifty wives  Several prominent Latin Americans like Eduardo Francisco Pironio of Argentina  Luis Aponte Martinez of Puerto Rico and Eugênio de Araújo Sales and Aloisio Lorscheider from Brazil were also elevated by him  There were voices within the Church at the time saying that the European period of the Church was coming to a close  a view shared by Britain s Cardinal Basil Hume  At the same time  the members of the College of Cardinals lost some of their previous influences  after Paul VI decreed  that not only cardinals but also bishops too may participate in committees of the Roman Curia  The age limit of eighty years imposed by the Pope  a numerical increase of Cardinals by almost 100%  and a reform of the regal vestments of the  Princes of the Church  further contributed to a service oriented perception of Cardinals under his pontificate  The increased number of Cardinals from the Third World and the papal emphasis on related issues was nevertheless welcomed by many in Western Europe   5  Final months and death  On 16 March 1978  his friend from FUCI student days Aldo Moro  a Christian Democratic politician  was kidnapped by the Red Brigades  which kept the pope in suspense for 55 days  On 20 April  Moro directly appealed to the pope to intervene as Pope Pius XII had intervened in the case of Professor Giuliano Vassalli in the same situation  The eighty year old Paul VI wrote a letter to the Red Brigades   Some in the Italian government accused the pope of treating the Red Brigades too kindly  However  he continued looking for ways to pay ransom for Moro – but to no avail  On 9 May  the bullet riddled body of Aldo Moro was found in a car in Rome  Pope Paul VI later celebrated his State Funeral Mass   Pope Paul VI left the Vatican to go to the papal summer residence  Castel Gandolfo  on 14 July 1978  visiting on the way the tomb of Cardinal Giuseppe Pizzardo  who had introduced him to the Vatican half a century earlier  Although he was sick  he agreed to see the new Italian President Sandro Pertini for over two hours  In the evening he watched a Western on TV  happy only when he saw  horses  the most beautiful animals that God had created   He had breathing problems and needed oxygen  On Sunday  at the Feast of the Transfiguration  he was tired  but wanted to say the Angelus  He was neither able nor permitted to do so and instead stayed in bed  his temperature rising   From his bed he participated in Sunday Mass at 18 00  After communion  the pope suffered a massive heart attack  after which he continued to live for three hours  On 6 August 1978 at 21 41  Pope Paul VI died at Castel Gandolfo  He is buried beneath the floor of Saint Peter s Basilica with other popes  In his will  he requested to be buried in the  true earth  and therefore  he does not have an ornate sarcophagus but an in ground grave   6  Cause for beatification  The diocesan process for beatification of the Servant of God Paul VI began on 11 May 1993 by Pope John Paul II after nihil obstat   nothing against   was declared the previous 18 March  The title of Servant of God is the first of four steps toward possible canonization  The diocesan process concluded its business on 18 March 1998   On 20 December 2012  Pope Benedict XVI approved the declaration of Pope Paul VI as a person of  heroic virtue   granting him the title of  Venerable    In December 2013  Vatican officials approved a supposed miracle that was attributed to the intercession of the late pontiff which was the curing of an unborn child in California  U S A in the 1990s  It was expected that Pope Francis would approve the miracle in the near future  thus  warranting the beatification of the late pontiff  In February 2014  it was reported that the consulting Vatican theologians to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints recognized the miracle attributed to the late pontiff   On 24 April 2014  it was reported in the Italian magazine Credere that the late pope could possibly be beatified on 19 October 2014  This report from the magazine further stated that several cardinals and bishops would meet on 5 May to confirm the miracle that had previously been approved  and then present it to Pope Francis who may sign the decree for beatification shortly after that  The Congregation for the Causes of Saints held that meeting and positively concluded that the healing was indeed a miracle that could be attributed to the late pope  The matter shall now soon be presented to the pope for approval   The miracle was formally approved on 9 May 2014 by Pope Francis in an audience with the Angelo Amato  Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints  The beatification ceremony for Paul VI was held on 19 October 2014  which means that he will be titled as  Blessed   One final miracle will be needed for his canonization   7  Legacy and controversies  The pontificate of Paul VI continued the opening and internationalization of the Church started under Pius XII  He implemented the reforms of John XXIII and Vatican II  Yet  unlike these popes  Paul VI faced criticism throughout his papacy from both traditionalists and liberals for steering a middle course during Vatican II and during the implementation of its reforms thereafter  He expressed a desire for peace during the Vietnam War   On basic Church teachings  the pope was unwavering  On the tenth anniversary of Humanae vitae  he reconfirmed this teaching  In his style and methodology  he was a disciple of Pius XII  whom he deeply revered  He suffered for the attacks on Pius XII for his alleged silences during the Holocaust  Pope Paul VI suffered in comparison with his predecessors  He was not credited with an encyclopedic memory  nor a gift for languages  nor a brilliant writing style of Pius XII  nor did he have the charisma and outpouring love  sense of humor and human warmth of John XXIII  He took on himself the unfinished reform work of these two popes  bringing them diligently with great humility and common sense and without much fanfare to conclusion  In doing so  Paul VI saw himself following in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul  torn to several directions as Saint Paul  who said   I am attracted to two sides at once  because the Cross always divides    The new theological freedoms  which he fostered – unlike his predecessors and successors  Paul VI refused to excommunicate – resulted in a pluralism of opinions and uncertainties among the faithful  He admonished but did not punish those with other views  New demands were voiced  which were taboo at the Council  the reintegration of divorced Catholics  the sacramental character of the confession  and the role of women in the Church and its ministries  Conservatives complained  that  women wanted to be priests  priests wanted to get married  bishops became regional popes and theologians claimed absolute teaching authority  Protestants claimed equality  homosexuals and divorced called for full acceptance   Changes such as the reorientation of the liturgy  alterations to the ordinary of the Mass  alterations to the liturgical calendar in the motu proprio Mysterii Paschalis  and the relocation of the tabernacle were controversial among some Catholics   Paul VI did renounce many traditional symbols of the papacy and the Catholic Church  some of his changes to the papal dress were reversed by Pope Benedict XVI in the early 21st century  Refusing a Vatican army of colourful military uniforms from centuries  he got rid of them  He became the first pope to visit five continents  Paul VI systematically continued and completed the efforts of his predecessors  to turn the Euro centric Church into a Church of the world  by integrating the bishops from all continents in its government and in the Synods which he convened  His 6 August 1967 motu proprio Pro Comperto Sane opened the Roman Curia to the bishops of the world  Until then  only Cardinals could be leading members of the Curia   Some critiqued Paul VI s decision  the newly created Synod of Bishops had an advisory role only and could not make decisions on their own  although the Council decided exactly that  During the pontificate of Paul VI  five such synods took place  and he is on record of implementing all their decisions  Related questions were raised about the new National Bishop Conferences  which became mandatory after Vatican II  Others questioned his Ostpolitik and contacts with Communism and the deals he engaged in for the faithful   The pope clearly suffered from the responses within the Church to Humanae vitae  While most regions and bishops supported the pontiff  a small but important part of them especially in the Netherlands  Canada  and Germany openly disagreed with the pope  which deeply wounded him for the rest of his life  When Patrick O Boyle  the Cardinal Archbishop of Washington  DC  disciplined several priests for publicly dissenting from this teaching  the pope encouraged him   According to some sources  as Paul became increasingly ill  he spoke of possibly abdicating the papal throne and going into retirement  provided he could not fulfill the duties of the papacy in the fullest  His position mirrors identical statements attributed to Pius XI  a Pope may suffer but he must be able to function  and  repeatedly by Pius XII to the same effect  Pope Paul  reflecting on the description of Hamlet  wrote in a private note in 1978 about himself   This inner joy seems to have been a characteristic of Paul VI  His confessor  the Jesuit Paolo Dezza  arrived at the Vatican every Friday evening at 19 00 to hear confession of Paul VI  The only words he ever spoke about his long service to Paul VI during his pontificate were   that this pope is a man of great joy   After the death of Pope Paul VI  Dezza was more outspoken  saying that  if Paul VI was not a saint  when he was elected Pope  he became one during his pontificate  I was able to witness not only with what energy and dedication he toiled for Christ and the Church but also and above all  how much he suffered for Christ and the Church  I always admired not only his deep inner resignation but also his constant abandonment to divine providence   It is this character trait  which led to the opening of the process of beatification and canonization for Paul VI   8  See also
