The Mariner program was a program conducted by the American space agency NASA in conjunction with Jet Propulsion Laboratory  JPL  that launched a series of robotic interplanetary probes designed to investigate Mars  Venus and Mercury from 1962 to 1973  The program included a number of firsts  including the first planetary flyby  the first pictures from another planet  the first planetary orbiter  and the first gravity assist maneuver   Of the ten vehicles in the Mariner series  seven were successful and three were lost  The planned Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 vehicles evolved into Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 of the Voyager program  while the Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars orbiters were enlarged versions of the Mariner 9 spacecraft  Other Mariner based spacecraft  launched since Voyager  included the Magellan probe to Venus  and the Galileo probe to Jupiter  A second generation Mariner spacecraft  called the Mariner Mark II series  eventually evolved into the Cassini–Huygens probe  now in orbit around Saturn   The total cost of the Mariner program was approximately $554 million   1  Basic layout  All Mariner spacecraft were based on a hexagonal or octagonal  bus   which housed all of the electronics  and to which all components were attached  such as antennae  cameras  propulsion  and power sources  All of the Mariners launched after Mariner 2 had four solar panels for power  except for Mariner 10  which had two  and Mariner 2  which was based on the Ranger Lunar probe  Additionally  all except Mariner 1  Mariner 2 and Mariner 5 had TV cameras   The first five Mariners were launched on Atlas Agena rockets  while the last five used the Atlas Centaur  All Mariner based probes after Mariner 10 used the Titan IIIE  Titan IV unmanned rockets or the Space Shuttle with a solid fueled Inertial Upper Stage and multiple planetary flybys   2  Mariners 1 and 2  Mariner 1  P 37  and Mariner 2  P 38  were two deep space probes making up NASA s Mariner R project  The primary goal of the project was to develop and launch two spacecraft sequentially to the near vicinity of the planet Venus  receive communications from the spacecraft and to perform radiometric temperature measurements of the planet  A secondary objective was to make interplanetary magnetic field and or particle measurements on the way to Venus and in the vicinity of Venus  Mariner 1  designated Mariner R 1  was launched on July 22  1962  but was destroyed approximately 5 minutes after liftoff by the Air Force Range Safety Officer when its malfunctioning Atlas Agena rocket went off course  Mariner 2  designated Mariner R 2  was launched on August 27  1962  sending it on a 3½ month flight to Venus  The mission was a success  and Mariner 2 became the first spacecraft to have flown by another planet

vehicle s nose fairing failed to jettison  Its sister ship  Mariner 4  launched on November 28  1964  was the first successful flyby of the planet Mars and gave the first glimpse of Mars at close range   Mission  Mars flyby  Mass  261 kg  575 lb   Sensors  camera with digital tape recorder  about 20 pictures   cosmic dust  solar plasma  trapped radiation  cosmic rays  magnetic fields  radio

atmosphere with radio waves  scan its brightness in ultraviolet light  and sample the solar particles and magnetic field fluctuations above the planet   Mission  Venus flyby  Mass  245 kg  540 lb

flew over the equator and southern hemisphere of the planet Mars   Mission  Mars flybys  Mass 413 kg  908 lb   Sensors  wide  and narrow angle cameras with digital tape recorder  infrared spectrometer

Mariners 8 and 9  Mariner 8 and Mariner 9 were identical sister craft designed to map the Martian surface simultaneously  but Mariner 8 was lost in a launch vehicle failure  Its identical sister craft  Mariner 9  was launched in May 1971 and became the first artificial satellite of Mars  It entered Martian orbit in November 1971 and began photographing the surface and analyzing the atmosphere with its infrared and ultraviolet instruments   Mission  orbit Mars  Mass 998 kg  2 200 lb   Sensors  wide  and narrow angle cameras with digital tape recorder  infrared spectrometer and radiometer

when it is projected to fall out of orbit and into the Martian atmosphere   7  Mariner 10  The Mariner 10 spacecraft launched on November 3  1973 and was the first to use a gravity assist trajectory  accelerating as it entered the gravitational influence of Venus  then being flung by the planet s gravity onto a slightly different course to reach Mercury  It was also the first spacecraft to encounter two planets at close range  and for 33 years the only spacecraft to photograph Mercury in closeup   Mission  Venus and Mercury flybys  Mass  433 kg  952 lb   Sensors  twin narrow angle

mission was scaled back to be a flyby of Jupiter and Saturn  and renamed the Mariner Jupiter Saturn probes  As the program progressed  the name was later changed to Voyager  as the probe designs began to differ greatly from previous Mariner missions  The Voyager program launched Voyager 1 and Voyager 2   9  References  10  See also  Mariner 11  Mariner 12  Mariner Mark II  Mariner  crater   Pioneer
