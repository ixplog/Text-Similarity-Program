In Great Britain  National Rail is the trading name licensed for use by the Association of Train Operating Companies  ATOC   an unincorporated association whose membership consists of the passenger train operating companies  TOCs  of Great Britain that run the passenger services previously provided by the British Railways Board  from 1965 using the brand name British Rail   National Rail generally does not include services that do not have a BR history  this distinction is important because National Rail services share a ticketing structure and inter availability that do not necessarily extend to other services  The name and the accompanying double arrow symbol are the intellectual property of the Secretary of State for Transport   The National Rail  NR  logo was introduced by ATOC in 1999  and was used on the Great Britain public timetable for the first time in the edition valid from 26 September in that year  Rules for its use are set out in the Corporate Identity Style Guidelines published by ATOC  available on its website  The NR title is sometimes described as a  brand  but according to ATOC manuals this is incorrect  this however is in conflict with the registration information for the name and logo as recorded by the UK Intellectual Property Office  The 2000 guidelines said   It has not been designed as a brand or identity  but to explain to rail travellers that there is a National Railway network and material carrying this descriptor covers all passenger Train Companies   Consistent use of the NR logo on signs and maps  however  points travellers to railway stations  As it was used by British Rail  the single operator before franchising  its use also maintains continuity and public familiarity  and it avoids the need to replace signage   1  National Rail and Network Rail  National Rail should not be confused with Network Rail  National Rail is a title used to promote passenger railway services  and providing some harmonisation for passengers  e g  tickets to all London Terminals   while Network Rail is the organisation owning and managing most of the fixed assets  tracks  signals etc   of the railway network   The two networks are generally coincident where passenger services are run  Most major Network Rail lines carry freight traffic and some lines are freight only  There are some scheduled passenger services on their own privately managed  non Network Rail lines  for example Heathrow Express which also partly runs on Network Rail and the London Underground also overlaps with Network Rail in places   2  Train operating companies  TOCs   About twenty privately owned train operating companies  each franchised for a defined term by government  operate passenger trains on the main rail network in Great Britain  ATOC is the trade association representing the TOCs and provides core services  including the provision of the National Rail Enquiries service  It also runs Rail Settlement Plan  which allocates ticket revenue to the various TOCs  and Rail Staff Travel  which manages travel facilities for railway staff  It does not compile the national timetable  which is the joint responsibility of the Office of Rail Regulation  allocation of paths  and Network Rail  timetable production and publication    3  Design and marketing  Since the privatisation of British Rail there is no longer a single approach to design on railways in Great Britain  The look and feel of signage  liveries and marketing material is largely the preserve of the individual TOCs   However  National Rail continues to use BR s famous double arrow symbol  designed by Gerald Burney of the Design Research Unit  It has been incorporated in the National Rail logotype and is displayed on tickets  the National Rail website and other publicity  The trademark rights to the double arrow symbol remain state owned  being vested in the Secretary of State for Transport   The double arrow was already prescribed for indicating a  railway station    The lettering used in the National Rail logotype is a modified form of the typeface Sassoon Bold  Some train operating companies continue to use the former British Rail Rail Alphabet lettering to varying degrees in station signage  although its use is no longer universal  however it remains compulsory  under Railway Group Standards  for safety signage in trackside areas and is still common  although not universal  on rolling stock   It is a common misconception that Rail Alphabet was also used for printed material  but with the exception of logos   British Rail   etc   this has never been the case  The British Rail typefaces of choice from 1965 were Helvetica and Univers  with others  particularly Frutiger  coming into use during the sectorisation period after 1983  TOCs may use what they like  examples include Futura  Stagecoach Group   Helvetica  FirstGroup and National Express   Frutiger  Arriva Trains Wales   Bliss  CrossCountry  an Arriva franchise but not branded as such   and a modified version of Precious by London Midland   Although TOCs compete against each other for franchises  and for passengers on routes where more than one TOC operates  the strapline used with the National Rail logo is  Britain s train companies working together    4  Other passenger rail operators in Great Britain  Several conurbations have their own metro or tram systems  most of which are not part of National Rail  These include the London Underground  Docklands Light Railway  Blackpool Tramway  London Tramlink  Glasgow Subway  Tyne and Wear Metro  Manchester Metrolink  Sheffield Supertram  Midland Metro and Nottingham Express Transit  On the other hand  the largely self contained Merseyrail system is part of the National Rail network  and urban rail networks around Birmingham  Cardiff  Glasgow and West Yorkshire consist entirely of National Rail services   London Overground  LO  is a hybrid  its services are operated via a concession awarded by Transport for London  and are branded accordingly  but until 2010 all its routes used infrastructure owned by Network Rail  LO now also possesses some infrastructure in its own right  following the reopening of the former East London line of London Underground as the East London Railway of LO  Since all the previous LO routes were operated by National Rail franchise Silverlink until November 2007  they have continued to be shown in the National Rail timetable and are still considered to be a part of National Rail   Heathrow Express and Eurostar  part of SNCF  are also not part of the National Rail network despite sharing of stations and routes  Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect only   Northern Ireland Railways was never part of British Rail  which was always confined to Great Britain  and therefore is not part of the National Rail network   There are many privately owned or heritage railways in Great Britain which are not part of the National Rail network and mostly operate for heritage or pleasure purposes rather than as public transport   5  Ticketing  National Rail services have a common ticketing structure inherited from British Rail  Through tickets are available between any pair of stations on the network  and can be bought from any station ticket office  Most tickets are inter available between the services of all operators on routes appropriate to the journey being made  Operators on some routes offer operator specific tickets that are cheaper than the inter available ones   Through tickets involving Heathrow Express and London Underground are also available  Oyster pay as you go can be used on National Rail in Greater London from 2 January 2010   Passengers without a valid ticket boarding a train at a station where ticket buying facilities are available are required to pay the full Open Single or Return fare  On some services penalty fares apply   a ticketless passenger may be charged the greater of £20 or twice the full single fare to the next stop  Penalty Fares can be collected only by authorised Revenue Protection Inspectors  not by ordinary Guards   National Rail distributes a number of technical manuals on which travel on the railways in Great Britain is based  such as the National Rail Conditions of Carriage  via their website   6  Timetables and websites  Pocket timetables for individual operators or routes are available free at staffed stations  A complete National Rail Timetable with up to 3 000 pages was also available for purchase  but the last hard copy edition was published in May 2007  Complete timetables are still available in printed form from TSO  The Stationery Office  and also an independent publisher   A digital version of the full timetable is available as a pdf  portable document format  file without charge on the Network Rail website  The National Rail Enquiries website  run by ATOC  includes a real time journey planner  fares and live departure information   7  See also  Rail Accident Investigation Branch  Rail transport in the United Kingdom  Disabled Persons Railcard  8  References  9  External links  – official
