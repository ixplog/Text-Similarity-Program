Richard Errett Smalley  June 6  1943 – October 28  2005  was the Gene and Norman Hackerman Professor of Chemistry and a Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University  in Houston  Texas  In 1996  along with Robert Curl  also a professor of chemistry at Rice  and Harold Kroto  a professor at the University of Sussex  he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of a new form of carbon  buckminsterfullerene   buckyballs    and was a leading advocate of nanotechnology and its many applications  including its use in creating strong but lightweight materials as well as its potential to fight cancer   1  Early life  Smalley  the youngest of 4 siblings  was born in Akron  Ohio  and grew up in Kansas City  Missouri   Smalley attended Hope College before transferring to the University of Michigan where he received his B S  in 1965  Between his studies  he worked in industry  where he developed his unique managerial style  He received his Ph D  from Princeton University in 1973 with Prof  E  R  Bernstein  He completed postdoctoral work at the University of Chicago  with Lennard Wharton and Donald Levy  where he was a pioneer in the development of supersonic beam laser spectroscopy   2  Fullerenes and nanotechnology  Smalley s research in physical chemistry investigated formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time of flight mass spectrometry  As a consequence of this expertise  Robert Curl introduced him to Harry Kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of astronomical dust  These are carbon rich grains expelled by old stars such as R Coronae Borealis  The result of this collaboration was the discovery of C60 and the fullerenes as the third allotropic form of carbon   The research that earned Kroto  Smalley and Curl the Nobel Prize mostly comprised three articles  First was the discovery of C60 in the Nov  14  1985  issue of Nature  C60  Buckminsterfullerene   The second article detailed the discovery of the endohedral fullerenes in  Lanthanum Complexes of Spheroidal Carbon Shells  in the Journal of the American Chemical Society v  107 p 7779  1985   The third announced the discovery of the fullerenes in  Reactivity of Large Carbon Clusters  Spheroidal Carbon Shells and Their Possible Relevance to the Formation and Morphology of Soot  in the Journal of Physical Chemistry v  90 p 525  1986    Although only three people can be cited for a Nobel Prize  graduate students James R  Heath  Yuan Liu  and Sean C  O Brien participated in the work  Smalley mentioned Heath and O Brien in his Nobel Lecture  Heath went on to become a professor at Caltech and O Brien joined Texas Instruments and is now at MEMtronics  Yuan Liu is a Senior Staff Scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory   Following nearly a decade s worth of research into the formation of alternate fullerene compounds  e g  C28  C70   as well as the synthesis of endohedral metallofullerenes  M@C60   reports of the identification of carbon nanotube structures led Smalley to begin investigating the iron catalyzed synthesis of carbon nanotubes   As a consequence of these researches  Smalley was able to persuade the administration of Rice University under then president Malcolm Gillis to create the Rice Center for Nanoscience and Technology  CNST   focusing on any aspect of molecular nanotechnology   Smalley s latest research was focused on carbon nanotubes  specifically focusing on the chemical synthesis side of nanotube research  He is well known for his group s invention of the high pressure carbon monoxide  HiPco  method of producing large batches of high quality nanotubes  Smalley spun off his work into a company  Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc  and associated nanotechnologies   2 1  Dispute on molecular assemblers  He was an outspoken critic of the idea of molecular assemblers  as advocated by K  Eric Drexler and introduced scientific objections to them  His two main objections  which he had termed the “fat fingers problem  and the  sticky fingers problem”  argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms  He also believed that Drexler’s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology  He debated Drexler in an exchange of letters which were published in Chemical & Engineering News as a point counterpoint feature   3  Later life  In 1999 Smalley was diagnosed with non Hodgkin s lymphoma  which later became chronic lymphocytic leukemia   In his later years  Smalley was very outspoken about the need for cheap  clean energy  which he described as the number one problem facing humanity in the 21st century  He felt that improved science education was key  and went to great lengths to encourage young students to consider careers in science  His slogan for this effort was  Be a scientist  save the world    Skeptical of religion in general for most of his life  Smalley became a Christian shortly before his death   See the Wikiquote for his personal statement in May 2005    In some of his later presentations  he presented a list entitled  Top Ten Problems of Humanity for Next 50 Years   His list in order of priority is   Energy  Water  Food  Environment  Poverty  Terrorism & war  Disease  Education  Democracy  Population Compare to Ten Threats formulated by the U N  s High Level Threat Panel in 2004   Smalley died of leukemia on October 28  2005  at M D  Anderson Cancer Center in Houston  Texas  at the age of 62  Upon his death  the US Senate passed a resolution to honor Smalley  crediting him as the “Father of Nanotechnology ”  4  Creationism  Smalley believed in Old Earth creationism  which accepts that the Earth is billions of years old    Recently I have gone back to church regularly with a new focus to understand as best I can what it is that makes Christianity so vital and powerful in the lives of billions of people today  even though almost 2000 years have passed since the death and resurrection of Christ  Although I suspect I will never fully understand  I now think the answer is very simple  it’s true  God did create the universe about 13 7 billion years ago  and of necessity has involved Himself with His creation ever since  The purpose of this universe is something that only God knows for sure  but it is increasingly clear to modern science that the universe was exquisitely fine tuned to enable human life  We are somehow critically involved in His purpose  Our job is to sense that purpose as best we can  love one another  and help Him get that job done ”  Following his death  Reasons To Believe  the publishers of the Old Earth creationism book  Who Was Adam   issued a news release that said   Evolution has just been dealt its death blow  After reading ‘Origins of Life’  with my background in chemistry and physics  it is clear evolution could not have occurred  The new book  ‘Who Was Adam ’  is the silver bullet that puts the evolutionary model to death ” At the Tuskegee University s 79th Annual Scholarship Convocation Parents  Recognition Program he made the following statement regarding the subject of evolution while urging his audience to take seriously their role as the higher species on this planet  “The burden of proof is on those who don t believe that  Genesis  was right  and there was a creation  and that Creator is still involved  We are the only species that can destroy the Earth or take care of it and nurture all that live on this very special planet  I m urging you to look on these things  For whatever reason  this planet was built specifically for us  Working on this planet is an absolute moral code      Let s go out and do what we were put on Earth to do   Old Earth creationist and astronomer Hugh Ross spoke at Smalley s funeral  November 2  2005   5  Publications  Smalley  R
