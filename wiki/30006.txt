Glenn  of the Bureau s Behavioral Science Unit  He assigns her to interview Hannibal Lecter  a former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer  whose insight might prove useful in the pursuit of a serial killer nicknamed  Buffalo Bill   who skins his female victims  corpses   Starling travels to the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane  where she is led by Frederick Chilton  Anthony Heald  to Lecter s solitary quarters  Although initially pleasant and courteous  Lecter grows impatient with Starling s attempts at  dissecting  him and rebuffs her  As she is leaving  one of the prisoners flicks semen at her  Lecter  who considers this act  unspeakably ugly   calls Starling back and tells her to seek out an old patient of his  This leads her to a storage shed where she discovers a man s severed head with a sphinx moth lodged in its throat  She returns to Lecter  who tells her that the man is linked to Buffalo Bill  He offers to profile Buffalo Bill on the condition that he be transferred away from Chilton  whom he detests   Buffalo Bill abducts a U S  Senator s daughter  Catherine Martin  Brooke Smith   Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps them find Buffalo Bill and rescue Catherine  Instead  Lecter demands a quid pro quo from Starling  offering clues about Buffalo Bill in exchange for personal information  Starling tells Lecter about the murder of her father when she was ten years old  Chilton secretly records the conversation and reveals Starling s deceit before offering Lecter a deal of Chilton s own making  Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis  Tennessee  where he verbally torments Senator Ruth Martin  Diane Baker  and gives her misleading information on Buffalo Bill including the name  Louis Friend    Starling notices that  Louis Friend  is an anagram of  iron sulfide â€”fool s gold  She visits Lecter  who is now being held in a cage like cell in a Tennessee courthouse  and asks for the truth  Lecter tells her that all the information she needs is contained in the case file  Rather than give her the real name  he insists that they continue their quid pro quo and she recounts a traumatic childhood incident where she was woken by the sound of spring lambs being slaughtered on a relative s farm in Montana  Starling admits that she still sometimes wakes thinking she can hear lambs screaming  and Lecter speculates that she is motivated to save Catherine in the hope that it will end the nightmares  Lecter gives her back the case files on Buffalo Bill after their conversation is interrupted by Chilton and the police who escort her from the building  Later that evening  Lecter kills his guards  escapes from his cell and disappears   Starling analyzes Lecter s annotations to the case files and realizes that Buffalo Bill knew his first victim personally  Starling travels to the victim s hometown and discovers that Buffalo Bill was a tailor  with dresses and dress patterns identical to the patches of skin removed from each of his victims  She telephones Crawford to inform him that Buffalo Bill is trying to fashion a  woman suit  of real skin  but Crawford is already en route to make an arrest  having cross referenced Lecter s notes with hospital archives and finding a man named Jame Gumb  who once applied unsuccessfully for a sex change operation  Starling continues interviewing friends of Buffalo Bill s first victim in Ohio while Crawford leads an F B I  tactical team to Gumb s address in Illinois  The house in Illinois is empty  and Starling is led to the house of  Jack Gordon   who she realizes is actually Jame Gumb  again by finding a sphinx moth  She pursues him into his multi room basement  where she discovers that Catherine is still alive  but trapped in a dry well  After turning off the basement lights  Gumb stalks Starling in the dark with night vision goggles but gives his position away when he cocks his revolver  Starling turns around just in time and kills him  firing the whole magazine of her pistol onto him   Some time later at her FBI Academy graduation party  Starling receives a phone call from Lecter  who is at an airport in Bimini  He assures her that he does not plan to pursue her and asks her to return the favor  which she says she cannot do  Lecter then hangs up the phone  saying that he is  having an old friend for dinner  and starts following a newly arrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd   2  Cast  Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling

to feature the character Hannibal Lecter following the 1986 film Manhunter  Prior to the novel s release  Orion Pictures partnered with Gene Hackman to bring the novel to the big screen  With Hackman set to direct and possibly star in the role of Lecter  negotiations were made to split the $500 000 cost of rights between Hackman and the studio  In addition to securing the rights to the novel  producers also had to acquire the rights to the name  Hannibal Lecter   which were owned by Manhunter producer Dino De Laurentiis  Owing to the financial failure of the earlier film  De Laurentiis lent the character rights to Orion Pictures for free   In November 1987  Ted Tally was brought on to write the adaptation  Tally had previously crossed paths with Harris many times  with his interest in adapting The Silence of the Lambs originating from receiving an advanced copy of the book from Harris himself  When Tally was about halfway through with the first draft  Hackman withdrew from the project and financing fell through  However  Orion Pictures co founder Mike Medavoy assured Tally to keep writing as the studio itself took care of financing and searched for a replacement director  As a result  Orion Pictures sought director Jonathan Demme to helm the project  With the screenplay not yet completed  Demme signed on after reading the novel  From there  the project quickly took off  as Tally explained    Demme  read my first draft not long after it was finished  and we met  then I was just startled by the speed of things  We met in May 1989 and were shooting in November  I don t remember any big revisions    3 2  Casting  Jodie Foster was interested in playing the role of Clarice Starling immediately after reading the novel  However  despite Foster having just won an Academy Award for her performance in the 1988 film The Accused  Demme was not convinced that she was right for the part  Having previously collaborated on Married to the Mob  Demme s first choice for the role of Starling was Michelle Pfeiffer  who turned it down  later saying   It was a difficult decision  but I got nervous about the subject matter   As a result  Foster was awarded the role due to her passion towards the character   For the role of Dr  Hannibal Lecter  Demme originally approached Sean Connery  After the actor turned it down  Anthony Hopkins was then offered the part based on his performance in The Elephant Man  Other actors considered for the role included Derek Jacobi and Daniel Day Lewis   Scott Glenn was cast in the role of Jack Crawford  the Agent in Charge of the Behavioral Science Unit of the FBI in Quantico  Virginia  To prepare for the role  Glenn met with John E  Douglas  whom the character is modeled after  Douglas gave Glenn a tour of the Quantico facility and also played for him an audio tape containing various recordings that serial killers Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris had made of themselves raping and torturing a 16 year old girl  According to Douglas  Glenn wept as he experienced the recordings and even changed his liberal stance on the death penalty   3 3  Filming  Principal photography for The Silence of the Lambs began on November 15  1989 and concluded on March 1  1990  Filming primarily took place in and around Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  with some scenes shot in nearby northern West Virginia  The exterior of the Western Center near Canonsburg  Pennsylvania served as the setting for Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane  In what was a rare act of cooperation at the time  the FBI allowed scenes to be filmed at the FBI Academy in Quantico  some FBI staff members even acted in bit parts   3 4  Music  The musical score for The Silence of the Lambs was composed by Howard Shore  who would also go on to collaborate with Demme on Philadelphia  Recorded in Munich during the latter half of the summer of 1990  the score was performed by the Munich Symphony Orchestra   I tried to write in a way that goes right into the fabric of the movie   explained Shore on his approach   I tried to make the music just fit in  When you watch the movie you are not aware of the music  You get your feelings from all elements simultaneously  lighting  cinematography  costumes  acting  music  Jonathan Demme was very specific about the music    The tune played by the music box which Starling finds in the bedroom of Buffalo Bill s first victim is taken from Mozart s opera The Magic Flute  It is  ironically  the tune played by Papageno s magical bells  which charms his enemies and protects him from danger   A soundtrack album was released by MCA Records on February 5  1991  Music from the film was later used in the trailers for its sequel  Hannibal   4  Release  The Silence of the Lambs was released on February 14  1991  grossing $13 766 814 during its opening weekend  Surpassing its own budget after one week  the film proved to be a major box office success  At the time it closed on October 10  1991  the film grossed $130 742 922 domestically with a total worldwide gross of $272 742 922  The film was the fourth highest grossing film of 1991   4 1  Critical reception  The Silence of the Lambs was a sleeper hit that gradually gained widespread success and critical acclaim  Hopkins  Foster  and Levine garnered much acclaim for their performances  Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 94% of 69 film critics have given the film a positive review  with a rating average of 8 4 out of 10  The site s consensus reads   Director Jonathan Demme s smart  taut thriller teeters on the edge between psychological study and all out horror  and benefits greatly from stellar performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster   Metacritic  another review aggregator  assigned the film a weighted average score of 84 out of 100  based on 17 reviews from mainstream critics  indicating  universal acclaim    Roger Ebert  of the Chicago Sun Times  specifically mentioned the  terrifying qualities  of Hannibal Lecter  Ebert later added the film to his  Great Movies  list  recognizing the film as a  horror masterpiece  alongside such classics as Nosferatu  Psycho  and Halloween  However  the film is also notable for being one of two multi Academy Award winners  the other being Unforgiven  disapproved of by Ebert s colleague  Gene Siskel  Writing for the Chicago Tribune  Siskel said   Foster s character  who is appealing  is dwarfed by the monsters she is after  I d rather see her work on another case    4 2  Accolades  The film won the Big Five Academy Awards  Best

Buffalo Bill as bisexual and transsexual  In response to the critiques  Demme replied that Buffalo Bill  wasn t a gay character  He was a tormented man who hated himself and wished he was a woman because that would have made him as far away from himself as he possibly could be   Demme added that he  came to realize that there is a tremendous absence of positive gay characters in movies    In a 1992 interview with Playboy magazine  notable feminist and women s rights advocate Betty Friedan stated   I thought it was absolutely outrageous that The Silence of the Lambs won four Oscars        I m not saying that the movie shouldn t have been shown  I m not denying the movie was an artistic triumph  but it was about the evisceration  the skinning alive of women  That is what I find offensive  Not the Playboy centerfold    6  See also  List of films based on crime books  Silence  The Musical  an unauthorized parody musical adaptation of the film   7  References  8  External links  at Metro
