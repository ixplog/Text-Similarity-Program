Kipsigis describe their place of origin as To near Lake Baringo  The Kipsigis are a Nilotic  Nilo hamitic  people  They are the most populous sub group of the Kalenjin  a subdivision of Nilotes  who originated in the South Sudan region  Another Kalenjin sub group are the Tatonga people of Tanzania  In the 1700s  the two tribes migrated to the present day region of Shinyanga in western Tanzania  Later  the Kipsigis returned to Kericho and a smaller group moved south to Angata Barigoi near the Tanzanian border  By the 19th century  the Kipsigis were living in the Rift Valley province of Kenya  British rule forced the Kipsigis into the colonial market economy   2  Demographics  The Kipsigis inhabit the highlands of Kericho from Timboroa to Mara River in the south  and from Mau Escarpment in the west to Kebeneti  The Kipsigis also live in parts of Laikipia  Kitale  Nakuru  Narok  Trans Mara District  Eldoret and the Nandi Hills Bomet  3  Language  The mother tongue of the Kipsigis is

such as Joel Arap Kimeto  Paul Sang Temugo  Paul Subembe  Kipchamba Arap Tapotuk and the comedian  Bomori Araap Baikalyaang  are from the Kipsigis community  The Segechek are a smaller clan with a belief in luck  wisdom and wealth and secretiveness   6  Customs  As with some Bantu groups  the Kipsigis and other Nilotes in the Great Lakes region have  through interaction  adopted customs from Southern Cushitic groups  including the age set system of social organization  circumcision  and elements of vocabulary   6 1  Coming of age  Kipsigis men undergo circumcision at about 14 years of age  Afterwards  the boy lives in a menjo near a forest or away from the main community while they heal  During this period  Kipsigis males undergo three traditional ceremonies called the kelab eun  the tyenjinet and the kayaet  After the first ritual  the boys are allowed to venture out into the forest for hunting using bows and wood made arrows  It is at this point in time that they master the use of the weapons of traditional warfare   6 2  Marriage  Traditionally  marriage is an important custom in Kipsigis society  The belief that the reincarnated spirit enters the newborn means having a family is desired  Secondly  a legitimate male heir is needed to inherit property  livestock    6 2 1  Exogamy  Marriage is strictly exogamous  no male may marry a woman of his clan or totem  Descendants of a woman may marry after the third generation  Exogamy extends to the family of the man and woman assigned to care for teenage initiates  boys and girls   It also extends through generations  One may not marry the children of a man of the same generation   6 2 2  Arrangement and ceremony  Girls are available for marriage as soon as their initiation is complete  The betrothal ceremony of girls before their initiation is the same as the actual wedding ceremony  Men may marriage at any age  A marriage is arranged through a number of visits of the groom s father to the family of the girl he chooses  A dowry of cattle is promised  The itself ceremony may take up to three hours   6 2 3  Polygamy and other marriage states  Polygamy is practiced with certain restrictions  A widow may become the partner of her husband s brother  A childless elderly widow may  wed  a young woman for support   7  Community organisation  A kokwet  a word derived from kok  a man s sitting place  is used to signify the neighborhood or primary community of 20 to 40 interrelated homesteads  Adult brothers tend to establish homesteads in different areas   7 1  Connection through marriage  Thus  the ortinwek  exogamous groups  are dispersed and intermingled  On the other hand  marriages tend to be between geographically nearby families  Neighbourhoods become small networks of direct and indirect affinal  connected by marriage  relationships together with a few further connections of direct agnation  relationship through the male side of the family  or common clan membership   7 2  Connection through locality  Strictly speaking  kokwet refers to the occasional gatherings of homestead heads and junior men to  for instance  make group decisions  settle local disputes  reprimand wrong doers or celebrate communal work harvests  Kokwet meetings are held some distance from any particular homestead yard  The meetings are open and are attended by men interested in the matter at hand  Whether the issue arises from domestic problems or breaches of the norms of public conduct  individual interests are expressed in terms of kinship  Senior men represent themselves at most meetings and dominate discussion  Younger men may need to attend because of family connections or with friends of their age group  Younger men speak only when their opinions or knowledge are solicited  Women and children may be called to kokwet meetings to give evidence but otherwise do not attend   7 3  Connection through geography  Streams and rivers hinder interaction and so there is a tendency for communities to develop on particular hillsides or areas of higher ground  However  communities are not ultimately defined by topographical features rather  they are marked by nodes or focal points  Place names may refer to a past event or a significant natural feature  The topographical areas that place names describe are not arranged hierarchically nor are they mutually exclusive  For example  koret  the area of a few communities and emet  the tribal region  are not prescribed by boundary lines   8  Kipsigis clans  Kaptirit  Kimeiteek  Kibasisek  Kibokwoek  Kapsengwerek  Kipkogosek
