White Zombie was a Grammy Award nominated American heavy metal band  Based in New York City  White Zombie was originally a noise rock band  White Zombie is better known for its later heavy metal oriented sound  The group officially disbanded in 1998  In 2000  White Zombie was included on VH1 s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock  ranking at No  56   1  History  1 1  Early years  White Zombie was co founded by writer  vocalist and graphic artist Rob Zombie  after coming up with the band idea in 1985 while attending Parsons School of Design in his junior year  Zombie s girlfriend at the time  Sean Yseult  was the other co founder  She had been playing the Farfisa keyboard in the band LIFE with Ivan de Prume  but the band soon broke up  Ena Kostabi owned a recording studio  which he would rent out to different bands  When he met Yseult  she asked if he could teach her to play bass  They then recruited Peter Landau to play drums and began to write and record songs  White Zombie s first release  Gods on Voodoo Moon  was an EP and was recorded on October 18  1985  It was released under the band s own label Silent Explosion  under which they would release most of their early work  Only 300 copies were pressed  of which only 100 were sold  the band members still retain possession of the remaining 200   In 1986  Zombie hired Tim Jeffs  his Parsons School of Design roommate  to play guitar to replace Ena Kostabi  and Yseult brought in De Prume from their days in the band LIFE as the replacement for Landau  It was at this time the band started touring  making their live performance debut at CBGB on April 28  1986  White Zombie released their second EP  Pig Heaven  that year  The release contained two songs   Pig Heaven  and  Slaughter the Grey   The EP was recorded at 6 8 Studios on Houston St and Bleecker St in NoHo in New York City  Other songs that were recorded during the session but never released were titled  Follow Wild    Rain Insane    Paradise Fireball  and  Red River Flow   After touring for a year in the band  Tim Jeffs left and was replaced by Tom Guay  often known as Tom Five  The band released a second pressing of Pig Heaven with different cover art  but retained the same recording with Jeffs on guitar  Only 500 copies of each pressing were released on vinyl   In 1987  the band released their third EP  Psycho Head Blowout  Later that year  the band released their first full length album  Soul Crusher  which was their first release to feature sound clips from movies in the songs  a trademark that would continue for the remainder of the band s lifespan  John Ricci replaced Tom Guay shortly after the release of Soul Crusher   In 1988  the band signed to Caroline Records  permanently discontinuing their old indie label  Their second album  Make Them Die Slowly  was released in February 1989  The album was a musical shift for White Zombie  While their previous releases had been strictly punk influenced noise rock  Make Them Die Slowly had more of a heavy metal sound  This is also the first album crediting  Rob Zombie  instead of his previous stage name   Rob  Dirt  Straker    Ricci s carpal tunnel syndrome severely affected his ability to play guitar  forcing him to leave the band when Make Them Die Slowly was finished  Jay Yuenger  or  J   replaced him before the album s release  affecting their future sound  One of the most obvious examples of this direction is the difference between the songs  Disaster Blaster  on Make Them Die Slowly and the re worked version   Disaster Blaster II   on the God of Thunder EP   1 2  Major label years  After searching for a record label and being turned down multiple times  the band turned towards RCA Records  However  Zombie opted for a recording contract with Geffen Records  Michael Alago  a representative of Geffen  became interested after hearing God of Thunder and watched one of their shows at Pyramid Club and liked them  mostly for their song  Soul Crusher   The band produced a demo with the help of J  G  Thirlwell of Foetus and were signed to Geffen   On March 17  1992  White Zombie released La Sexorcisto  Devil Music Volume One  the album which launched them into mainstream recognition  White Zombie began a two and a half year long tour for the album soon after its release  during which the band gained a large cult following  During the tour  Ivan de Prume left the band to pursue a successful career as a producer engineer as well as drummer percussionist and opened his own studio  Burningsound  He was replaced by Phil Buerstatte  The music video for the song  Thunder Kiss  65  went into heavy rotation on MTV in 1993  The popular TV show Beavis and Butt head began featuring their music videos  boosting the band s popularity  By the end of 1993  the album had been certified gold by the RIAA  By the time the tour ended in December 1994  Zombie and Yseult had broken up  and La Sexorcisto had gone platinum  Due to artistic differences  Buerstatte was let go  and John Tempesta  who had previously worked with Exodus and Testament  was hired to record White Zombie s second major label album  In 1995  Astro Creep  2000 was released  featuring the hit single  More Human than Human   In 1996  an album of remixes was released under the title Supersexy Swingin  Sounds  After making one last song for the 1996 film Beavis and Butt head Do America  titled  Ratfinks  Suicide Tanks and Cannibal Girls   White Zombie broke up in 1998   2  After disbanding  After the breakup of White Zombie  Sean Yseult joined the surf rock band The Famous Monsters  and started playing bass for horror themed New Orleans based band  Rock City Morgue  She also briefly played bass for The Cramps   Tempesta continued his musical relationship with Zombie  drumming for him on his first two solo albums  Hellbilly Deluxe and The Sinister Urge  He is no longer with Zombie  and has gone on to play for Scum of the Earth with his brother  Powerman 5000 guitarist Mike Tempesta  and ex Zombie guitarist Mike Riggs  Tempesta has toured with Testament  as shown on Testament s DVD  Live In London   On February 14  2006  he was hired as the new drummer for The Cult  before which  he played with Helmet   J  produced records for Fu Manchu and New York based Puny Human   In July 2006  original members Tom Five and de Prume reunited to perform with de Prume s band  Healer  a middle eastern infused metal band  for several concerts in Southern California for The Vans Warped Tour  De Prume continues to write and record music with Healer  as well as recording  producing and engineering for special projects in his studio  Burningsound  His drums and percussion work can also be heard on Sony s  Ghost Rider  score  In 2009  de Prume began hosting the weekly radio show   Metalopolis   His studio guests have included Rob Halford  Dave Mustaine  Max Cavalera  Vinnie Paul and Tom Araya  De Prume is also a member of the band KREEP  and has completed a West Coast tour in spring 2010  and is planning an East Coast tour in fall 2010   In November 2008  Geffen UME released Let Sleeping Corpses Lie  a boxed set which includes sixty four tracks featuring every White Zombie album and EP  except the remix albums   all remastered  The package also contained nine music videos  including their breakthrough Grammy nominated hit  Thunder Kiss  65    and ten live performances  In an interview to promote the release of Let Sleeping Corpses Lie  Zombie made it clear that a reunion with his White Zombie band mates was unlikely  saying   I don t want fans to think it s the beginning of anything    In December 2010 Yseult released  I m in the Band   a book containing tour diaries and photos as well as detailing her eleven years spent as a member of White Zombie   In June 2011  in an interview with Metal Hammer magazine  Rob Zombie was asked why White Zombie split up  in which he replied   It had run its course  Success is a big thing that you can never plan for  because it affects everybody differently  I don t want to blame myself or anyone else in the band — it s just that the band didn t work anymore  Rather than continuing on and making shitty records and having it all fall apart  I thought   Let s just end it on a high point     In May 2013  former drummer Phil Buerstatte died   3  Band members   Final lineup  Rob Zombie
