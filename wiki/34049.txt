A wart is a small  rough growth resembling a cauliflower or a solid blister  It typically occurs on humans  hands or feet but often in other locations  Warts are caused by a viral infection  specifically by one of the many types of human papillomavirus  HPV   There are as many as 10 varieties of warts  the most common considered to be mostly harmless  It is possible to get warts from others  they are contagious and usually enter the body in an area of broken skin  They typically disappear after a few months but can last for years and can recur   1  Types  A range of types of wart have been identified  varying in shape and site affected  as well as the type of human papillomavirus involved  These include   Common wart  Verruca vulgaris   a raised wart with roughened surface  most common on hands  but can grow anywhere on the body   Flat wart  Verruca plana   a small  smooth flattened wart  flesh coloured  which can occur in large numbers  most common on the face  neck  hands  wrists and knees   Filiform or digitate wart  a thread  or finger like wart  most common on the face  especially near the eyelids and lips   Genital wart  venereal wart  Condyloma acuminatum  Verruca acuminata   a wart that occurs on the genitalia   Mosaic wart  a group of tightly clustered plantar type warts  commonly on the hands or soles of the feet   Periungual wart  a cauliflower like cluster of warts that occurs around the nails   Plantar wart  verruca  Verruca plantaris   a hard sometimes painful lump  often with multiple black specks in the center  usually only found on pressure points on the soles of the feet   2  Cause  Warts are caused by the human papilloma virus  HPV   There are about 130 known types of human papilloma viruses  HPV infects the squamous epithelium  usually of the skin or genitals  but each HPV type is typically only able to infect a few specific areas on the body  Many HPV types can produce a benign growth  often called a  wart  or  papilloma   in the area they infect  Many of the more common HPV and wart types are listed below   Common warts – HPV types 2 and 4  most common   also types 1  3  26  29  and 57 and others   Cancers and genital dysplasia –  high risk  HPV types are associated with cancers  notably cervical cancer  and can also cause some vulvar  vaginal  penile  anal and some oropharyngeal cancers   low risk  types are associated with warts or other conditions    Plantar warts  myrmecia  – HPV type 1  most common   also types 2  3  4  27  28  and 58 and others   Anogenital warts  condylomata acuminata or venereal warts  – HPV types 6 and 11  most common   also types 42  44 and others   Flat warts – HPV types 3  10  and 28   Butcher s warts – HPV type 7   Heck s disease  Focal epithelial hyperplasia  – HPV types 13 and 32   3  Pathophysiology  Common warts have a characteristic appearance under the microscope  They have thickening of the stratum corneum  hyperkeratosis   thickening of the stratum spinosum  acanthosis   thickening of the stratum granulosum  rete ridge elongation  and large blood vessels at the dermoepidermal junction   4  Prevention  Gardasil is an HPV vaccine aimed at preventing cervical cancers and genital warts  Gardasil is designed to prevent infection with HPV types 16  18  6  and 11  HPV types 16 and 18 currently cause about 70% of cervical cancer cases  and also cause some vulvar  vaginal  penile and anal cancers  HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for 90% of documented cases of genital warts  Unfortunately the HPV vaccines do not currently prevent the virus strain responsible for verrucas  plantar warts    5  Treatment  There are many treatments and procedures associated with wart removal  A review of clinical trials of various cutaneous wart treatments concluded that topical treatments containing salicylic acid were more effective than placebo  Cryotherapy appears to be as effective as salicylic acid  but there have been fewer trials   One complicating factor in the treatment of warts is that the wart may regrow after it has been removed   5 1  Medication  Salicylic acid can be prescribed by a dermatologist in a higher concentration than that found in over the counter products  There are several over the counter options  readily available at pharmacies and supermarkets  There are typically two types of products  adhesive pads treated with salicylic acid or a bottle of concentrated salicylic acid solution   Imiquimod  a topical cream that helps the body s immune system fight the wart virus by encouraging interferon production  Approved by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  for genital warts  The drug is very expensive   Cantharidin  a chemical found naturally in many members of the beetle family Meloidae which causes dermal blistering  Either used by itself or compounded with podophyllin  Not FDA approved  but available through Canada or select US compounding pharmacies   Bleomycin  not US FDA approved  One or two injections used  It can cause necrosis of digits and Raynaud syndrome   Dinitrochlorobenzene  DNCB   like salicylic acid  is applied directly to the wart  Studies showed this method was effective with a cure rate of 80%  But DNCB must be used much more cautiously than salicylic acid  the chemical is known to cause genetic mutations  so it must be administered by a physician  This drug induces an allergic immune response resulting in inflammation that wards off the wart causing virus   Fluorouracil  which inhibits DNA synthesis  is being used as an experimental treatment  It is applied directly to the wart  especially plantar warts  and covered  for example  with tape   This treatment is combined with the use of a pumice stone  but tends to work very slowly  Another product available over the counter that can aid in wart removal is silver nitrate in the form of a caustic pencil  which is also available at drug stores  In a placebo controlled study of 70 patients  silver nitrate given over nine days resulted in clearance of all warts in 43% and improvement in warts in 26% one month after treatment compared to 11% and 14%  respectively  in the placebo group  The instructions must be followed to minimize staining of skin and clothing  Occasionally pigmented scars may develop   Cryosurgery or cryotherapy devices using a dimethyl ether – propane mixture are inexpensive  A disadvantage is that the sponge applicator is too large for small warts  and the temperature achieved is not nearly as low as with liquid nitrogen  Complications include blistering of normal skin if excess freezing is not controlled   Several randomized  controlled trials have found that zinc sulfate  consumed orally  often reduces or eliminates warts  The zinc sulfate dosage used in medical trials for treatment of warts was between 5 and 10 mg kg day  For elemental zinc  a lower dosage of 2 5 mg kg day may be appropriate as large amounts of zinc may cause a copper deficiency  Other trials have found that topical zinc sulfate solution or zinc oxide are also effective   5 2  Procedures  Keratolysis  of dead surface skin cells usually using salicylic acid  blistering agents  immune system modifiers   immunomodulators    or formaldehyde  often with mechanical paring of the wart with a pumice stone  blade etc   Electrodesiccation  Cryosurgery  which involves freezing the wart  generally with liquid nitrogen   creating a blister between the wart and epidermal layer after which the wart and the surrounding dead skin fall off by themselves  An average of 3 to 4 treatments are required for warts on thin skin  Warts on calloused skin like plantar warts might take dozens or more treatments   Surgical curettage of the wart   Laser treatment – often with a pulse dye laser or carbon dioxide  CO2  laser  Pulse dye lasers  wavelength 582 nm  work by selective absorption by blood cells  specifically haemoglobin   CO2 lasers work by selective absorption by water molecules  Pulse dye lasers are less destructive and more likely to heal without scarring  CO2 laser works by vaporizing and destroying tissue and skin  Laser treatments can be painful  expensive  though covered by many insurances   and not extensively scarring when used appropriately  CO2 lasers will require local anaesthetic  Pulse dye laser treatment does not need conscious sedation or local anesthetic  It takes 2 to 4 treatments but can be many more for extreme cases  Typically  10–14 days are required between treatments  Preventative measures are important   Infrared coagulator – an intense source of infrared light in a small beam like a laser  This works essentially on the same principle as laser treatment  It is less expensive  Like the laser  it can cause blistering pain and scarring   Duct tape occlusion therapy involves placing a piece of duct tape over the wart  The mechanism of action of this technique was unknown as of 2012  and despite several clinical trials the evidence for the efficacy of duct tape therapy is inconclusive  Despite the mixed evidence for efficacy  the simplicity of the method and its limited side effects leads some researchers to be reluctant to dismiss it   6  Folk remedies  A variety of traditional folk remedies and rituals claim to be able to remove warts   The acrid yellow sap of Greater Celandine is used as a traditional wart remedy  The sap can be applied directly to the wart in a similar manner to concentrated salicylic acid solution  but in more modest quantities   In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer  Mark Twain has his characters discuss a variety of such remedies  Tom Sawyer proposes  spunk water   or  stump water   the water collecting in the hollow of a tree stump  as a remedy for warts on the hand  You put your hand into the water at midnight and say   and then  walk away quick  eleven steps  with your eyes shut  and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody  Because if you speak the charm s busted   This is held to be superior to Huckleberry Finn s preferred remedy which involved throwing a dead cat into a graveyard  Another remedy involved splitting a bean  drawing blood from the wart and putting it on one of the halves  and burying that half at a crossroads at midnight  The theory of operation is that the blood on the buried bean will draw away the wart  Twain is recognized as an early collector and recorder of genuine American folklore   Similar practices are recorded elsewhere  In Louisiana  one remedy for warts involves rubbing the wart with a potato  which is then buried  when the  buried potato dries up  the wart will be cured   Another remedy similar to Twain s is reported from Northern Ireland  where water from a specific well on Rathlin Island is credited with the power to cure warts   A longstanding tradition holds that touching toads will cause warts  The most common Northern Hemisphere toads have glands that protrude from their skin that superficially resemble warts  Warts are caused by a virus  and toads do not harbor it   7  See also  List of cutaneous conditions  8  In other animals  9  References
