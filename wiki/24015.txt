Pope Benedict IX    c  1012 – c  1056   born Theophylactus of Tusculum in Rome  was Pope on three occasions between October 1032 and July 1048  Aged approximately 20 at his first election  he is one of the youngest popes in history  He is the only man to have been Pope on more than one occasion and the only man ever to have sold the papacy   1  Biography  Benedict was the son of Alberic III  Count of Tusculum  and was a nephew of Pope Benedict VIII and Pope John XIX  His father obtained the Papal chair for him  granting it to his son in October 1032   According to the Catholic Encyclopedia Benedict IX was about 20 when made pontiff  although other sources state 11 or 12  He reportedly led an extremely dissolute life and allegedly had few qualifications for the papacy other than connections with a socially powerful family  In terms of theology and the ordinary activities of the Church he was entirely orthodox  St  Peter Damian is alleged to have described him as  feasting on immorality   the anti papal historian Ferdinand Gregorovius wrote that in Benedict   It seemed as if a demon from hell  in the disguise of a priest  occupied the chair of Peter and profaned the sacred mysteries of religion by his insolent courses   The Catholic Encyclopedia calls him  a disgrace to the Chair of Peter   The first pope said to have been primarily homosexual  he was said to have held orgies in the Lateran palace   He was also accused by Bishop Benno of Piacenza of  many vile adulteries and murders   Pope Victor III  in his third book of Dialogues  referred to  his rapes  murders and other unspeakable acts  His life as a pope was so vile  so foul  so execrable  that I shudder to think of it    He was briefly forced out of Rome in 1036  but returned with the help of Emperor Conrad II   In September 1044 the opposition forced him out of the city again and elected John  Bishop of Sabina  as Pope Sylvester III  Benedict IX s forces returned in April 1045 and expelled his rival  who returned to his previous bishopric   Later in 1045  in order to rid the Church of the scandalous Benedict  his godfather  the pious priest John Gratian  persuaded Benedict to resign the papacy for a sum of money  thus allowing Gratian to become Pope Gregory VI  Some also say that Benedict wanted to marry   Benedict IX soon regretted his resignation and returned to Rome  taking the city and remaining on the throne until July 1046  although Gregory VI continued to be recognized as the true pope  At the time  Sylvester III also reasserted his claim   German King Henry III intervened  and at the Council of Sutri in December 1046  Benedict IX and Sylvester III were declared deposed while Gregory VI was encouraged to resign because the arrangement he had entered into with Benedict was considered simoniacal  that is  to have been paid for  The German Bishop Suidger was crowned as Gregory s successor  Pope Clement II   Benedict IX had not attended the council and did not accept his deposition  When Clement II died in October 1047  Benedict seized the Lateran Palace in November  but was driven away by German troops in July 1048  To fill the power vacuum  Bishop Poppo of Brixen was elected as Pope Damasus II and universally recognized as such  Benedict IX refused to appear on charges of simony in 1049 and was excommunicated   Benedict IX s eventual fate is obscure  but he seems to have given up his claims to the papal throne  Pope Leo IX may have lifted the ban on him  Benedict IX was buried in the Abbey of Grottaferrata c  1056  According to the abbot  he was penitent and turned away from his sins as pontiff   Benedict is usually recognized as having had three terms as pope   the first lasting from his election to his expulsion in favour of Sylvester III  October 1032 – September 1044   the second from his return to his selling the papacy to Gregory VI  April – May 1045   the third from his return after the death of Clement II to the advent of Damasus II  November 1047 – July 1048   2  Family tree  3  See also  List of sexually active popes  List of ages of popes  Liber Gomorrhianus  4  References  5  External links
