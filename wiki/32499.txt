Vector graphics is the use of geometrical primitives such as points  lines  curves  and shapes or polygons—all of which are based on mathematical expressions—to represent images in computer graphics  Vector graphics are based on vectors  also called paths   which lead through locations called control points or nodes  Each of these points has a definite position on the x and y axes of the work plane and determines the direction of the path  further  each path may be assigned a stroke color  shape  thickness  and fill  These properties don t increase the size of vector graphics files in a substantial manner  as all information resides in the document s structure  which describes solely how the vector should be drawn   The term vector graphics is typically used only for 2D  planar  graphics objects  in order to distinguish them from 2D raster graphics  which are also very common  3D graphics as commonly implemented today  e g  in OpenGL  are typically described using primitives like 3D points and polygons connecting these  which in turn describe surfaces   these 3D primitives are much more similar to vector graphics than to raster graphics  but aren t explicitly called vector graphics  The equivalent of raster graphics in the 3D world are voxel based graphics   Some authors have criticized the term vector graphics as being confusing  In particular  vector graphics does not simply refer to graphics described by Euclidean vectors  Some authors have proposed to use object oriented graphics instead  However this term can also be confusing as it can be read as any kind of graphics implemented using object oriented programming   1  Overview  2  Standards  2 1  Web  The World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  standard for vector graphics is Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG   The standard is complex and has been relatively slow to be established at least in part owing to commercial interests  Many web browsers now have some support for rendering SVG data but full implementations of the standard are still comparatively rare   In recent years  SVG has become a significant format that is completely independent of the resolution of the rendering device  typically a printer or display monitor  SVG files are essentially printable text that describes both straight and curved paths  as well as other attributes  Wikipedia prefers SVG for images such as simple maps  line illustrations  coats of arms  and flags  which generally are not like photographs or other continuous tone images  Rendering SVG requires conversion to raster format at a resolution appropriate for the current task  SVG is also a format for animated graphics   There is also a version of SVG for mobile phones  In particular  the specific format for mobile phones is called SVGT  SVG Tiny version   These images can count links and also exploit anti aliasing  They can also be displayed as wallpaper   3  Applications  The earliest 2D computer graphics were all vector graphics   One of the first uses of vector graphic displays was the US SAGE air defense system  Vector graphics systems were only retired from U S  en route air traffic control in 1999  and are likely still in use in military and specialised systems  Vector graphics were also used on the TX 2 at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory by computer graphics pioneer Ivan Sutherland to run his program Sketchpad in 1963   Subsequent vector graphics systems  most of which iterated through dynamically modifiable stored lists of drawing instructions  include the IBM 2250  Imlac PDS 1  and DEC GT40  There was a home gaming system that used vector graphics called Vectrex as well as various arcade games like Asteroids   Space Wars and many cinematronics titles such as  rip off    tail gunner    Armor Attack  and  Boxing Bugs  using vector monitors  Storage scope displays  such as the Tektronix 4014  could display vector images but not modify them without first erasing the display   In computer typography  modern outline fonts describe printable characters  glyphs  by cubic or quadratic mathematical curves with control points  Nevertheless  bitmap fonts are still in use  Converting outlines requires filling them in  converting to bitmaps is not trivial  because bitmaps often don t have sufficient resolution to avoid  stairstepping    aliasing    especially with smaller visible character sizes  Processing outline character data in sophisticated fashion to create satisfactory bitmaps for rendering is called  hinting   Although the term implies suggestion  the process is deterministic  and done by executable code  essentially a special purpose computer language  While automatic hinting is possible  results can be inferior to that done by experts   Modern vector graphics displays can sometimes be found at laser light shows  where two fast moving X Y mirrors position the beam to rapidly draw shapes and text as straight and curved strokes on a screen   Vector graphics can be created in form using a pen plotter  a special type of printer that uses a series of ballpoint and felt tip pens on a servo driven mount that moves horizontally across the paper  with the plotter moving the paper back and forth through its paper path for vertical movement  Although a typical plot might easily require a few thousand paper motions  back and forth  the paper doesn t slip  In a tiny roll fed plotter made by Alps in Japan  teeth on thin sprockets indented the paper near its edges on the first pass  and maintained registration on subsequent passes   Some Hewlett Packard pen plotters had two axis pen carriers and stationery paper  plot size was limited   However  the moving paper H P plotters had grit wheels  akin to machine shop grinding wheels  which  on the first pass  indented the paper surface  and collectively maintained registration   Present day vector graphic files such as engineering drawings are typically printed as bitmaps  after vector to raster conversion   The term  vector graphics  is mainly used today in the context of two dimensional computer graphics  It is one of several modes an artist can use to create an image on a raster display  Other modes include text  multimedia  and 3D rendering  Virtually all modern 3D rendering is done using extensions of 2D vector graphics techniques  Plotters used in technical drawing still draw vectors directly to paper   4  Typical primitive objects  Any particular vector file format supports only some kinds of primitive objects  Nearly all vector file formats support simple and fast rendering primitive objects   Lines  polylines and polygons  Bézier curves and bezigons  Circles and ellipses Most vector file formats support  Text  in computer font formats such as TrueType where each letter is created from Bézier curves  or quadratics   color gradient  Often  a bitmap image is considered as a primitive object  From the conceptual view  it behaves as a rectangle  A few vector file formats support more complex objects as primitives   Many computer aided design applications support splines and other curves  such as   Catmull–Rom splines  NURBS  iterated function systems  superellipses and superellipsoids  metaballs  etc  If an image stored in one vector file format is converted to another file format that supports all the primitive objects used in that particular image  then the conversion can be lossless   5  Vector operations  Vector graphics editors typically allow rotation  movement  without rotation   mirroring  stretching  skewing  affine transformations  changing of z order  loosely  what s in front of what  and combination of primitives into more complex objects   More sophisticated transformations include set operations on closed shapes  union  difference  intersection  etc     Vector graphics are ideal for simple or composite drawings that need to be device independent  or do not need to achieve photo realism  For example  the PostScript and PDF page description languages use a vector graphics model   6  Compared to raster graphics  Advantages to this style of drawing over raster graphics   This minimal amount of information translates to a much smaller file size compared to large raster images  the size of representation does not depend on the dimensions of the object   though a vector graphic with a small file size is often said to lack detail compared with a real world photo   Correspondingly  one can infinitely zoom in on e g  a circle arc  and it remains smooth  On the other hand  a polygon representing a curve will reveal being not really curved   On zooming in  lines and curves need not get wider proportionally  Often the width is either not increased or less than proportional  On the other hand  irregular curves represented by simple geometric shapes may be made proportionally wider when zooming in  to keep them looking smooth and not like these geometric shapes   The parameters of objects are stored and can be later modified  This means that moving  scaling  rotating  filling etc  doesn t degrade the quality of a drawing  Moreover  it is usual to specify the dimensions in device independent units  which results in the best possible rasterization on raster devices   From a 3 D perspective  rendering shadows is also much more realistic with vector graphics  as shadows can be abstracted into the rays of light from which they are formed  This allows for photo realistic images and renderings  For example  consider a circle of radius r  The main pieces of information a program needs in order to draw this circle are  an indication that what is to be drawn is a circle  the radius r  the location of the center point of the circle  stroke line style and color  possibly transparent   fill style and color  possibly transparent  Vector formats are not always appropriate in graphics work and also have numerous disadvantages  For example  devices such as cameras and scanners produce essentially continuous tone raster graphics that are impractical to convert into vectors  and so for this type of work  an image editor will operate on the pixels rather than on drawing objects defined by mathematical expressions  Comprehensive graphics tools will combine images from vector and raster sources  and may provide editing tools for both  since some parts of an image could come from a camera source  and others could have been drawn using vector tools   7  Conversion  7 1  To raster  Modern displays and printers are raster devices  vector formats have to be converted to raster format  bitmaps – pixel arrays  before they can be rendered  displayed or printed   The size of the bitmap raster format file generated by the conversion will depend on the resolution required  but the size of the vector file generating the bitmap raster file will always remain the same  Thus  it is easy to convert from a vector file to a range of bitmap raster file formats but it is much more difficult to go in the opposite direction  especially if subsequent editing of the vector picture is required  It might be an advantage to save an image created from a vector source file as a bitmap raster format  because different systems have different  and incompatible  vector formats  and some might not support vector graphics at all  However  once a file is converted from the vector format  it is likely to be bigger  and it loses the advantage of scalability without loss of resolution  It will also no longer be possible to edit individual parts of the image as discrete objects  The file size of a vector graphic image depends on the number of graphic elements it contains  it is a list of descriptions   7 2  From raster  8  Printing  Vector art is ideal for printing since the art is made from a series of mathematical curves  it will print very crisply even when resized  For instance  one can print a vector logo on a small sheet of copy paper  and then enlarge the same vector logo to billboard size and keep the same crisp quality  A low resolution raster graphic would blur or pixelate excessively if it were enlarged from business card size to billboard size   The precise resolution of a raster graphic necessary for high quality results depends on the viewing distance  e g   a billboard may still appear to be of high quality even at low resolution if the viewing distance is great enough    If we regard typographic characters as images  then the same considerations that we have made for graphics apply even to composition of written text for printing  typesetting   Older character sets were stored as bitmaps  Therefore  to achieve maximum print quality they had to be used at a given resolution only  these font formats are said to be non scalable  High quality typography is nowadays based on character drawings  fonts  which are typically stored as vector graphics  and as such are scalable to any size  Examples of these vector formats for characters are Postscript fonts and TrueType fonts   9  3D modeling  In 3D computer graphics  vectorized surface representations are most common  bitmaps can be used for special purposes such as surface texturing  height field data and bump mapping   At the low end  simple meshes of polygons are used to represent geometric detail in applications where interactive frame rates or simplicity are important  At the high end  where one is willing to trade off higher rendering times for increased image quality and precision  smooth surface representations such as Bézier patches  NURBS or Subdivision surfaces are used  One can  however  achieve a smooth surface rendering from a polygonal mesh through the use of shading algorithms such as Phong and Gouraud   10  Formats  The list of proprietary and public vector formats is maintained
