A         is a story  dialogue  question  or statement  which is used in Zen practice to provoke the  great doubt  and test a student s progress in Zen practice   1  Etymology  The Japanese term kōan is the Sino Japanese reading of the Chinese word gong an     The term is a compound word  consisting of the characters 公  public  official  governmental  common  collective  fair  equitable  and 案  table  desk   law  case  record  file  plan  proposal    According to the Yuan Dynasty Zen master Zhongfeng Mingben  中峰明本 1263–1323   gōng àn originated as an abbreviation of gōngfǔ zhī àndú  公府之案牘  Japanese kōfu no antoku—literally the andu  official correspondence  documents  files  of a gongfu  government post    which referred to a  public record  or the  case records of a public law court  in Tang dynasty China  Kōan gong an thus serves as a metaphor for principles of reality beyond the private opinion of one person  and a teacher may test the student s ability to recognize and understand that principle   Commentaries in kōan collections bear some similarity to judicial decisions that cite and sometimes modify precedents  An article by T  Griffith Foulk claims  Gong an was itself originally a metaphor—an article of furniture that came to denote legal precedents  For example  Di Gong an  狄公案  is the original title of Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee  the famous Chinese detective novel based on a historical Tang dynasty judge  Similarly  Zen kōan collections are public records of the notable sayings and actions of Zen disciples and masters attempting to pass on their teachings   2  Origins and development  2 1  China  2 1 1  Commenting on old cases  Gongans developed during the Tang Dynasty  618–907  from the recorded sayings collections of Chán masters  which quoted many stories of  a famous past Chán figure s encounter with disciples or other interlocutors and then offering his own comment on it   Those stories and the accompanying comments were used to educate students  and broaden their insight into the Buddhist teachings   Those stories came to be known as gongan   public cases   Such a story was only considered a gongan when it was commented upon by another Chán master  This practice of commenting on the words and deeds of past masters confirmed the master s position as an awakened master in a lineage of awakened masters of the past   2 1 2  Literary practice  Koan practice developed from a literary practice  styling snippets of encounter dialogue into well edited stories  It arose in interaction with  educated literati   There were dangers involved in such a literary approach  such as fixing specific meanings to the cases  Dahui Zonggao is even said to have burned the woodblocks of the Blue Cliff Record  for the hindrance it had become to study of Chán by his students Kōan literature was also influenced by the pre Zen Chinese tradition of the  literary game —a competition involving improvised poetry   The style of writing of Zen texts has been influenced by  a variety of east Asian literary games    2 1 3  Observing the phrase  During the Song Dynasty  960–1297  the use of gongans took a decisive turn  Dahui Zonggao  1089–1163  introduced the use of k an hua   observing the phrase   In this practice students were to observe  k an  or concentrate on a single word or phrase  hua t ou   such as the famous mu of the mu koan   In the eleventh century this practice had become common  A new literary genre developed from this tradition as well  Collections of such commented cases were compiled which consisted of the case itself  accompanied by verse or prose commentary   Tahui s invention was aimed at balancing the insight developed by reflection on the teachings with developing samatha  calmness of mind  Ironically  this development became in effect silent illumination  a   re absorbing  of koan study into the  silence  of meditation  ch an    It led to a rejection of Buddhist learning   This development left Chinese Chán vulnerable to criticisms by neo Confucianism  which developed after the Sung Dynasty  Its anti intellectual rhetoric was no match for the intellectual discourse of the neo Confucianists   2 1 4  Interaction  The recorded encounter dialogues  and the koan collections which derived from this genre  mark a shift from solitary practice to interaction between master and student   This mutual enquiry of the meaning of the encounters of masters and students of the past gave students a role model   Kōan training requires a qualified teacher who has the ability to judge a disciple s depth of attainment  In the Rinzai Zen school  which uses kōans extensively  the teacher certification process includes an appraisal of proficiency in using that school s extensive kōan curriculum   2 1 5  Contemporary koan use  In China and Korea   observing the phrase  is still the sole form of koan practice  though Seung Sahn used the Rinzai style of koan practice in his Kwan Um School of Zen   2 2  Japan  Japanese Zen  both Rinzai and Soto  took over the use of koan study and  commenting  In Soto Zen  koan commentary was not linked to seated meditation   2 2 1  Koan manuals  When the Chán tradition was introduced in Japan Japanese monks had to master the Chinese language and specific expressions used in the koan training  The desired  spontaneity  expressed by enlightened masters required a thorough study of Chinese language and poetry  Japanese Zen imitated the Chinese  syntax and stereotyped norms    In the officially recognized monasteries belonging to the Gozan  Five Mountain System  the Chinese system was fully continued  Senior monks were supposed to compose Chinese verse in a complex style of matched counterpoints known as bien li wen  It took a lot of literary and intellectual skills for a monk to succeed in this system   The Rinka monasteries  the provincial temples with less control of the state  laid less stress on the correct command of the Chinese cultural idiom  These monasteries developed  more accessible methods of koan instruction   It had three features   A standardized koan curriculum   A standardized set of answers based on stereotypes Chinese sayings   A standardized method of secretly guiding students through the curriculum of koan and answers  By standardizing the koan curriculum every generation of students proceeded to the same series of koans  Students had to memorize a set number of stereotyped sayings  agyo   appended words   The proper series of responses for each koan were taught by the master in private instruction sessions to selected individual students who would inherit the dharma lineage   Missanroku and missancho   Records of secret instruction  have been preserved for various Rinzai lineages  They contain both the koan curricula and the standardized answers  In Soto Zen they are called monsan  an abbreviation of monto hissan   secret instructions of the lineage   The monsan follow a standard question and answer format  A series of questions is given  to be asked by the master  The answers are also given by the master  to be memorized by the student   2 2 2  Contemporary koan curricula  In the eighteenth century the Rinzai school became dominated by the legacy of Hakuin  who laid a strong emphasis on koan study as a means to gain kensho and develop insight  There are two curricula used in Rinzai  both derived from the principal heirs of Rinzai  the Takuju curriculum  and the Inzan curriculum  According to AMA Samy   the koans and their standard answers are fixed    2 2 3  Suppression in the Soto school  During the late eighteenth and nineteenth century the tradition of koan commentary became suppressed in the Soto school  due to a reform movement that sought to standardise the procedures for dharma transmission  One reason for suppressing the koan tradition in the Soto school may have been to highlight the differences with the Rinzai school  and create a clear identity  This movement also started to venerate Dogen as the founding teacher of the Soto school  His teachings became the standard for the Soto teachings  neglecting the fact that Dogen himself made extensive use of koan commentary   3  Doctrinal background  The popular western understanding sees kōan as referring to an unanswerable question or a meaningless statement  However  in Zen practice  a kōan is not meaningless  and not a riddle or a puzzle  Teachers do expect students to present an appropriate response when asked about a kōan   Koans are also understood as pointers to an unmediated  Pure Consciousness   devoid of cognitive activity  Victor Hori criticizes this understanding   According to Hori  a central theme of many koans is the  identity of opposites    Comparable statements are   Look at the flower and the flower also looks    Guest and host interchange    4  Koan practice  Study of kōan literature is common to all schools of Zen  though with varying emphases and curriculae  The Rinzai school uses extensive koan curricula  checking questions  and jakogo   capping phrases   quotations from Chinese poetry  in its use of koans  The Sanbo Kyodan  and its western derivates of Taizan Maezumi and the White Plum Asanga  also use koan curricula  but have omitted the use of capping phrases  In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon  the emphasis is on Hua Tou  the study of one koan throughout one s lifetime  In Japanese Soto Zen  the use of koans has been abandoned since the late eighteenth and nineteenth century   4 1  Hua tou or breakthrough koan  In the Rinzai school  the Sanbo Kyodan  and the White Plum Asanga  koan practice starts with the assignment of a hosshi or  break through koan   usually the mu koan or  the sound of one hand clapping   In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon  various koan can be used for the hua tou practice   Students are instructed to concentrate on the  word head   like the phrase  mu   In the Wumenguan  Mumonkan   public case #1   Zhaozhou s Dog    Wumen  Mumon  wrote   Arousing this great inquiry or  Great Doubt  is an essential element of kōan practice  It builds up  strong internal pressure  gidan   never stopping knocking from within at the door of  the  mind  demanding to be resolved   To illustrate the enormous concentration required in kōan meditation  Zen Master Wumen commented   Analysing the koan for its literal meaning won t lead to insight  though understanding the context from which koans emerged can make them more intelligible  For example  when a monk asked Zhaozhou  Joshu   does a dog have Buddha nature or not    the monk was referring to the understanding of the teachings on Buddha nature  which were understood in the Chinese context of absolute and relative reality   4 2  Insight  The continuous pondering of the break through koan  shokan  or Hua Tou   word head   leads to kensho  an initial insight into  seeing the  Buddha  nature   The aim of the break through koan is to see the  nonduality of subject and object    Various accounts can be found which describe this  becoming one  and the resulting breakthrough   But the use of the mu koan has also been criticised  According to AMA Samy  the main aim is merely to   become one  with the koan   Showing to have  become one  with the first koan is enough to pass the first koan  According to Samy  this is not equal to prajna   4 3  Testing insight   or learning responses  4 3 1  Sassho – Checking questions  Teachers may probe students about their kōan practice using sassho   checking questions  to validate their satori  understanding  or kensho  seeing the nature   For the mu koan and the clapping hand koan there are twenty to a hundred checking questions  depending on the teaching lineage  The checking questions serve to deepen the insight of the student  but also to test his or her understanding   Those checking questions  and their answers  are part of a standardised set of questions and answers  Students are learning a  ritual performance   learning how to behave and response in specific ways  learning  clever repartees  ritualized language and gestures and be submissive to the master’s diktat and arbitration    4 3 2  Jakugo – Capping phrases  In the Rinzai school  passing a koan and the checking questions has to be supplemented by jakugo   capping phrases   citations of Chinese poetry to demonstrate the insight  Students can use collections of those citations  instead of composing poetry themselves   4 4  Post satori practice  After the initial insight further practice is necessary  to deepen the insight and learn to express it in daily life  In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon  this further practice consists of further pondering of the same Hua Tou  In Rinzai Zen  this further practice is undertaken by further koan study  for which elaborate curriculae exist  In Soto Zen  Shikantaza is the main practice for deepening insight   5  Varieties in koan practice  5 1  Chinese Chán and Korean Seon  In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon  the primary form of Koan study is k an hua   reflection on the koan   also called Hua Tou   word head   In this practice  a fragment of the koan  such as  mu   or a  what is  question is used by focusing on this fragment and repeating it over and over again   The student is assigned only one hua tou for a lifetime  In contrast to the similar sounding  who am I   question of Ramana Maharshi  hua tou involves raising  great doubt    5 2  Japanese Rinzai  Kōan practice is particularly important among Japanese practitioners of the Rinzai sect   5 2 1  Importance of koan study  This importance is reflected in writings in the Rinzai school on the koan genre  Zhongfeng Mingben  中峰明本  Wade Giles Chung feng Ming pen  Jpn  Chūhō Myōhon   1263–1323   a Chinese Chán master who lived at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty  revitalized the Rinzai tradition  and put a strong emphasis on the use of koans  He saw the kung ans as  work of literature  that  should be used as objective  universal standards to test the insight of monks who aspired to be recognized as Ch an masters    Musō Soseki  1275–1351   a Japanese contemporary of Zhongfeng Mingben  relativized the use of koans  The study of koans had become popular in Japan  due to the influence of Chinese masters such as Zhongfeng Mingben  Despite belonging to the Rinzai school  Musō Soseki also made extensive use of richi  teaching   explaining the sutras  instead of kikan  koan   According to Musō Soseki  both are upaya   skillfull means  meant to educate students  Musō Soseki called both shōkogyu   little jewels   tools to help the student to attain satori   5 2 2  Koan curricula  In Rinzai a gradual succession of koans is studied  There are two general branches of curricula used within Rinzai  derived from the principal heirs of Rinzai  the Takuju curriculum  and the Inzan curriculum  However  there are a number of sub branches of these  and additional variations of curriculum often exist between individual teaching lines which can reflect the recorded experiences of a particular lineage s members  Koan curricula are  in fact  subject to continued accretion and evolution over time  and thus are best considered living traditions of practice rather than set programs of study   Koan practice starts with the shokan  or  first barrier   usually the mu koan or the koan  What is the sound of one hand clapping   After having attained kensho  students continue their practice investigating subsequent koans  In the Takuju school  after breakthrough students work through the Gateless Gate  Mumonkan   the Blue Cliff Record  Hekigan roku   the Entangling Vines  Shumon Kattoshu   and the Collection of Wings of the Blackbird  Chin u shu   The Inzan school uses its own internally generated list of koans   Hakuin s descendants developed a fivefold classification system   Hosshin  dharma body koans  are used to awaken the first insight into sunyata  They reveal the dharmakaya  or Fundamental  They introduce  the undifferentitated and the unconditional    Kikan  dynamic action koans  help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view  Where hosshin koans represent tai  substance  kikan koans represent yu  function   Gonsen  explication of word koans  aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters  They show how the Fundamental  though not depending on words  is nevertheless expressd in words  without getting stuck to words   Hachi Nanto  eight  difficult to pass  koans  There are various explanations for this category  one being that these koans cut off clinging to the previous attainment  They create another Great Doubt  which shatters the self attained through satori  It is uncertain which are exactly those eight koans  Hori gives various sources  which altogether give ten hachi nanto koans   Miura and Sasaki   Nansen s Flower  Hekigan roku Case 40   A

fifth category was Kojo   Directed upwards   This category too was meant to rid the monk of any  stink of Zen   The very advanced practitioner may also receive the Matsugo no rokan   The last barrier  and Saigo no ikketsu   The final confirmation    The last barrier  when one left the training hall  for example  Sum up all of the records of Rinzai in one word   It is not meant to be solved immediately  but to be carried around in order to keep practising   the final confirmation  may be another word for the same kind of koan   5 2 3  Post satori practice  Completing the koan curriculum in the Rinzai schools traditionally also led to a mastery of Chinese poetry and literary skills   After completing the koan training  Gogo no shugyo  post satori training is necessary   5 2 4  Breathing practices  Hakuin Ekaku  the 17th century revitalizer of the Rinzai school  taught several practices which serve to correct physical and mental imbalances arising from  among other things  incorrect or excessive koan practice  The  soft butter  method  nanso no ho  and  introspection method   naikan no ho  involve cultivation of ki centered on the tanden  Chinese dantian   These practices are described in Hakuin s works Orategama and Yasen Kanna  and are still taught in some Rinzai lineages today   5 3  Japanese Soto  Though few Soto practitioners concentrate on kōans during meditation  the Soto sect has a strong historical connection with kōans  since many kōan collections were compiled by Soto priests   During the 13th century  Dōgen  founder of the Soto sect in Japan  quoted 580 kōans in his teachings  He compiled some 300 kōans in the volumes known as the Greater Shōbōgenzō  Dōgen wrote of Genjokōan  which points out that everyday life experience is the fundamental kōan   However  according to Michel Mohr   5 4  Sanbo Kyodan and White Plum Asanga  The Sanbo Kyodan school and the White Plum Asanga  which originated with the Soto priest Hakuun Yasutani  incorporates koan study  The Sanbo kyodan places great emphasis on kensho  initial insight into one s true nature  as a start of real practice  It follows the so called Harada Yasutani koan curriculum  which is derived from Hakuin s student Takuju  It is a shortened koan curriculum  in which the socalled  capping phrases  are removed  The curriculum takes considerably less time to study than the Takuju curriculum of Rinzai   To attain kensho  most students are assigned the mu koan  After breaking through  the student first studies twenty two  in house  koans  which are  unpublished and not for the general public   but are nevertheless published and commented upon  There after  the students goes through the Gateless Gate  Mumonkan   the Blue Cliff Record  the Book of Equanimity  and the Record of Transmitting the Light  The koan curriculum is completed by the Five ranks of Tozan and the precepts   6  Classical kōan collections  Kōans collectively form a substantial body of literature studied by Zen practitioners and scholars worldwide  Kōan collections commonly referenced in English include   The Blue Cliff Record  Chinese  Bìyán Lù  Japanese  Hekiganroku   12th century   The Book of Equanimity  also known as the Book of Serenity  Chinese  Cōngróng Lù  Japanese  Shoyoroku   12th century   The Gateless Gate  also known as The Gateless Barrier  Chinese  Wúménguān  Japanese  Mumonkan  collected during the 13th century   In these and subsequent collections  a terse  main case  of a kōan often accompanies prefatory remarks  poems  proverbs and other phrases  and further commentary about prior emendations   6 1  The Blue Cliff Record  The Blue Cliff Record  Chinese  碧巖錄 Bìyán Lù  Japanese  Hekiganroku  is a collection of 100 kōans compiled in 1125 by Yuanwu

Gate  Chinese  無門關 Wumenguan  Japanese  Mumonkan  is a collection of 48 kōans and commentaries published in 1228 by Chinese monk Wumen  無門   1183–1260   The title may be more accurately rendered as Gateless Barrier or Gateless Checkpoint    Five kōans in the collection derive from the sayings and doings of Zhaozhou Congshen   transliterated as Chao chou in Wade Giles and pronounced Jōshū in Japanese    6 4  The True Dharma Eye  The True Dharma Eye 300  Shōbōgenzō Sanbyakusoku  is a collection of 300 kōans compiled by Eihei Dōgen   Other kōan collections compiled and annotated by Soto

in Japanese  meaning  no    not    nonbeing   or  without  in English  This is a fragment of Case #1 of the Wúménguān  However  another koan presents a longer version  in which Zhaozhou answered  yes  in response to the same question asked by a different monk  see Case #18 of the Book of Serenity    7 2  The sound of one hand  Victor Hori comments   7 3  Original Face  Huìnéng asked Hui Ming   Without thinking of good or evil  show me your original face before your mother and father were born    This is a fragment of case #23 of the Wumenguan    7 4  Killing the Buddha  Thinking about the Buddha as an entity or deity is delusion  not awakening  One must destroy the preconception of the Buddha as separate and external before one can become internally as their own Buddha  Zen master Shunryu Suzuki wrote in Zen Mind  Beginner s Mind during an introduction to Zazen   One is only able to see a Buddha as he exists in separation from Buddha  the mind of the practitioner is thus still holding onto apparent duality   7 5  Other koans  A student asked Master Yun Men  A D  949   Not even a thought has arisen  is there still a sin or not   Master replied   Mount Sumeru    A monk asked Dongshan Shouchu   What is Buddha   Dongshan said   Three pounds of flax    This is a fragment of case #18 of the Wumenguan as well as case #12 of the Blue Cliff Record    A monk asked Zhaozhou   What
