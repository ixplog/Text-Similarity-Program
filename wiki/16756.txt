Korean    see below  is the official language of South Korea and North Korea  as well as one of the two official languages in China s Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  About 80 million people speak Korean worldwide  For over a millennium  Koreans wrote with adapted Chinese characters called hanja  complemented by phonetic systems like hyangchal  gugyeol  and idu  In the 15th century  Sejong the Great commissioned a national writing system called Hangeul  but it only came into widespread use in the 20th century  because of the yangban aristocracy s preference for hanja   Some historical linguists classify Korean as a language isolate  whereas others consider it to be in the controversial Altaic language family  The Korean language is agglutinative in its morphology and SOV in its syntax   1  Names  The Korean names for the language are based on the names for Korea used in North and South Korea   In South Korea  the language is most often called Hangungmal     consisting of Hanguk       the South Korean name for Korea  and mal       meaning  speech   the at the end of the first word becomes by the rules of consonant assimilation in Korean phonology  More formally  it may also be called Hangugeo    or Gugeo    literally  national language     In North Korea and Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China  the language is most often called Chosŏnmal     or more formally  Chosŏnŏ      The English word  Korean  is derived from Goryeo  고려   which is thought to be the first dynasty known to Western countries  Korean people in the former USSR  who refer to themselves as Koryo saram  고려사람  also Goryeo In      literally   Goryeo person s     call the language Goryeo Mal      In mainland China  following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992  the term Cháoxiǎnyǔ   or the short form  Cháoyǔ     has normally been used to refer to the standard language of North Korea and Yanbian  whereas Hánguóyǔ   or the short form  Hányǔ     is used to refer to the standard language of South Korea   Some older English sources also use the spelling  Corean  to refer to the language  country  and people   2  Classification  Korean is far from the Altaic languages in most grammatical elements  including articles  fusional morphology  and relative pronouns  Since Ramstedt s 1928 article  some linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an Altaic language or as a relative of proto Altaic  However  linguists agree today that typological resemblances cannot be used to prove genetic relatedness of languages  as these features are typologically connected and easily borrowed  Such factors of typological divergence as Middle Mongolian s exhibition of gender agreement can be used to argue that a genetic relationship is unlikely   The hypothesis that Korean might be related to Japanese has had some supporters due to some apparent overlap in vocabulary and similar grammatical features that have been elaborated upon by such researchers as Samuel E  Martin and Roy Andrew Miller  Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin  1991  found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese–Korean 100 word Swadesh list  which—if valid—would place these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family   Some linguists  most notably Alexander Vovin  have argued that the indicated similarities between Japanese and Korean are not due to any genetic relationship  but rather to a sprachbund effect and heavy borrowing  especially from ancient Korean into Western Old Japanese  A good example might be Middle Korean sàm and Japanese asa  hemp   This word seems to be a cognate  but although it is well attested in Western Old Japanese and Northern Ryūkyū  in Eastern Old Japanese it only occurs in compounds  and it is only present in three subdialects of the South Ryūkyūan dialect group  Then  the doublet wo  hemp  is attested in Western Old Japanese and Southern Ryūkyū  It is thus plausible to assume a borrowed term   See Classification of Japonic languages for further details on a possible relationship    Among ancient languages  various closer relatives of Korean have been proposed  constituting a possible small Koreanic language family  Some classify the language of Jeju Island as a distinct modern Koreanic language   3  History  Korean is descended from Proto Korean  Old Korean  Middle Korean  and Modern Korean  Since the Korean War  contemporary North–South differences have developed in standard Korean  including variance in pronunciation  verb inflection  and vocabulary   4  Geographic distribution  Korean is spoken by the Korean people in North Korea and South Korea and by the Korean diaspora in many countries including the People s Republic of China  the United States  Japan  and Russia  Korean speaking minorities exist in these states  but because of cultural assimilation into host countries  not all ethnic Koreans may speak it with native fluency   4 1  Official status  Korean is the official language of South Korea and North Korea  It is also one of the two official languages of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China   In South Korea  the regulatory body for Korean is the Seoul based National Institute of the Korean Language    國立國語院   which was created by presidential decree on January 23  1991  In North Korea  the regulatory body is the Language Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences    社會科學院語學研究所  Sahoe Kwahagwon Ŏhak Yŏnguso    5  Dialects  Korean has numerous small local dialects  called mal     literally  speech    saturi     or bang eon    in Korean   The standard language  pyojuneo or pyojunmal  of both South Korea and North Korea is based on the dialect of the area around Seoul  though the northern standard has been influenced by the dialect of P yŏngyang  All dialects of Korean are similar to each other and at least partially mutually intelligible  though the dialect of Jeju Island is divergent enough to be sometimes classified as a separate language  One of the more salient differences between dialects is the use of tone  speakers of Seoul dialect make use of vowel length  whereas speakers of the Gyeongsang dialect maintain the pitch accent of Middle Korean  Some dialects are conservative  maintaining Middle Korean sounds  such as z  β  ə  which have been lost from the standard language  whereas others are highly innovative   There is substantial evidence for a history of extensive dialect levelling  or even convergent evolution or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks  within the Korean language and its dialects  Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects  such as South Jeolla dialect  kur  vs  Standard Korean 입  mouth  or Gyeongsang dialect vs  Standard Korean  garlic chives   This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present  See also the Buyeo languages hypothesis   There are few clear boundaries between Korean dialects  and they are typically partially grouped according to the regions of Korea   6  Sounds  6 1  Consonants  1 The liquids  w  and  j  are represented in Korean writing by modifications to vowel symbols  see below    The IPA symbol  a subscript double straight quotation mark  shown here with a placeholder circle  is used to denote the tensed consonants   Its official use in the Extensions to the IPA is for  strong  articulation  but is used in the literature for faucalized voice  The Korean consonants also have elements of stiff voice  but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants  They are produced with a partially constricted glottis and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls  laryngeal lowering  or other expansion of the larynx   6 2  Vowels  ㅏ is closer to a near open central vowel     though is still used for tradition   6 3  Allophones  is aspirated and becomes an alveolo palatal before or for most speakers  but see North–South differences in the Korean language   This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well  At the end of a syllable   s  changes to  t   Example  beoseot  버섯   mushroom     may become a bilabial before or   a palatal before or   a velar before   a voiced between voiced sounds  and a elsewhere   become voiced between voiced sounds   frequently denasalize to at the beginnings of words   becomes alveolar flap between vowels  and or at the end of a syllable or next to another   Note that a written syllable final  ㄹ   when followed by a vowel or a glide  i e   when the next character starts with  ㅇ    migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes    Traditionally  was disallowed at the beginning of a word  It disappeared before   and otherwise became   However  the inflow of western loanwords changed the trend  and now word initial  mostly from English loanwords  are pronounced as a free variation of either or   The traditional prohibition of word initial became a morphological rule called  initial law   두음법칙  in South Korea  which pertains to Sino Korean vocabulary  Such words retain their word initial in North Korea   All obstruents  plosives  affricates  fricatives  at the end of a word are pronounced with no audible release     Plosive stops become nasal stops before nasal stops   Hangeul spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules  but rather maintains the underlying  partly historical morphology  Given this  it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial   and initial   For example    labor  – north  rodong  로동   south  nodong  노동    history  – north  ryŏksa  력사   south  yeoksa  역사    female  – north  nyŏja  녀자   south  yeoja  여자   6 4  Morphophonemics  Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds  Examples include  eun  neun   은  는  and  i  ga   이  가   Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead  Examples include  eul  reul   을  를    euro  ro   으로  로    eseo  seo   에서  서    ideunji  deunji   이든지  든지  and  iya  ya   이야  야   However   euro  ro is somewhat irregular  since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant   Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically   7  Grammar  Korean is an agglutinative language  The Korean language is traditionally considered to have nine parts of speech  For details  see Korean parts of speech  Modifiers generally precede the modified words  and in the case of verb modifiers  can be serially appended  The basic form of a Korean sentence is subject–object–verb  but the verb is the only required and immovable element   7 1  Speech levels and honorifics  The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean  and the grammar reflects this  The relationship between speaker writer and subject referent is reflected in honorifics  whereas that between speaker writer and audience is reflected in speech level   7 1 1  Honorifics  When talking about someone superior in status  a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject s superiority  Generally  someone is superior in status if he she is an older relative  a stranger of roughly equal or greater age  or an employer  teacher  customer  or the like  Someone is equal or inferior in status if he she is a younger stranger  student  employee or the like  Nowadays  there are special endings which can be used on declarative  interrogative  and imperative sentences  and both honorific or normal sentences  They are made for easier and faster use of Korean   Honorifics in traditional Korea were strictly hierarchical  The caste and estate systems possessed patterns and usages much more complex and stratified than those used today  The intricate structure of the Korean honorific system flourished in traditional culture and society  Honorifics in contemporary Korea are now used for people who are psychologically distant  Honorifics are also used for people who are superior in status  For example  older relatives  people who are older  teachers  and employers   7 1 2  Speech levels  There are seven verb paradigms or speech levels in Korean  and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation  Unlike honorifics—which are used to show respect towards the referent  the person spoken of  —speech levels are used to show respect towards a speaker s or writer s audience  the person spoken to   The names of the seven levels are derived from the non honorific imperative form of the verb 하다  hada   do   in each level  plus the suffix 체   che   hanja  體   which means  style    The highest six levels are generally grouped together as jondaenmal  존댓말   whereas the lowest level  haeche  해체  is called banmal  반말  in Korean   Nowadays  younger generation speakers no longer feel obligated to lower their usual regard toward the referent  It is common to see younger people talk to their older relatives with banmal  반말   This is not out of disrespect  but instead it shows the intimacy and the closeness of the relationship between the two speakers  Transformations in social structures and attitudes in today s rapidly changing society have brought about change in the way people speak   7 1 3  Gender and Korean language  Traditionally Korean women are often viewed as subservient to men  and this in turn is observed in their everyday speech patterns  Some examples of this can be seen in   1  a woman’s use of softer tone in order to minimize conflict or aggression   2  a married woman introducing herself as someone’s mother or wife  not with her own name   3  the presence of gender differences in titles and occupational terms  for example  a sajang is a company president and yŏsajang is a female company president     4  and females sometimes using more tag questions and rising tones in statements  much like the way that young children talk   In Western societies  individuals won t avoid expressions of power asymmetry  mutually addressing each other by their first names for the sake of solidarity  Between two people of asymmetrical status in a Korean society  people tend to emphasize differences in status for the sake of solidarity  Koreans prefer to use kinship terms rather than any other terms of reference  In traditional Korean society  women have long been in disadvantaged positions  Korean social structure traditionally consisted of a royal monarch  a patriarchically dominated family system that emphasizes the maintenance of family lines  This structure has tended to separate roles of women from those of men   8  Vocabulary  The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words  A significant proportion of the vocabulary  especially words that denote abstract ideas  are Sino Korean words  either  directly borrowed from written Chinese  or  coined in Korea or Japan using Chinese characters  The exact proportion of Sino Korean vocabulary is a matter of debate  Sohn  2001  stated 50–60%  Later  the same author  2006  p  5  gives an even higher estimate of 65%  Jeong Jae do  one of the compilers of the dictionary Urimal Keun Sajeon  asserts that the proportion is not so high  He points out that Korean dictionaries compiled during the colonial period include many unused Sino Korean words  In his estimation  the proportion of native Korean vocabulary in the Korean language might be as high as 70%   Korean has two numeral systems  one native  and one borrowed from Sino Korean   To a much lesser extent  some words have also been borrowed from Mongolian and other languages  Conversely  the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages  most notably the Tsushima dialect of Japanese   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino Korean come from modern times  approximately 90% of which are from English  Many words have also been borrowed from Western languages such as German via Japanese  아르바이트  areubaiteu   part time job   알레르기  allereugi   allergy   기브스  gibseu or gibuseu   plaster cast used for broken bones    Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Korea  taking a Japanese sound pattern  for example  dozen    dāsu   daseu  Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current  Hangeulization  rules for the respective Western language  as if borrowed directly  There are a few more complicated borrowings such as  German y    see names of Germany   the first part of whose endonym the Japanese approximated using the kanji doitsu that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino Korean pronunciation   dok +  il   Dogil  In South Korean official use  a number of other Sino Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented  Hangeulizations  of the countries  endonyms or English names   Because of such a prevalence of English in modern Korean culture and society  lexical borrowing is inevitable  English derived Korean  or  Konglish   콩글리쉬   is increasingly used  The vocabulary of the Korean language is roughly 5% loanwords  excluding Sino Korean vocabulary    As in Japanese  Korean uses words adapted from English in ways that may seem strange to native English speakers  For example  in soccer heading    is used as a noun meaning a  header   whereas fighting    is a term of encouragement like  come on   go  on   in English  Something that is  service     is free or  on the house   A building referred to as an  apart uh     is an  apartment   but in fact refers to a residence more akin to a condominium  and a type of pencil that is called a  sharp     is a mechanical pencil   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino Korean or foreign borrowings  especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign influences on the Korean language in the North  In the early years  the North Korean government tried to eliminate Sino Korean words  Consequently  South Korean may have several Sino Korean or foreign borrowings which are not in North Korean   8 1  Slang  9  Writing system  Formerly  the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using hanja  called hyangchal or idu  the use of Chinese characters either as rebuses to stand for Korean words  or as synonyms for those words  Writing was confined to the ruling elite  who most often wrote only in Classical Chinese   Sejong the Great promulgated the Korean alphabet in 1446  Korean is now written almost exclusively in Hangeul  Although South Korean schools still teach 1 800 hanja  North Korea abolished hanja decades ago   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet s symbols and their canonical IPA values   Modern Korean is written with spaces between words  a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese  Korean punctuation marks are almost identical to Western ones  Traditionally  Korean was written in columns  from top to bottom  right to left  but is now usually written in rows  from left to right  top to bottom   10  Differences between North Korean and South Korean  The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation  spelling  grammar and vocabulary   10 1  Pronunciation  In North Korea  palatalization of is optional  and can be pronounced between vowels   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently  such as the examples below  The pronunciations below are given in Revised Romanization  McCune–Reischauer and Hangeul  the last of which represents what the Hangeul would be if one were to write the word as pronounced   Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja  的  is attached to a Sino Korean word ending in ㄴ  ㅁ or ㅇ   In the South  this rule only applies when it is attached to any single character Sino Korean word    10 2  Spelling  Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South  but the pronunciations are the same   10 3  Spelling and pronunciation  Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South  some of which were given in the  Phonology  section above   In general  when transcribing place names  North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea  which often uses the pronunciation in English  For example   10 4  Grammar  Some grammatical constructions are also different   10 5  Vocabulary  Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South   10 6  Punctuation  In the North  guillemets and are the symbols used for quotes  in the South  quotation marks equivalent to the English ones  “ and ”  are standard  although and are also used   11  Study by non native learners  For native English speakers  Korean is generally considered to be one of the most difficult languages to master despite the relative ease of learning Hangeul  For instance  the United States  Defense Language Institute places Korean in Category IV  which also includes Arabic  Japanese  and Chinese  This means that 63 weeks of instruction  as compared to just 25 weeks for French  Spanish  Portuguese  and Italian  are required to bring an English speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has  sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements  and  can deal with concrete topics in past  present  and future tense   Similarly  the Foreign Service Institute places Korean in Category V  the highest level of difficulty   The study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by Korean American heritage language students  they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non military universities  However  Sejong Institutes in the United States have noted a sharp rise in the number of people of other ethnic backgrounds studying Korean between 2009 and 2011  they attribute this to rising popularity of South Korean music and television shows   Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages  such as Japanese  in Japan  it is more widely studied by non heritage learners   11 1  Korean language tests  There are two widely used tests of Korean as a foreign language  the Korean Language Proficiency Test  KLPT  and the Test of Proficiency in Korean  TOPIK   The Korean Language Proficiency Test  an examination aimed at assessing non native speakers  competence in Korean  was instituted in 1997  17 000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination  The TOPIK was first administered in 1997 and was taken by 2 274 people  Since then the total number of people who have taken the TOPIK has surpassed 1 million  with more than 150 000 candidates taking the test in 2012   The TOPIK test has three different difficulty levels  beginner  intermediate  and advanced  the difficulty level of the test taken determines the level achieved—the beginner test is levels 1 and 2  intermediate is levels 3 and 4  and advanced is levels 5 and 6  The TOPIK includes four sections  vocabulary grammar  어휘및 문법   writing  쓰기   listening  듣기   and reading  읽기   The vocabulary grammar section  listening section  and reading section each consist of 30 multiple choice questions worth a total of 100 points  The writing section consists of 10 multiple choice questions worth 4 points each  and 4 6 written responses worth 60 points  The overall total score out of 400 is determined by adding up the 4 scores from each individual 100 point section  However  the level achieved is not simply a matter of achieving a minimum total score  the test taker must achieve a minimum score in each section in addition to a minimum average total score  In order to achieve the lower of the two levels on each test  levels 1  3  and 5   the test taker must get at least 40 points in each of the four sections  and must get an average total score of 50 on the four sections  In order to achieve the higher of the two levels on each test  levels 2  4  and 6   the test taker must get at least 50 points in each of the four sections  and must get an average total score of 70 on the four sections   12  See also  Hangeul  Korean count word  Korean language and
