Ouida    1 January 1839 舑 25 January 1908  was the pseudonym of the English novelist Maria Louise Ramé  although she preferred to be known as Marie Louise de la Ramée    1  Biography  Maria Louise Ramé was born at Bury St  Edmunds  England  Her mother was English and her father was from France  his first language was French  She derived her pen name from her own childish pronunciation of her given name  Louise   Her opinion of her birthplace fluctuated  she wrote   She moved into the Langham Hotel  London in 1867  There  according to the hotel promotional materials  she wrote in bed  by candlelight  with the curtains drawn and surrounded by purple flowers  She ran up huge hotel and florists bills  and commanded soirees that included soldiers  politicians  literary lights  including Oscar Wilde  Algernon Swinburne  Robert Browning and Wilkie Collins   and artists  including John Millais   Many of her stories and characters were based upon people she invited to her salons at The Langham  Ouida was described by William Allingham in his diary of 1872 as of short stature  with a  sinister  clever face  and with a  voice like a carving knife    For many years Ouida lived in London  but about 1871 she moved to Italy  In 1874  she settled permanently with her mother in Florence  and there long pursued her work as a novelist  At first she rented an  apartment  at the Palazzo Vagnonville  Later she removed to the Villa Farinola at Scandicci  south of Bellosguardo  three miles from Florence  where she lived in great style  entertained largely  collected objets d art  dressed expensively but not tastefully  drove good horses  and kept many dogs  to which she was deeply attached  She lived in Bagni di Lucca for a period  where there is a commemorative plaque on the outside wall  She declared that she never received from her publishers more than £1600  for any one novel  but that she found America  a mine of wealth   In  The Massarenes   1897  she gave a lurid picture of the parvenu millionaire in smart London society  This book was greatly prized by Ouida  and was very successful in terms of sales  Thenceforth she chiefly wrote for the leading magazines essays on social questions or literary criticisms  which were not remunerative  As before  she used her locations as inspiration for the setting and characters in her novels  The British and American colony in Florence was satirised in her novel  Friendship  1878   Ouida considered herself a serious artist  She was inspired by Byron in particular  and was interested in other artists of all kinds  Sympathetic descriptions of tragic painters and singers occurred in her later novels  Her work often combines romanticism with social criticism  In her novel  Puck  a talking dog narrates his views on society  Views and Opinions includes essays in her own voice on a variety of social topics   Although successful  she did not manage her money well  A civil list pension of £150 a year was offered to her by the prime minister  Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman  on the application of Alfred Austin  George Wyndham  and Walburga  Lady Paget  which she reluctantly accepted after request by her friend  Lady Howard of Glossop  on 16 July 1906   She continued to live in Italy until her death on 25 January 1908  at 70 Via Zanardelli  Viareggio  of pneumonia She is buried in the English Cemetery in Bagni di Lucca  Italy   2  Literary career  During her career  Ouida wrote more than 40 novels  children s books and collections of short stories and essays  She was an animal lover and rescuer  and at times owned as many as thirty dogs  Ouida s work had several phases   Her first novel  Held in Bondage was published in 1863  when she was 24   She later claimed to have written Idalia  a well known novel  at the age of 16  It featured a heroine who was a rebel ingenue sympathetic to Italian independence   In her early period  her novels were considered  racy  and  swashbuckling   a contrast to  the moralistic prose of early Victorian literature   Tom Steele   and a hybrid of the sensationalism of the 1860s and the proto adventure novels being published as part of the romanticisation of imperial expansion  Later her work was more typical of historical romance  though she never stopped comment on contemporary society  She also wrote several stories for children   Under Two Flags  one of her most well known novels  described the British in Algeria  It expressed sympathy for the French colonists  called pieds noirs —with whom Ouida deeply identified—and  to some extent  the Arabs  This book was adapted as dramatic plays  and was adapted four times as a film  The American author Jack London cited her novel Signa  which he read at age eight  as one of the eight reasons for his literary success   3  Influence  The British composer Frederic Hymen Cowen and his librettists Gilbert Arthur à Beckett  H A  Rudall  and Frederic Edward Weatherly acquired the rights to Ouida s 1875 novel Signa to create an opera for Richard D Oyly Carte s Royal English Opera House to succeed Arthur Sullivan s Ivanhoe in 1891  Between Cowen not being ready with his work and the collapse of Carte s venture  Cowen eventually took his finished Signa to Italy with an Italian translation of the original English text by G A  Mazzucato  After many delays and production troubles  Cowen s Signa was first performed in a reduced three act version at the Teatro Dal Verme  Milan on 12 November 1893  After further revision and much cutting  it was later given in a two act version at Covent Garden  London on 30 June 1894  at which point Cowen wondered if there was any sense left in the opera at all  Ouida s impression of the work is unknown   Later  Pietro Mascagni bought the rights for her story  Two Little Wooden Shoes   intending to adapt it for an opera  His friend Giacomo Puccini became interested in the story and began a court action  claiming that because Ouida was in debt  the rights to her works should be put up for public auction to raise funds for creditors  He won the court challenge and persuaded his publisher Ricordi to bid for the story  After Ricordi won  Puccini lost interest and never composed the opera  Mascagni later composed one based on the story  under the title Lodoletta   4  Legacy and honours  Soon after her death  her friends organized a public subscription in Bury St Edmunds  where they had a fountain for horses and dogs installed in her name  Its inscription was composed by Lord Curzon  Fellow author  Rita  Humphreys  Eliza Margaret Jane Humphreys  1850 1938  wrote a eulogy to Ouida and sent it to the press soon after her death  It was read at the unveiling of Ouida’s memorial  During Rita s youth  Ouida had been popular but the girl was forbidden to read her  She made up for it later by purchasing every book written by Ouida and keeping them in her library for the rest of her life   5  Bibliography  Two Little Wooden Shoes  1874
