Politics of Tonga takes place in a framework of a constitutional monarchy  whereby the King is the Head of State and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces  Tonga s Prime Minister is currently appointed by the King from among the members of Parliament after having won the support of a majority of its members  Executive power is vested in the Cabinet of Ministers  Legislative power is vested in the King in Parliament  and judicial power is vested in the supreme court   1  Political conditions  For most of the 20th century Tonga was quiet  inward looking  and somewhat isolated from developments elsewhere in the world  Tonga s complex social structure is essentially broken into three tiers  the king  the nobles  and the commoners  Between the nobles and commoners are Matapule  sometimes called  talking chiefs   who are associated with the king or a noble and who may or may not hold estates  Obligations and responsibilities are reciprocal  and although the nobility are able to extract favors from people living on their estates  they likewise must extend favors to their people  Status and rank play a powerful role in personal relationships  even within families   Tongans are beginning to confront the problem of how to preserve their cultural identity and traditions in the wake of the increasing impact of Western technology and culture  Migration and the gradual monetization of the economy have led to the breakdown of the traditional extended family  Some of the poor  once supported by the extended family  are now being left without visible means of support   Educational opportunities for young commoners have advanced  and their increasing political awareness has stimulated some dissent against the nobility system  In addition  the rapidly increasing population is already too great to provide the constitutionally mandated 8 25 acre  33 000 m²  api for each male at age 16  In mid 1982  population density was 134 persons per square kilometer  Because of these factors  there is considerable pressure to move to the Kingdom s only urban center   In the March 2002 election  seven of nine popularly elected representatives were chosen under the pro democratic banner with the remaining two representing  traditionalist  values  The nine nobles and all the cabinet ministers that sit in the Legislative Assembly generally support the government  Tonga does not rate as an  electoral democracy  under the criteria of Freedom House s Freedom in the World 2006 report  This is likely because while elections exist  they can only elect nine of 30 Legislative Assembly seats  the remainder being selected either by the nobility or the government  as such the people have a voice in but no control over the government   In 2003  the Taimi  o Tonga  Tongan Times   a newspaper published in New Zealand in the Tongan language that had been critical of the government was prohibited from distribution in Tonga due to government objections to its political content  After the newspaper obtained two court orders  it was again distributed freely  A Media Operators Bill and constitutional amendment  intended to restrict media freedom in Tonga  was hotly debated in 2003  The legislation allowed the government to exert control over coverage of  cultural  and  moral  issues  ban publications it deemed offensive  and ban foreign ownership of the media  In October 2003  thousands of Tongans marched peacefully through the streets of the capital city Nukualofa in an unprecedented demonstration against the government s plans to limit media freedom  Despite the protests  the Media Operators Bill and constitutional amendment passed the Legislature and as of December 2003 needed only the King s signature to become law   By February 2004  the amendment was passed and licensure of news media was required  Those papers denied licenses under the new act included the Taimi  o Tonga  Tongan Times   the Kele a and the Matangi Tonga  while those permitted licenses were uniformly church based or pro government  Further opposition to government action included calls by the Tu i Pelehake  a prince  nephew of the King and elected member of parliament  for Australia and other nations to pressure the Tongan government to democratize the electoral system  and a legal writ calling for a judicial investigation of the bill  The latter was supported by some 160 people  including 7 of the 9 elected  People s Representatives    In 2005 the government spent several weeks negotiating with striking civil service workers before reaching a settlement  A constitutional commission met in 2005 2006 to study proposals to update the constitution  A copy of the commission s report was presented to King Taufa ahau Tupou IV  shortly before his death in September 2006 and is currently under study by the present king  George Tupou V  and members of parliament   The Tongan Speaker of the House was found to be guilty of bribery   Prime Minister Prince Lavaka Ata  Ulukalala resigned suddenly on 11 February 2006  and also gave up his other cabinet portfolios  He was replaced by the elected Minister of Labour  Dr  Feleti Sevele   The public expected democratic changes from the new monarch  On November 16  2006  rioting broke out in the capital city of Nukualofa when it seemed that the parliament would adjourn for the year without having made any advances in increasing democracy in government  Government buildings  offices  and shops were looted and burned  Eight people died in the riots  The government agreed that elections would be held in 2008 in which a majority of the parliament would be elected by popular vote  A state of emergency was declared on November 17  with emergency laws giving security forces the right to stop and search people without a warrant   On 29 May 2008  in the speech from the throne at the opening of Parliament  Princess Regent  Salote Mafile o Pilolevu Tuita announced that the government would introduce a political reform bill by June 2008  and that the current term of Parliament would be the last one under the current constitution  1 1  Relinquishing the monarch s powers  In July 2008  three days before his coronation  King George Tupou V announced that he would relinquish most of his power and be guided by his Prime Minister s recommendations on most matters   In November of 2009  a constitutional review panel recommended a ceremonial monarchy stripped of real political power and to invest political power in a completely elected Legislative Assembly which  up to this point was largely hereditary due to the fact that most of the seats where designated for the nobles   2  Executive   King  Tupou VI    18 March 2012     Prime Minister  ʻAkilisi Pohiva  Democratic Party of the
