William Topaz McGonagall  March 1825 – 29 September 1902  was a Scottish weaver  doggerel poet and actor  He won notoriety as an extremely bad poet who exhibited no recognition of  or concern for  his peers  opinions of his work   He wrote about 200 poems  including his notorious  The Tay Bridge Disaster   which are widely regarded as some of the worst in English literature  Groups throughout Scotland engaged him to make recitations from his work and contemporary descriptions of these performances indicate that many listeners were appreciating McGonagall s skill as a comic music hall character  Collections of his verse remain popular  with several volumes available today   McGonagall has been acclaimed as the worst poet in British history  The chief criticisms are that he is deaf to poetic metaphor and unable to scan correctly  In the hands of lesser artists  this might generate dull  uninspiring verse  McGonagall s fame stems from the humorous effects these shortcomings generate  The inappropriate rhythms  weak vocabulary  and ill advised imagery combine to make his work amongst the most unintentionally amusing dramatic poetry in the English language  His work is in a long tradition of narrative ballads and verse written and published about great events and tragedies  and widely circulated among the local population as handbills  In an age before radio and television  their voice was one way of communicating important news to an avid public   1  Early life  Throughout his adult life  McGonagall claimed to have been born in Edinburgh  giving his year of birth variously as 1825 and 1830  His parents were both Irish   However  his entry in the 1841 Census gives his place of birth  like his parents   as  Ireland   It has been suggested that he falsified his place of birth  as a native Scotsman would be treated better under the Poor Law than an Irish Immigrant would have been   2  Career  McGonagall moved north and was apprenticed as a handloom weaver in Dundee  following in his father s footsteps  In 1846  he married Jean King  they had five sons and two daughters  Despite the industrial revolution slowly making weavers obsolete  McGonagall appeared to prosper  as there was still need for skilled workers to perform tasks of great complexity   Before he showed an interest in poetry  he displayed a keenness for acting  though Mr Giles  Theatre  where he performed  let him play the title role in Macbeth only if he paid for the privilege  The theatre was filled with his friends and fellow workers  anxious to see what they expected to be an amusing disaster  The play should have ended with Macbeth s death  but McGonagall believed the actor playing Macduff was trying to upstage him  and refused to die   By the 1870s  McGonagall and his family were struggling  Work as a weaver was more difficult to find and his oldest daughter shamed the family by giving birth to an illegitimate child  However  an event changed him  He would write   McGonagall claimed he was inspired to become a poet when he  seemed to feel a strange kind of feeling stealing over  him   and remained so for about five minutes  A flame  as Lord Byron said  seemed to kindle up  his  entire frame  along with a strong desire to write poetry   He wrote his first poem   An Address to the Rev  George Gilfillan   displaying the hallmarks that would characterise his work  Gilfillan  himself an untrained and poorly reviewed polemic Christian preacher who occasionally dabbled in poetry  commented admiringly  Shakespeare never wrote anything like this    McGonagall realised if he were to succeed as a poet  he required a patron and wrote to Queen Victoria  He received a letter of rejection  written by a royal functionary  thanking him for his interest  McGonagall took this as praise for his work  During a trip to Dunfermline in 1879  he was mocked by the Chief Templar  who told him his poetry was very bad  McGonagall told the man that  it was so very bad that Her Majesty had thanked  McGonagall  for what  the Chief Templar  had condemned    The letter gave McGonagall confidence in his  poetic abilities   and he felt his reputation could be enhanced further if he were to give a live performance before the queen  In July 1878  he walked from Dundee to Balmoral  a distance of about over mountainous terrain and through a violent thunderstorm   wet to the skin   to perform for Queen Victoria  When he arrived  he announced himself as  The Queen s Poet   The guards informed him  You re not the Queen s poet  Tennyson is the Queen s poet    Alfred Lord Tennyson was the poet laureate   McGonagall presented the letter but was refused entry and had to return home  Undeterred  his poetry writing continued  and he reported events to the newspapers  earning some minor recognition   Throughout his life McGonagall campaigned against excessive drinking  appearing in pubs and bars to give edifying poems and speeches  These were popular  the people of Dundee possibly recognising that McGonagall was  so giftedly bad he backed unwittingly into genius  He met with the ire of the publicans  on one occasion being pelted with peas for reciting a poem about the evils of  strong drink    In 1883 he celebrated the official opening of University College  Dundee with the poem  The Inauguration of University College Dundee  which opened with the stanza   McGonagall constantly struggled with money and earned money by selling his poems in the streets  or reciting them in halls  theatres and public houses  When he was in periods of financial insecurity  his friends supported him with donations  In 1880  he sailed to London to seek his fortune  and in 1887 to New York  In both instances  he returned unsuccessful   He found lucrative work performing his poetry at a local circus  He read his poems while the crowd was permitted to pelt him with eggs  flour  herrings  potatoes and stale bread  For this  he received fifteen shillings a night  McGonagall seemed happy with this arrangement  but the events became so raucous that the city magistrates were forced to put a ban on them  McGonagall was outraged and wrote a poem in response entitled  Lines in Protest to the Dundee Magistrates    Throughout his life McGonagall seemed oblivious to the general opinion of his poems  even when his audience were pelting him with eggs and vegetables  It is possible he was shrewder than he is given credit for  and played to his audience s perception of him   In 1890  McGonagall was in dire straits financially  To help him  his friends funded the publication of a collection of his work  Poetic Gems  The proceeds provided McGonagall with enough money to live on for a time  By 1893  he was annoyed by his mistreatment in the streets and wrote an angry poem threatening to leave Dundee  One newspaper quipped that he d probably stay for another year once he realised  that Dundee rhymes with 1893   Though trying his hand at writing prose and endorsements for local businesses for a short time  in 1894  he and his wife were forced to move to Perth   Soon after  he received a letter purporting to be from representatives of King Thibaw Min of Burma  In it  he was informed that the King had knighted him as Topaz McGonagall  Grand Knight of the Holy Order of the White Elephant Burmah  Despite the fact that this was a fairly transparent hoax  McGonagall would refer to himself as  Sir William Topaz McGonagall  Knight of the White Elephant  Burmah  in his advertising for the rest of his life   In 1895  McGonagall and his wife moved to Edinburgh  Here  McGonagall met with some success  becoming a  cult figure  and was in great demand  It did not last long  and by 1900 he was once again destitute and now old and sickly  Though he was now too frail to walk the streets selling his poems  donations from friends  as ever  kept him afloat   He died penniless in 1902 and was buried in an unmarked grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh  A grave slab installed to his memory in 1999 is inscribed   Additionally  a plaque above 5 South College Street in Edinburgh shows an image of McGonagall  and bears the inscription   2 1  Possible Asperger s  Author Norman Watson speculates in his biography of McGonagall that the poetaster may have been on the  autism Asperger s spectrum   Christopher Hart  writing in the Sunday Times  says that this seems  likely    3  Tay Bridge Disaster  Of the 200 or so poems that he wrote  the most famous is probably  The Tay Bridge Disaster   which recounts the events of the evening of 28 December 1879  when  during a severe gale  the Tay Rail Bridge near Dundee collapsed as a train was passing over it    Modern sources give the death toll as 75    Few could disagree with McGonagall s closing judgement   McGonagall had previously written a poem in praise of the Tay Bridge   The Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay   With your numerous arches and pillars in so grand array   Once the new replacement bridge had been built  without the least feeling of irony  he proceeded to compose an ode to the new construction   An Address to the New Tay Bridge   Strong enough all windy storms to defy    4  In popular culture  4 1  In comedy  The memory of McGonagall was resurrected by comedian Spike Milligan  A character called McGoonagall frequently appears in The Goon Show  alternately played by Milligan and Peter Sellers  Milligan also occasionally gave readings of McGonagall s verse   An episode of Monty Python s Flying Circus featured a McGonagall esque poet called Ewan McTeagle  whose poems were actually prose requests for money   4 2  In literature and publications  A collection of 35 broadsheet poems of McGonagall  the majority signed by him  was bought for £6 600  including commission  from Lyon & Turnbull  Edinburgh auctionneers  on 16 May 2008   Satirical magazine Private Eye has printed a number of McGonagallesque poems concerning great events of the day  usually under the byline William Rees McGonagall  a portmanteau of McGonagall s name and that of William Rees Mogg  For example  in 2007  they covered the success of the Scottish National Party in the Scottish Parliament election   McGonagall was the subject of the newspaper column Ripley s Believe It or Not  on 11 October 2007  saying he  was often considered the world s worst poet  even by his own publisher  yet his writings are still in print a century after his death    Milligan further recounted McGonagall s life story in the pastiche novel William McGonagall – the Truth at Last  co written with Jack Hobbs   In The Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett  the Nac Mac Feegle have a battle poet  or Gonnagle  who repels the enemy through the awfulness of his poetry  Training up a successor   the old bard congratulates the young one   That  lad   he said proudly   was some of the worst poetry I have heard for a long time  It was offensive to the ear and a torrrture to the soul   a verrry commendable effort  We ll make a gonnagle out o  ye yet     a touching tribute to the memory of William McGonagall   famously excruciating Scottish poet    In the Harry Potter books  author J K  Rowling chose the surname of the Professor of Transfiguration  Minerva McGonagall  because she had heard of McGonagall and loved the surname   The life of the bard  and Corstorphine Round Table s particular affection for the poet  is celebrated in a comic graphic novel by one of its former members  Charles Nasmyth   4 3  In live performances  Billy Connolly visited Dundee and the Tay Bridge during his 1994 World Tour of Scotland  where he talked about McGonagall and recited a passage from his book Poetic Gems   4 4  In motion pictures  A 1974 movie called The Great McGonagall starred Spike Milligan as a fictionalised William McGonagall  Peter Sellers played Queen Victoria   In episode 13 of season 2 of Canadian TV series Murdoch Mysteries  one of the murder victims is holding a copy of a book entitled  The Collected Works of William Topaz McGonagall    4 5  In music  McGonagall s poem The Famous Tay Whale was set to music by Matyas Seiber for the second Hoffnung Music Festival in 1958  The arrangement calls for a narrator  at the premiere the narrator was Edith Evans   full orchestra  a fog horn  and an espresso machine   4 6  In radio  Dundonian actor Brian Cox compared the comic character Bob Servant to McGonagall while playing Servant in a radio adaptation  Servant is the creation of Dundonian author Neil Forsyth who has acknowledged McGonagall as an influence in the Bob Servant character   Cox went on to play the part of William McGonagall in the radio play Topaz  a fictional depiction of his trip to Balmoral which was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 26 October 2013   5  Honours and memorials  McGonagall s home city of Dundee maintains several reminders of his life   The William Topaz McGonagall Appreciation Society held a McGonagall Supper on board the frigate Unicorn on 12 June 1997  during which the courses were allegedly served in reverse order  starting with the coffee and ending with the starters  A short play was performed by local actors   Beginning in 2004  the Dundee Science Centre Education Outreach has hosted an annual Charity McGonagall Gala Dinner  in which guests eat their meal backwards from dessert to starter and hear the welcome address as they depart   combining traditional and unconventional entertainment  with four course dinner  complimentary wine and whisky    There is a McGonagall Square in the West End of Dundee   A number of inscriptions of his poetry have been made  most notably along the side of the River Tay on the pavement of Riverside Drive in Dundee  This monument contains a deliberate spelling mistake   Dundee Central Library maintains a William McGonagall Collection of his works  He is buried in an unmarked grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard  Edinburgh  From c 1950 to 1995 a memorial bench stood on the path immediately to the north side of the church commemorating McGonagall and bearing the typically McGonagall esque inscription  Feeling tired and need a seat  Sit down here  and rest your feet   Unfortunately the bench fell into disrepair and was not replaced  It is not known what became of its small plaque   6  List of poems  McGonagall s poems were published by his friends  in a series of books bearing variations on the title Poetic Gems  In the modern era  the entire series is reprinted in a single collection called The Complete McGonagall  Note that although the Poetic Gems books are listed in chronological order  the time at which the poem was published often has no bearing on when it was written  the  Address to the Rev  George
