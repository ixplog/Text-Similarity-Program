Romantic music is a term denoting an era of Western classical music that began in the late 18th or early 19th century  It was related to Romanticism  the European artistic and literary movement that arose in the second half of the 18th century  and Romantic music in particular dominated the Romantic movement in Germany   1  Background  1 1  Romanticism  The Romantic movement was an artistic  literary  and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the 18th century in Europe and strengthened in reaction to the Industrial Revolution   In part  it was a revolt against social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature  Casey 2008   It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts  music  and literature  but had a major impact on historiography  Levin 1959    education   and natural history    One of the first significant applications of the term to music was in 1789  in the Mémoires by the Frenchman André Grétry  but it was E T A  Hoffmann who really established the principles of musical romanticism  in a lengthy review of Ludwig van Beethoven s Fifth Symphony published in 1810  and in an 1813 article on Beethoven s instrumental music  In the first of these essays Hoffmann traced the beginnings of musical Romanticism to the later works of Haydn and Mozart  It was Hoffmann s fusion of ideas already associated with the term  Romantic   used in opposition to the restraint and formality of Classical models  that elevated music  and especially instrumental music  to a position of pre eminence in Romanticism as the art most suited to the expression of emotions  It was also through the writings of Hoffmann and other German authors that brought German music to the centre of musical Romanticism    2  Traits  Characteristics often attributed to Romanticism  including musical Romanticism  are    a new preoccupation with and surrender to Nature  a fascination with the past  particularly the Middle Ages and legends of medieval chivalry  a turn towards the mystic and supernatural  both religious and merely spooky  a longing for the infinite  mysterious connotations of remoteness  the unusual and fabulous  the strange and surprising  a focus on the nocturnal  the ghostly  the frightful  and terrifying  fantastic seeing and spiritual experiences  a new attention given to national identity  emphasis on extreme subjectivism  interest in the autobiographical  discontent with musical formulas and conventions Such lists  however  proliferated over time  resulting in a  chaos of antithetical phenomena   criticized for their superficiality and for signifying so many different things that there came to be no central meaning  The attributes have also been criticized for being too vague  For example  features of the  ghostly and supernatural  could apply equally to Mozart s Don Giovanni from 1787 and Stravinsky s The Rake s Progress from 1951    3  Trends of the 19th century  3 1  Non musical influences  Events and changes that happen in society such as ideas  attitudes  discoveries  inventions  and historical events always affect music  For example  the Industrial Revolution was in full effect by the late 18th century and early 19th century  This event had a very profound effect on music  there were major improvements in the mechanical valves  and keys that most woodwinds and brass instruments depend on  The new and innovative instruments could be played with more ease and they were more reliable    Another development that had an effect on music was the rise of the middle class  Composers before this period lived on the patronage of the aristocracy  Many times their audience was small  composed mostly of the upper class and individuals who were knowledgeable about music   The Romantic composers  on the other hand  often wrote for public concerts and festivals  with large audiences of paying customers  who had not necessarily had any music lessons   Composers of the Romantic Era  like Elgar  showed the world that there should be  no segregation of musical tastes  and that the  purpose was to write music that was to be heard     3 2  Nationalism  During the Romantic period  music often took on a much more nationalistic purpose  For example  Jean Sibelius  Finlandia has been interpreted to represent the rising nation of Finland  which would someday gain independence from Russian control   Frédéric Chopin was one of the first composers to incorporate nationalistic elements into his compositions  Joseph Machlis states   Poland s struggle for freedom from tsarist rule aroused the national poet in Poland  … Examples of musical nationalism abound in the output of the romantic era  The folk idiom is prominent in the Mazurkas of Chopin    His mazurkas and polonaises are particularly notable for their use of nationalistic rhythms  Moreover   During World War II the Nazis forbade the playing of … Chopin s Polonaises in Warsaw because of the powerful symbolism residing in these works    Other composers  such as Bedřich Smetana  wrote pieces which musically described their homelands  in particular  Smetana s Vltava is a symphonic poem about the Moldau River in the modern day Czech Republic and the second in a cycle of six nationalistic symphonic poems collectively titled Má vlast  My Homeland    Smetana also composed eight nationalist operas  all of which remain in the repertory  They established him as the first Czech nationalist composer as well as the most important Czech opera composer of the generation who came to prominence in the 1860s    4  See also  List of Romantic era composers  Neoromanticism  music   5  References  6  Further reading  7  External links
