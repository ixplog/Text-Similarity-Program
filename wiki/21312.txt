Navassa Island      Haitian Creole  Lanavaz or Lavash  is a small  uninhabited and disputed island in the Caribbean Sea  It is administered as unorganized unincorporated territory of the United States  which administers it through the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service  The nearby state of Haiti has claimed sovereignty over Navassa since 1801  and claims the island in its constitution   1  Geography  topography and ecology  Navassa Island is about in area  It is located west of Jérémie  Haiti  on the south west peninsula  south of the U S  naval base at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  and about one quarter of the way from Haiti to Jamaica in the Jamaica Channel  It reaches an elevation of at Dunning Hill south of the lighthouse  Navassa Island Light  This location is from the southwestern coast or east of Lulu Bay  The island s latitude and longitude are    The terrain of Navassa Island consists mostly of exposed coral and limestone  the island being ringed by vertical white cliffs high  but with enough grassland to support goat herds  The island is covered in a forest of just four tree species  short leaf fig  Ficus populnea var  brevifolia   pigeon plum  Coccoloba diversifolia   mastic  Sideroxylon foetidissimum   and poisonwood  Metopium brownei    Its topography and ecology are similar to that of Mona Island  a small limestone island located in the Mona Passage  between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic  It shares historical similarities with Mona Island since both are U S  territories  were once centers of guano mining  and presently are nature reserves  Transient Haitian fishermen and others camp on the island but the island is otherwise uninhabited  It has no ports or harbors  only offshore anchorages  and its only natural resource is guano  economic activity consists of subsistence fishing and commercial trawling activities   There were eight species of native reptiles  all of which are believed to be  or to have been  endemic to Navassa Island  Celestus badius  an anguid lizard   Aristelliger cochranae  a gecko   Sphaerodactylus becki  a gecko   Anolis longiceps  an anole   Cyclura  cornuta  onchiopsis  a rock iguana   Leiocephalus eremitus  a curly tailed lizard   Tropidophis bucculentus  a dwarf boa   and Typhlops sulcatus  a tiny snake   Of these  the first four remain common  but the last four are likely extinct   2  History  2 1  1504 to 1901  In 1504  Christopher Columbus  stranded on Jamaica during his fourth voyage  sent some crew members by canoe to Hispaniola for help  They ran into the island on the way  but it had no water  They called it Navaza  from  nava   meaning plain  or field   and it was avoided by mariners for the next 350 years   Despite an earlier claim by Haiti  Navassa Island was claimed for the United States on September 19  1857  by Peter Duncan  an American sea captain  under the Guano Islands Act of August 18  1856  for the rich guano deposits found on the island  and for not being within the lawful jurisdiction of any other government  nor occupied by another government s citizens  Haiti protested the annexation  but on July 7  1858  U S  President James Buchanan issued an Executive Order upholding the American claim  which also called for military action to enforce it  Navassa Island has since been maintained by the United States as an unincorporated territory  according to the Insular Cases   The United States Supreme Court on November 24  1890  in Jones v  United States  137 U S  202  1890  Id  at 224 found that Navassa Island must be considered as appertaining to the United States  creating a legal history for the island under US law unlike many other islands originally claimed under the Guano Islands Act   Guano phosphate was a superior organic fertilizer that became a mainstay of American agriculture in the mid 19th century  Duncan transferred his discoverer s rights to his employer  an American guano trader in Jamaica  who sold them to the newly formed Navassa Phosphate Company of Baltimore  After an interruption for the American Civil War  the Company built larger mining facilities on Navassa with barrack housing for 140 black contract laborers from Maryland  houses for white supervisors  a blacksmith shop  warehouses  and a church  Mining began in 1865  The workers dug out the guano by dynamite and pick axe and hauled it in rail cars to the landing point at Lulu Bay  where it was put into sacks and lowered onto boats for transfer to the Company barque  the S S  Romance  The living quarters at Lulu Bay were called Lulu Town  as appears on old maps  Railway tracks eventually extended inland   Hauling guano by muscle power in the fierce tropical heat  combined with general disgruntlement with conditions on the island  eventually provoked a rebellion in 1889  in which five supervisors died  A U S  warship returned eighteen of the workers to Baltimore for three separate trials on murder charges  A black fraternal society  the Order of Galilean Fisherman  raised money to defend the miners in federal court  and the defense built its case on the contention that the men acted in self defense or in the heat of passion  and that the United States did not have jurisdiction over the island  The cases  including Jones v  United States  went to the U S  Supreme Court in October 1890  which ruled the Guano Act constitutional  and three of the miners were scheduled for execution in the spring of 1891  A grass roots petition drive by black churches around the country  also signed by white jurors from the three trials  reached President Benjamin Harrison  who commuted the sentences to imprisonment and mentioned the case in a State of the Union Address  Guano mining resumed on Navassa at a much reduced level  The Spanish American War of 1898 forced the Phosphate Company to evacuate the island and file for bankruptcy  and the new owners abandoned the island after 1901   2 2  1901 to present  Navassa became significant again with the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914  Shipping between the American eastern seaboard and the Canal goes through the Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti  Navassa  a hazard to navigation  needed a lighthouse  The U S  Lighthouse Service built Navassa Island Light  a 162 foot  46 m  tower on the island in 1917  395 feet  120 m  above sea level  A keeper and two assistants were assigned to live there until the United States Lighthouse Service installed an automatic beacon in 1929  After absorbing the Lighthouse Service in 1939  the U S  Coast Guard serviced the light twice each year  The U S  Navy set up an observation post for the duration of World War II  The island has been uninhabited since then  Fishermen  mainly from Haiti  fish the waters around Navassa   A scientific expedition from Harvard University studied the land and marine life of the island in 1930  After World War II amateur radio operators occasionally visited to operate from the territory  which is accorded  entity   country  status by the American Radio Relay League  The callsign prefix is KP1  From 1903 to 1917  Navassa was a dependency of the U S  Guantanamo Bay Naval Base  and from 1917 to 1996 it was under United States Coast Guard administration  Since January 16  1996  it has been administered by U S  Department of the Interior   On August 29  1996  the United States Coast Guard dismantled the light on Navassa  An inter agency task force headed by the U S  Department of State transferred oversight of the island to the U S  Department of the Interior  By of January 16  1997  the Interior Department assumed control of the island and placed the island under its Office of Insular Affairs  For statistical purposes  Navassa was grouped with the now obsolete term United States Miscellaneous Caribbean Islands and is now grouped with other islands claimed by the U S  under the Guano Islands Act as the United States Minor Outlying Islands   In 1997  an American salvager made a claim to Navassa to the Department of State based on the Guano Islands Act  On March 27  1997  the Department of the Interior rejected the claim on the basis that the Guano Islands Act applies only to islands which  at the time of the claim  are not “appertaining to” the United States  The Department’s opinion said that Navassa is and remains a U S  possession “appertaining to” the United States and is “unavailable to be claimed” under the Guano Islands Act   A 1998  scientific expedition led by the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington  D C  described Navassa as  a unique preserve of Caribbean biodiversity   The island s land and offshore ecosystems have survived the 20th century virtually untouched   By Secretary s Order No  3210 of December 3  1999  the United States Fish and Wildlife Service assumed administrative responsibility for Navassa  which became a National Wildlife Refuge Overlay  also known as Navassa Island National Wildlife Refuge  The Office of Insular Affairs retains authority for the island s political affairs and judicial authority is exercised directly by the nearest U S  Circuit Court  Access to Navassa is hazardous and visitors need permission from the Fish and Wildlife Office in Boquerón  Puerto Rico in order to enter its territorial waters or land  Since this change of status  amateur radio operators have repeatedly been denied entry  However  in October 2014  permission was granted for a two week DXpedition to take place in January 2015  The U S  Department of Interior and the U S  Fish & Wildlife Service who have jurisdiction over Navassa  have given written permission  A license has been issued by the US Federal Communications Commission who has control of all amateur radio licensing on U S  territory  The U S  Coast Guard frequently visits the area to provide surveillance and security   3  Unofficial flag  The unofficial flag of Navassa Island was designed for and first flown at a World War II memorial tribute at the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor  Hawaii on December 7  2001  It is a white and blue horizontal bicolor  with a profile of the island  and its landmark lighthouse  with exaggerated size  in the white band   4  See also  Caribbean Sea  List of Guano Island claims  5  Notes  6  References  7  External links
