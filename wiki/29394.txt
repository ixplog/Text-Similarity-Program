Shrikes are passerine birds of the family Laniidae  The family is composed of thirty one species in three genera  The family name  and that of the largest genus  Lanius  is derived from the Latin word for  butcher   and some shrikes are also known as  butcher birds  because of their feeding habits  They are fairly closely related to the bush shrike family Malaconotidae   1  Distribution  migration and habitat  Most shrike species have a Eurasian and African distribution  with just two breeding in North America  the loggerhead and great grey shrikes   There are no members of this family in South America or Australia  although one species reaches New Guinea  The shrikes vary in the extent of their ranges  with some species like the great grey shrike ranging across the northern hemisphere to the Newton s fiscal which is restricted to the island of São Tomé   They inhabit open habitats  especially steppe and savannah  A few species of shrike are forest dwellers  seldom occurring in open habitats  Some species breed in northern latitudes during the summer  then migrate to warmer climes for the winter   2  Description  Shrikes are medium sized birds  up to in length  with grey  brown  or black and white plumage  Their beaks are hooked  like that of a bird of prey  reflecting their predatory nature  and their calls are strident   3  Behaviour  Shrikes are known for their habit of catching insects and small vertebrates and impaling their bodies on thorns  the spikes on barbed wire fences or any available sharp point  This helps them to tear the flesh into smaller  more conveniently sized fragments  and serves as a cache so that the shrike can return to the uneaten portions at a later time  This same behavior of impaling insects serves as an adaptation to eating the toxic lubber grasshopper  Romalea guttata  The bird waits for 1–2 days for the toxins within the grasshopper to degrade  and then can eat it   Shrikes are territorial  and these territories are defended from other pairs  In migratory species a breeding territory is defended in the breeding grounds and a smaller feeding territory is established during migration and in the wintering grounds  Where several species of shrike exist together competition for territories can be intense   Shrikes make regular use of exposed perch sites  where they adopt a conspicuous upright stance  These sites are used in order to watch for prey items and to advertise their presence to rivals   3 1  Breeding  The shrikes are generally monogamous breeders  although polygyny has been recorded in some species  Co operative breeding  where younger birds help their parents raise the next generation of young  has been recorded in both species in the genera Eurocephalus and Corvinella as well as one species of Lanius  Males attract females to their territory with well stocked caches  which may include inedible but brightly coloured items  During courtship the male will perform a ritualised dance which includes actions that mimic the skewering of prey on thorns and will feed the female  Shrikes make simple  cup shaped nests from twigs and grasses  in bushes and the lower branches of trees   4

with similar names  Other species  popularly called  shrikes   are in the families   Prionopidae  helmetshrikes   Malaconotidae  puffback shrikes  bush shrikes  tchagras and boubous   Campephagidae  Cuckoo shrikes  The Prionopidae and Malaconotidae are quite closely related to the Laniidae  and were formerly included in the shrike family  The cuckoo shrikes are not closely related to the true shrikes   The Australasian butcherbirds are not shrikes  although they occupy a similar ecological niche   5  References  6  External links  on the Internet Bird Collection
