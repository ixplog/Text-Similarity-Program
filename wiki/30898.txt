The Treaty of Verdun  signed in August 843  was the first of the treaties that divided the Carolingian Empire into three kingdoms among the three surviving sons of Louis the Pious  the son and successor of Charlemagne  The treaty signed in Verdun sur Meuse ended the three year Carolingian Civil War   1  Background  When Louis the Pious died in 840  his eldest son  Lothair I  claimed overlordship over the whole of his father s kingdom and supported the claim of his nephew Pepin II to Aquitaine  a large province in the west of the Frankish realm  Lothair s brother Louis the German and his half brother Charles the Bald refused to acknowledge Lothair s suzerainty and went to war against him  They defeated Lothair at the Battle of Fontenay in 841 and sealed their alliance in 842 with the Oaths of Strasbourg which declared Lothair unfit for the imperial throne  after which Lothair became willing to negotiate a settlement   2  Provisions  Each of the three brothers was already established in one kingdom  Lothair in Italy  Louis the German in Bavaria  and Charles the Bald in Aquitaine  In the settlement  Lothair  who had been named co emperor in 817  retained his title as emperor and   Lothar received the central portion of the empire which later became  from north to south  the Low Countries  Lorraine  Alsace  Burgundy  Provence  and the Kingdom of Italy  which covered only the northern half of the Italian Peninsula   collectively called Middle Francia  He also received the two imperial cities  Aachen and Rome  In addition  he received the imperial title  but it conferred only nominal overlordship of his brothers  lands   Louis the German received the eastern portion  Louis was guaranteed the kingship of all lands to the east of the Rhine and to the north and east of Italy  which was called East Francia which eventually became the high medieval kingdom of Germany  the largest component of the Holy Roman Empire   Charles the Bald received the western portion  which later became France  Pepin II was granted the kingdom of Aquitaine  but only under the authority of Charles  Charles received all lands west of the Rhône  which was called West Francia  After the death of Lothair in 855  Upper and Lower Burgundy  Arles and Provence  passed to his third son Charles of Provence  and the remaining territory north of the Alps to his second son Lothair II  after whom the hitherto nameless territory was called Lotharingia  which name eventually evolved into the modern Lorraine  Lothair s eldest son  Louis II inherited Italy and his father s claim to the Imperial title   3  Legacy  The division reflected an adherence to the old Frankish custom of partible or divisible inheritance amongst a ruler s sons  rather than primogeniture  i e   inheritance by the eldest son  which would soon be adopted by both Frankish kingdoms   The division of the Frankish realm by the Treaty of Verdun  carried out without any regard to linguistic and cultural continuities  resulted in conflicts in Western Europe until the 20th century  Since the Middle Frankish Kingdom combined lengthy and vulnerable land borders with poor internal communications as it was severed by the Alps  it was not a viable entity and soon fragmented  This made it difficult for a single ruler to reassemble Charlemagne s empire  Only Charles the Fat achieved this briefly   In 855  the northern section became fragile Lotharingia  which became disputed by the more powerful states that evolved out of West Francia  i e   France  and East Francia  i e   Germany   Generations of kings of France and Germany were unable to establish a firm rule over Lothair’s kingdom  While the north of Lotharingia now comprises independent countries  the southern third of Lotharingia ended up a French  rather than German  territory in 1918  more than a thousand years after the Treaty of Verdun  The collapse of the Middle Frankish Kingdom also compounded the disunity of the Italian Peninsula  which persisted into the 19th century   4  See also  Oaths of Strasbourg  Treaty of Prüm  Treaty of Meerssen  Treaty of Ribemont  5  Notes  6  External links
