Niue     Niuean  Niuē  is an island country in the South Pacific Ocean  northeast of New Zealand within the triangle formed by Tonga to the west  Samoa to the north  and the Cook Islands to the east  Its land area is and its population  predominantly Polynesian  is around 1 400  They commonly refer to the island as  The Rock   a reference to the traditional name  Rock of Polynesia    Niue  whose capital city is Alofi  is a self governing state in free association with New Zealand  and most of its diplomatic relations are conducted by New Zealand on its behalf  Niueans are New Zealand citizens  and Queen Elizabeth II is head of state in her capacity as Queen of New Zealand  90–95% of Niuean people live in New Zealand  along with about 70% of the speakers of the Niuean language   Niue is not a member of the United Nations  but its status as a freely associated state has been accepted by UN organisations as equivalent to independence for international law purposes  Niue is a member of some UN specialized agencies   In 2003  Niue became the world s first  Wi Fi nation   in which free wireless Internet access is provided throughout the country by the Internet Users Society Niue   1  History  Niue was settled by Polynesians from Samoa around 900 AD  Further settlers arrived from Tonga in the 16th century   Until the beginning of the 18th century  there appears to have been no national government or national leader  chiefs and heads of families exercised authority over segments of the population  Around 1700  the concept and practice of kingship appear to have been introduced through contact with Samoa or Tonga  A succession of patu iki  kings  ruled  the first of whom was Puni mata  Tui toga  who reigned from 1875 to 1887  was the first Christian king   The first European to sight Niue was Captain James Cook in 1774  He made three attempts to land but was refused permission to do so by the inhabitants  He named the island  Savage Island  because  as legend has it  the natives who  greeted  him were painted in what appeared to be blood  The substance on their teeth was hulahula  a native red banana   For the next couple of centuries  Niue was known as Savage Island until its original name  Niuē  which translates as  behold the coconut   regained use   The next notable European visitors were from the London Missionary Society  which arrived in 1846 on the  Messenger of Peace   After many years of trying to land a European missionary  a Niuean named Nukai Peniamina was taken to Samoa and trained as a Pastor at the Malua Theological College  Peniamina returned as a missionary with the help of Toimata Fakafitifonua  He was finally allowed to land in Uluvehi Mutalau after a number of attempts in other villages had failed  The chiefs of Mutalau village allowed him to land and assigned over 60 warriors to protect him day and night at the fort in Fupiu   Christianity was first taught to the Mutalau people before it was spread to all the villages  originally other major villages opposed the introduction of Christianity and had sought to kill Peniamina  The people from the village of Hakupu  although the last village to receive Christianity  came and asked for a  word of god   hence  their village was renamed  Ha Kupu Atua  meaning  any word of god   or  Hakupu  for short   In 1889  the chiefs and rulers of Niue  in a letter to Queen Victoria  asked her  to stretch out towards us your mighty hand  that Niue may hide herself in it and be safe   After expressing anxiety lest some other nation should take possession of the island  the letter continued   We leave it with you to do as seems best to you  If you send the flag of Britain that is well  or if you send a Commissioner to reside among us  that will be well   The offer was not initially taken up by the British  In 1900 a petition by the Cook Islanders asking for annexation included Niue  if possible   In a document dated 19 October 1901  the  King  and Chiefs of Niue consented to  Queen Victoria taking possession of this island   A despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies from the Governor of New Zealand referred to the views expressed by the Chiefs in favour of  annexation  and to this document as  the deed of cession   A British Protectorate was declared  but it was short lived  Niue was brought within the boundaries of New Zealand on 11 June 1901 by the same Order and Proclamation as the Cook Islands  The Order limited the islands to which it related by reference to an area in the Pacific described by co ordinates  and Niue  the situation of which is 19 02 S   169 55 W  is within that area   Self government was granted by the New Zealand parliament with the 1974 constitution  following a referendum in 1974 whereby Niueans were given three options  independence  self government or continuation as a New Zealand territory  The majority selected self government and Niue s written constitution was promulgated as supreme law  Robert Rex  ethnically part European  part native  was appointed the first premier  a position he held until his death 18 years later  Rex was the first Niuean to receive a knighthood  in 1984   In January 2004  Niue was hit by Cyclone Heta which killed two people and caused extensive damage to the entire island  including wiping out most of the south of the capital  Alofi   2  Politics  The Niue Constitution Act vests executive authority in Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand and the Governor General of New Zealand  The Constitution specifies that in everyday practice sovereignty is exercised by the Niue Cabinet of Ministers  comprising the premier and three other ministers  The premier and ministers are members of the Niue Legislative Assembly  the nation s parliament   The assembly consists of 20 democratically elected members  14 of whom are elected by the electors of each village constituency  six by all registered voters in all constituencies  Electors must be New Zealand citizens  resident for at least three months  and candidates must be electors and resident for 12 months  Everyone born in Niue must register on the electoral roll   The Speaker is elected by the assembly and is the first official to be elected in the first sitting of the Legislative Assembly following an election  The Speaker calls for nominations for premier  the candidate with the most votes from the 20 members is elected  The premier selects three other members to form the Cabinet of Ministers  the executive arm of government  The other two organs of government  following the Westminster model  are the Legislative Assembly and the Judiciary  General elections take place every three years  most recently on 12 April 2014   The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature  There are a High Court and a Court of Appeal  with appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London   3  Geography  Niue is a 269 km² raised coral atoll in the southern Pacific Ocean  east of Tonga  The geographic co ordinates are   There are three outlying coral reefs within the Exclusive Economic Zone  with no land area   Beveridge Reef  at 20°00′S  167°48′W  240 km southeast  submerged atoll drying during low tide  9 5 km north south  7 5 km East West  total area 56 km²  no land area  lagoon 11 metres deep  Antiope Reef  at 18°15′S  168°24′W  180 km southeast  a circular plateau approximately 400 metres in diameter  with a least depth of 9 5 metres  Haran Reef  Harans Reef   at 21°33′S  168°55′W  reported to break furiously  294 km southeast Besides these  Albert Meyer Reef   20°53′S  172°19′W  almost 5 km long and wide  least depth 3 metres  326 km southwest  is not officially claimed by Niue  and the existence of Haymet Rocks   26°S  160°W  1273 km ESE  is in doubt   Niue is one of the world s largest coral islands  The terrain consists of steep limestone cliffs along the coast with a central plateau rising to about 60 metres above sea level  A coral reef surrounds the island  with the only major break in the reef being in the central western coast  close to the capital  Alofi  A notable feature is the number of limestone caves found close to the coast   The island is roughly oval in shape  with a diameter of about 18 kilometres   with two large bays indenting the western coast  Alofi Bay in the centre and Avatele Bay in the south  Between these is the promontory of Halagigie Point  A small peninsula  TePā Point  Blowhole Point   is close to the settlement of Avatele in the southwest  Most of the population resides close to the west coast  around the capital  and in the northwest   Some of the soils are geochemically very unusual  They are extremely highly weathered tropical soils  with high levels of iron and aluminium oxides  oxisol  and mercury  and they contain high levels of natural radioactivity  There is almost no uranium  but the radionucleides Th 230 and Pa 231 head the decay chains  This is the same distribution of elements as found naturally on very deep seabeds  but the geochemical evidence suggests that the origin of these elements is extreme weathering of coral and brief sea submergence 120 000 years ago  Endothermal upwelling  by which mild volcanic heat draws deep seawater up through the porous coral  may also contribute   No adverse health effects from the radioactivity or the other trace elements have been demonstrated  and calculations show that the level of radioactivity is probably much too low to be detected in the population  These unusual soils are very rich in phosphate  but it is not accessible to plants  being in the very insoluble form of iron phosphate  or crandallite  It is thought that similar radioactive soils may exist on Lifou and Mare near New Caledonia  and Rennell in the Solomon Islands  but no other locations are known   According to the World Health Organization  residents are evidently very susceptible to skin cancer  In 2002 Niue reported 2 482 deaths per 100 000 people – far higher than any other country   Niue is separated from New Zealand by the International Date Line  The time difference is 23 hours during the Southern Hemisphere winter and 24 hours when New Zealand uses Daylight Saving Time   3 1  Climate  The island has a tropical climate  with most rainfall occurring between November and April   4  Defence and foreign affairs  Niue has been self governing in free association with New Zealand since 3 September 1974 when the people endorsed the Constitution in a plebiscite  Niue is fully responsible for its internal affairs  Niue s position concerning its external relations is less clear cut  Section 6 of the Niue Constitution Act provides that   Nothing in this Act or in the Constitution shall affect the responsibilities of Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand for the external affairs and defence of Niue   Section 8 elaborates but still leaves the position unclear   Effect shall be given to the provisions of sections 6 and 7  concerning external affairs and defence and economic and administrative assistance respectively  of this Act  and to any other aspect of the relationship between New Zealand and Niue which may from time to time call for positive co operation between New Zealand and Niue after consultation between the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the Premier of Niue  and in accordance with the policies of their respective Governments  and  if it appears desirable that any provision be made in the law of Niue to carry out these policies  that provision may be made in the manner prescribed in the Constitution  but not otherwise   Niue has a representative mission in Wellington  New Zealand  It is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum and a number of regional and international agencies  It is not a member of the United Nations  but is a state party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  the Ottawa Treaty and the Treaty of Rarotonga  The country is a member state of UNESCO since 26 October 1993   Traditionally  Niue s foreign relations and defence have been regarded as the responsibility of New Zealand  However  in recent years Niue has begun to follow its own foreign relations  independent of New Zealand  in some spheres  It established diplomatic relations with the People s Republic of China on 12 December 2007  The Joint Communique signed by Niue and China is different in its treatment of the Taiwan question from that agreed by New Zealand and China  New Zealand  acknowledged  China s position on Taiwan but has never expressly agreed with it  but Niue  recognises that there is only one China in the world  the Government of the People s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of China   Niue established diplomatic relations with India on 30 August 2012  Niue s decision to follow independent foreign policy objectives has been the subject of occasional criticism in the New Zealand press  On 10 June 2014 the Government of Niue Press Release   Niue has now signed new diplomatic relations with Turkey  Honourable Minister of Infrastructure Dalton Tagelagi formalised the agreement over the weekend at the Pacific Small Island States  Foreign Ministers meeting in Istanbul  Turkey  The Memorandum of Understanding with Turkey  increases Niues foreign relationship with international countries that include  Peoples Republic of China  India  Australia  Thailand  Samoa  Cook Islands and Singapore  –  The people of Niue have fought as part of the New Zealand army  In World War I  Niue sent about 200 soldiers as part of the Maori Battalion under New Zealand forces   Niue is not a republic but its full name was listed as  the Republic of Niue  for a number of years on the ISO list of country names  ISO 3166 1   In its newsletter of 14 July 2011  the ISO acknowledged that this was a mistake and the words  the Republic of  were deleted from the ISO list of country names   5  Economy  Niue s economy is small  with a GDP of NZ$17 million in 2003  or US$10 million at purchasing power parity  The GDP has since grown to NZ$25 5 million as of 2009  Most economic activity revolves around the government  as the government has been in charge of organising and managing the affairs of the country since 1974  However  since the economy has reached a stage where state regulation may now give way to the private sector  there is an ongoing effort to develop the private sector  Following Cyclone Heta  the government made a major commitment towards rehabilitating and developing the private sector   The government allocated $1 million for the private sector  which was spent on helping businesses devastated by the cyclone  and on the construction of the Fonuakula Industrial Park  This industrial park is now completed and some businesses are already operating from it  The Fonuakula Industrial Park is managed by the Niue Chamber of Commerce  a not for profit organisation providing advisory services to businesses   Most families grow their own food crops for subsistence and some are sold at the Niue Makete in Alofi  some exported to their families in New Zealand  The taro is known in Samoa as  talo Niue  and in international markets as pink taro  Niue exports taro to New Zealand  The Niue taro is a natural variety and is very resistant to pests   The government and the Reef Group from New Zealand started two joint ventures in 2003 and 2004 involving the development of the fisheries and noni  Morinda citrifolia  a small tree with edible fruit   Niue Fish Processors  Ltd is a joint venture company processing fresh fish  mainly tuna  yellow fin  big eye and albacore   for export to the overseas markets  NFP operates out of their state of the art fish plant in Amanau Alofi South  completed and opened in October 2004   In August 2005  an Australian mining company  Yamarna Goldfields  suggested that Niue might have the world s largest deposit of uranium  By early September these hopes were seen as overoptimistic  and in late October the company cancelled its plans to mine  announcing that exploration drilling had identified nothing of commercial value  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission filed charges in January 2007 against two directors of the company  now called Mining Projects Group Ltd  alleging that their conduct was deceptive and they engaged in insider trading  This case was settled out of court in July 2008  both sides withdrawing their claims  There is an Australian company that had been issued a mineral prospecting license in the early 1970s which is still very active in doing research and collecting data on potential mineral deposits on Niue   Remittances from expatriates were a major source of foreign exchange in the 1970s and early 1980s  Continuous migration to New Zealand has shifted most members of nuclear and extended families there  removing the need to send remittances back home  In the late 1990s  PFTAC conducted studies on the balance of payments  which confirmed that Niueans are receiving little remittances but are sending more money overseas  mainly for paying for imported goods and for the education of students sent to study in New Zealand   Foreign aid  principally from New Zealand  has been Niue s principal source of income  Although most aid comes from New Zealand  it is currently losing NZ$250 000 a year  i e  reduction in New Zealand funding   meaning the country will come to rely more upon its own economy   Government expenses consistently exceed revenue to a substantial degree  with aid from New Zealand subsidising public service payrolls  The government generates some revenue  mainly from income tax  import tax and the lease of phone lines  The government briefly flirted with the creation of  offshore banking   but  under pressure from the US Treasury  agreed to end its support for schemes designed to minimise tax in countries like New Zealand  Niue provides automated Companies Registration  administered by the New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development  The Niue Legislative Assembly passed the Niue Consumption Tax Act in the first week of February 2009  and the 12 5% tax on good and services was expected to come into effect on 1 April 2009  Income tax has been lowered  and import tax may be reset to zero except for  sin  items like tobacco  alcohol and soft drinks  Tax on secondary income has been lowered from 35% to 10%  with the stated goal of fostering increased labour productivity   In 1997  the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority  IANA   under contract with the US Department of Commerce  assigned the Internet Users Society Niue  IUS N   a private charity  as manager of the  nu top level domain on the Internet  IUS N s charitable purpose was – and continues to be – to use revenue from registering  nu domain names to fund low cost or free Internet services for the people of Niue  In a letter to ICANN in 2007  IUS N s independent auditors reported IUS N had invested US$3 million for Internet services in Niue between 1999 and 2005 from  nu domain name registration revenue during that period  In 1999  IUS N and the Government of Niue signed an agreement whereby the Government recognised that IUS N managed the  nu ccTLD under IANA s authority and IUS N committed to provide free Internet services to government departments as well as to Niue s private citizens  A newly elected Government later disputed that agreement and attempted to assert a claim on the domain name  including a requirement for IUS N to make direct payments of compensation to the Government  In 2005  a Government appointed Commission of Inquiry into the dispute released its report  which found no merit in the government s claims  the government subsequently dismissed the claims in 2007  Starting in 2003  IUS N began installing WiFi connections throughout the capital village of Alofi and in several nearby villages and schools  and has been expanding WiFi coverage into the outer villages since then  making Niue the first WiFi Nation  To assure security for Government departments  IUS N provides the government with a secure DSL connection to IUS N s satellite Internet link  at no cost   In 2003  the government made a commitment to develop and expand vanilla production with the support of NZAID  Vanilla has grown wild for a long time  Despite the setback caused by the devastation of Cyclone Heta in early 2004  there was ongoing work on vanilla production  The expansion plan started with the employment of the unemployed or underemployed labour force to help clear land  plant supporting trees and plant vanilla vines  The approach to accessing land includes planning to have each household plant a small plot of around half to to be cleared and planted with vanilla vines  There are a lot of planting materials for supporting trees to meet demand for the expansion of vanilla plantations  however there is a severe shortage of vanilla vines for planting stock  There is of course the existing vanilla vines  but cutting them for planting stock will reduce or stop the vanilla from producing beans  At the moment  the focus is in the areas of harvesting and marketing   The Niue Integrated Strategic Plan  NISP  is the national development plan  setting national priorities for development  Cyclone Heta took away about two years from the implementation of the NISP  while national efforts concentrate on the recovery efforts  In 2008  Niue had yet to fully recover from Cyclone Heta   In the area of trade  Niue is negotiating with other Pacific countries free trade agreements  PICTA Trade in Services  PICTA TIS   Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union  and PACER Plus with Australia and New Zealand  The Office of the Chief Trade Adviser  OCTA  has been set up to assist Niue and other Pacific countries in the negotiation of the PACER Plus   Niue uses the New Zealand dollar   5 1  Agriculture  Agriculture is very important to the lifestyle of Niueans and the economy  and around 204 square kilometres of the land area are available for agriculture  Subsistence agriculture is very much part of Niue s agriculture  where nearly all the households have plantations of taro  Taro is a staple food  and the pink taro now dominant in the taro markets in New Zealand and Australia is an intellectual property of Niue  This is one of the natural taro varieties on Niue  and has a strong resistance to pests   Tapioca or cassava  yams and kumaras also grow very well  as do different varieties of bananas  Copra  passionfruit and limes dominated exports in the 1970s  but in 2008 vanilla  noni and taro are the main export crops   Coconut crab  or uga is also part of the food chain  it lives in the forest and coastal areas   The last agricultural census was in 1989   5 2  Tourism  Tourism has been identified as one of the three priority economic sectors  the other two are fisheries and agriculture  for economic development  In 2006  estimated visitor expenditure reached $1 6 million making tourism a major export industry for Niue  Niue will continue to receive direct support from the government and overseas donor agencies  The only airport is Niue International Airport  Air New Zealand is the sole airline  flying twice a week from Auckland  There is a tourism development strategy to increase the number of rooms available to overseas tourists at a sustainable level  Niue is trying to attract foreign investors to invest in the tourism industry of Niue by offering import and company tax concessions as incentives   5 2 1  Sailing  The sailing season begins in May  Alofi Bay has many mooring buoys and yacht crews can stay at Niue Backpackers  The anchorage in Niue is one of the least protected anchorages in the South Pacific  Other challenging characteristics of the anchorage are a primarily coral bottom and lots of deep spots  But the mooring buoys are attached to seine floats that support the mooring lines away from seabed obstructions   6  Media  Niue has two broadcast media outlets  Television Niue and Radio Sunshine  managed and operated by the Broadcasting Corporation of Niue  and one newspaper  the Niue Star  The internet also provides opportunity for other news services like   talanet okakoa com   7  Information technology  The first computers were Apple machines brought in by the University of the South Pacific Extension Centre around the early 1980s  The Treasury Department computerised its general ledger in 1986 using NEC personal computers that were IBM PC XT compatible  The Census of Households and Population in 1986 was the first to be processed using a personal computer with the assistance of David Marshall  FAO Adviser on Agricultural Statistics  advising UNFPA Demographer Dr Lawrence Lewis and Niue Government Statistician Bill Vakaafi Motufoou to switch from using manual tabulation cards  In 1987 Statistics Niue got its new personal computer NEC PC AT use for processing the 1986 census data  personnel were sent on training in Japan and New Zealand to use the new computer  The first Computer Policy was developed and adopted in 1988  In 2003  Niue became the first territory to offer free wireless internet to all its inhabitants  In August 2008 it has been reported that all school students have what is known as the OLPC XO 1  a specialised laptop by the One Laptop per Child project designed for children in the developing world  Niue was also a location of tests for the OpenBTS project  which aims to deliver low cost GSM base stations built with open source software  In July 2011  Niue Telecom launched pre paid mobile services  Voice EDGE – 2 5G  as Rokcell Mobile based on the commercial GSM product of vendor Lemko  Three BTS sites will cover the nation  International roaming is not currently available  The fibre optic cable ring is now completed around the island  FTTC   Internet ADSL services were rolled out towards the end of 2011   8  Culture  Niue is the birthplace of New Zealand artist and writer John Pule  Author of The Shark That Ate the Sun  he also paints tapa cloth inspired designs on canvas  In 2005  he co wrote Hiapo  Past and Present in Niuean Barkcloth  a study of a traditional Niuean artform  with Australian writer and anthropologist Nicholas Thomas   Taoga Niue is a new Government Department responsible for the preservation of culture  tradition and heritage  Recognising its importance  the Government has added Taoga Niue as the sixth pillar of the Niue Integrated Strategic Plan  NISP    8 1  Religion  In the 2011 census  sixty seven percent of the population belonged to the Ekalesia Niue  a national Congregationalist body   Ten percent were Latter day Saints and ten percent were Catholics  Two percent were Jehovah s Witnesses  and a similar proportion had no religion   9  Renewable energy  The European Union is helping Niue convert to renewable energy  In July 2009 a solar panel system was installed  injecting about 50 kW into the Niue national power grid  This is nominal 6% of the average 833 kW electricity production  The solar panels are at Niue High School  20 kW   Niue Power Corporation office  1 7 kW  and the Niue Foou Hospital  30 kW   The EU funded grid connected PV systems are supplied under the REP 5 programme and were installed recently by the Niue Power Corporation on the roofs of the high school and the power station office and on ground mounted support structures in front of the hospital  They will be monitored and maintained by the NPC  In 2014 two additional solar power installations was added to the Niue national power grid  one funded under PALM5 of Japan is located outside of the Tuila power station – so far only this have battery storage  the other under European Union funding is located opposite the Niue Hanan International Airport Terminal   10  Sport  Despite being a small country  a number of sports are popular  Rugby union is the most popular sport  played by both men and women  Niue were the 2008 FORU Oceania Cup champions  Netball is played only by women  There is a nine hole golf course at Fonuakula  There is a lawn bowling green under construction  Association Football is a popular sport  as evidenced by the Niue Soccer Tournament  though the Niue national football team has played only two matches  Rugby league is also a popular sport   11  See also  Outline of Niue  Bibliography of Niue  Cuisine of Niue  Niuean diplomatic missions  Transportation in
