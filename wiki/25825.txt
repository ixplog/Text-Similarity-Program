Pinnacle Point  an archeological site found on the coast of South Africa  paleoanthropologists in 2000 found evidence that  between 170 000 and 40 000 years ago  Late Stone Age people were scraping and grinding ochre  a clay colored red by iron oxide  probably with the intention of using it to color their bodies   Red hematite powder was also found scattered around the remains at a grave site in a Zhoukoudian cave complex near Beijing  The site has evidence of habitation as early as 700 000 years ago  The hematite might have been used to symbolize blood in an offering to the dead   Red  black and white were the first colors used by artists in the Upper Paleolithic age  probably because natural pigments such as red ochre and iron oxide were readily available where early people lived  Madder  a plant whose root could be made into a red dye  grew widely in Europe  Africa and Asia  The cave of Altamira in Spain has a painting of a bison colored with red ochre that dates to between 15 000 and 16 500 BC   A red dye called Kermes was made beginning in the Neolithic Period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus Kermes  primarily Kermes vermilio  The insects live on the sap of certain trees  especially Kermes oak trees near the Mediterranean region  Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave burial at Adaoutse  Bouches du Rhône  Kermes from oak trees was later used by Romans  who imported it from Spain  A different variety  called Kermes of Armenia  was made from Kermes insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs  It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC  and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians   Kermes is also mentioned in the Bible  In the Book of Exodus  God instructs Moses to have the Israelites bring him an offering including cloth  of blue  and purple  and scarlet   The term used for scarlet in the 4th century Latin Vulgate version of the Bible passage is coccumque bis tinctum  meaning  colored twice with coccus   Coccus  from the ancient Greek Kokkos  means a tiny grain and is the term that was used in ancient times for the Kermes vermilio insect used to make the Kermes dye  This was also the origin of the expression  dyed in the grain    In ancient Egypt  red was associated with life  health  and victory  Egyptians would color themselves with red ochre during celebrations  Egyptian women used red ochre as a cosmetic to redden cheeks and lips and also used henna to color their hair and paint their nails   But  like many colors  it also had a negative association  with heat  destruction and evil  A prayer to god Isis said   Oh Isis  protect me from all things evil and red   The ancient Egyptians began manufacturing pigments in about 4000 BC  Red ochre was widely used as a pigment for wall paintings  particularly as the skin color of men  An ivory painter s palette found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun had small compartments with pigments of red ochre and five other colors  The Egyptians used the root of the rubia  or madder plant  to make a dye  later known as alizarin  and also used it to color white power to use as a pigment  which became known as madder lake  alizarin or alizarin crimson   In Ancient China  artisans were making red and black painted pottery as early as the Yangshao Culture period  5000 3000 BC   A red painted wooden bowl was found at a Neolithic site in Yuyao  Zhejiang  Other red painted ceremonial objects have been found at other sites dating to the Spring and Autumn period  770–221 BC    During the Han dynasty  200 BC to 200 AD  Chinese craftsmen made a red pigment  lead tetroxide  which they called ch ien tan  by heating lead white pigment  Like the Egyptians  they made a red dye from the madder plant to color silk fabric for gowns and used pigments colored with madder to make red lacquerware   Red lead or Lead tetroxide pigment was widely used as the red in Persian and Indian miniature paintings as well as in European art  where it was called minium   In India  the rubia plant has been used to make dye since ancient times  A piece of cotton dyed with rubia dated to the third millennium BC was found at an archaeological site at Mohenjo daro  It has been used by Indian monks and hermits for centuries to dye their robes   The early inhabitants of America had their own vivid crimson dye  made from the cochineal  an insect of the same family as the Kermes of Europe and the Middle East  which feeds on the Opuntia  or prickly pear cactus plant  Red dyed textiles from the Paracas culture  800–100 BC  have been found in tombs in Peru   Red also featured in the burials of royalty in the Maya city states  In the Tomb of the Red Queen inside Temple XIII in the ruined

stripes on holidays  and the bride at a wedding wore a red shawl  called a flammeum  Red was used to color statues and the skin of gladiators  Red was also the color associated with army  Roman soldiers wore red tunics  and officers wore a cloak called a paludamentum which  depending upon the quality of the dye  could be crimson  scarlet or purple  In Roman mythology red is associated with the god of war  Mars  The vexilloid of the Roman Empire had a red background with the letters SPQR in gold  A Roman general receiving a triumph had his entire body painted red in honor of his achievement   The Romans liked bright colors  and many Roman villas were decorated with vivid red murals  The pigment used for many of the murals was called vermilion  and it came from the mineral cinnabar  a common ore of mercury  It was one of the finest reds of ancient times – the paintings have retained their brightness for more than twenty centuries  The source of cinnabar for the Romans was a group of mines near Almadén  southwest of Madrid  in Spain  Working in the mines was extremely dangerous  since mercury is highly toxic  the miners were slaves or prisoners  and being sent to the cinnabar mines was a virtual death sentence  File KnossosFrescoRepro06827 jpg A restored mural  called The Prince of Lilies  from the Bronze Age Palace of Minos at Knossos on Crete File

Europe and the Roman Catholic Church adapted red as a color of majesty and authority  It also played an important part in the rituals of the Catholic Church   it symbolized the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs   and it associated the power of the kings with the sacred rituals of the Church   Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors  In Western Europe  Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority  and wore red shoes at his coronation  Kings  princes and  beginning in 1295  Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes  When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century  he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper  Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light  Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France  England and Germany  In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures  both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles   Red clothing was a sign of status and wealth  It was worn not only by cardinals and princes  but also by merchants  artisans and townpeople  particularly on holidays or special occasions  Red dye for the clothing of ordinary people was made from the roots of the rubia tinctorum  the madder plant  This color leaned toward brick red  and faded easily in the sun or during washing  The wealthy and aristicrats wore scarlet clothing dyed with kermes  or carmine  made from the carminic acid in tiny female scale insects  which lived on the leaves of oak trees in Eastern Europe and around the Mediterranean  The insects were gathered  dried  crushed  and boiled with different ingredients in a long and complicated process  which produced a brilliant scarlet   Brazilin was another popular red dye in the Middle Ages  It came from the Sapanwood tree  which grew in India  Malaysia and Sri Lanka  A similar tree  brazilwood  grew on the coast of South America  The red wood was ground into sawdust and mixed with an alkaline solution to make dye and pigment  It became one of the most profitable

the cloak or costume of Christ  the Virgin Mary  or another central figure  In Venice  Titian was the master of fine reds  particularly vermilion  he used many layers of pigment mixed with a semi transparent glaze  which let the light pass through  to create a more luminous color   During the Renaissance trade routes were opened to the New World  to Asia and the Middle East  and new varieties of red pigment and dye were imported into Europe  usually through Venice  Genoa or Seville  and Marseille  Venice was the major depot importing and manufacturing pigments for artists and dyers from the end of the 15th century  the catalog of a Venetian Vendecolori  or pigment seller  from 1534 included vermilion and kermes   There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities  The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye  it produced an orange red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans  For the wealthy  the dye used was Kermes  made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree  For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal  also known as Kermes vermilio or  Blood of Saint John   which was made from a related insect  the Margodes polonicus  It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes  The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the  Kermes  of Armenia  Armenian cochineal  also known as Persian kirmiz   made by collecting and crushing Porphyophora hamelii  an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses  The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color  called Venetian red  which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe  Its secret ingredient was arsenic  which brightened the color   But early in the 16th century  a brilliant new red appeared in Europe  When the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and his soldiers conquered the Aztec Empire in 1519 1521  they discovered slowly that the Aztecs had another treasure beside silver and gold  they had the tiny cochineal  a parasitic scale insect which lived on cactus plants  which  when dried and crushed  made a magnificent red  The cochineal in Mexico was closely related to the Kermes varieties of Europe  but unlike European Kermes  it could be harvested several times a year  and it was ten times stronger than the Kermes of Poland  It worked particularly well on silk  satin and other luxury textiles  In 1523 Cortes sent the first shipment to Spain  Soon cochineal began to arrive in European ports aboard convoys of Spanish galleons   At first the guilds of dyers in Venice and other cities banned cochineal to protect their local products  but the superior quality of cochineal dye made it impossible to resist  By the beginning of the 17th century it was the preferred luxury red for the clothing of cardinals  bankers  courtisans and aristocrats   The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments  made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum  kermes lake  made from kermes insects  and madder lake  made from the rubia tinctorum plant  With the arrival of cochineal  they had a third  carmine  which made a very fine crimson  though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully  It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries  including Rembrandt  Vermeer  Rubens  Anthony van Dyck  Diego Velázquez and Tintoretto  Later it was used by Thomas Gainsborough  Seurat and J M W

wore a red Phrygian cap  or liberty cap  modeled after the caps worn by freed slaves in Ancient Rome  During the height of the Reign of Terror  Women wearing red caps gathered around the guillotine to celebrate each execution  They were called the  Furies of the guillotine   The guillotines used during the Reign of Terror in 1792 and 1793 were painted red  or made of red wood  During the Reign of Terror a statue of a woman titled liberty  painted red  was placed in the square in front of the guillotine  After the end of the Reign of Terror  France went back to the blue  white and red tricolor  whose red was taken from the traditional color of Saint Denis  the Christian martyr and patron saint of Paris   In the mid 19th century  red became the color of a new political and social movement  socialism  It became the most common banner of the worker s movement  of the French Revolution of 1848  of the Paris Commune in 1870  and of socialist parties across Europe   see red flags and revolution section below    As the Industrial Revolution spread across Europe  chemists and manufacturers sought new red dyes that could be used for large scale manufacture of textiles  One popular color imported into Europe from Turkey and India in the 18th and early 19th century was Turkey red  known in France as rouge d Adrinople  Beginning in the 1740s  this bright red color was used to dye or print cotton textiles in England  the Netherlands and France  Turkey red used madder as the colorant  but the process was longer and more complicated  involving multiple soaking of the fabrics in lye  olive oil  sheep s dung  and other ingredients  The fabric was more expensive but resulted in a fine bright and lasting red  similar to carmine  perfectly suited to cotton  The fabric was widely exported from Europe to Africa  the Middle East and America  In 19th century America  it was widely used in making the traditional patchwork quilt   In 1826  the French chemist Pierre Jean Robiquet discovered the organic compound alizarin  the powerful coloring ingredient of the madder root  the most popular red dye of the time  In 1868  German chemists Carl Graebe and Liebermann were able to synthesize alizarin  and to produce it from coal tar  The synthetic red was cheaper and more lasting than the natural dye  and the plantation of madder in Europe and import of cochineal from Latin America soon almost completely ceased   The 19th century also saw the use of red in art to create specific emotions  not just to imitate nature  It saw the systematic study of color theory  and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other  These studies were avidly followed by arists such as Vincent van Gogh  Describing his painting  The Night Cafe  to his brother Theo in 1888  Van Gogh wrote   I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions  The hall is blood red and pale yellow  with a green billiard table in the center  and four lamps of lemon yellow  with rays of orange and green  Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens    File

has been an important color in Chinese culture  religion  industry  fashion and court ritual since ancient times  Silk was woven and dyed as early as the Han Dynasty  25–220 BC   China had a monopoly on the manufacture of silk until the 6th century AD  when it was introduced into the Byzantine Empire  In the 12th century  it was introduced into Europe   At the time of the Han Dynasty  Chinese red was a light red  but during the Tang Dynasty new dyes and pigments were discovered  The Chinese used several different plants to make red dyes  including the flowers of carthamus tinctorius  the thorns and stems of a variety of sorghum plant called Kao liang  and the wood of the sappanwood tree  For pigments  they used cinnabar  which produced the famous vermillion or  Chinese red  of Chinese laquerware   Red played an important role in Chinese philosophy  It was believed that the world was composed of five elements  metal  wood  water  fire and earth  and that each had a color  Red was associated with fire  Each Emperor chose the color that his fortune tellers believed would bring the most prosperity and good fortune to his reign  During the Zhou  Han  Jin  Song and Ming Dynasties  red considered a noble color  and it was featured in all court ceremonies  from coronations to sacrificial offerings  and weddings   Red was also a badge of rank  During the Song Dynasty  906–1279   officials of the top three ranks wore purple clothes  those of the fourth and fifth wore bright red  those of the sixth and seventh wore green  and the eighth and ninth wore blue  Red was the color worn by the royal guards of honor  and the color of the carriages of the imperial family  When the imperial family traveled  their servants and accompanying officials carried red and purple umbrellas  Of an official who had talent and ambition  it was said  he is so red he becomes purple    Red was also featured in Chinese Imperial architecture  In the Tang and Song Dynasties  gates of palaces were usually painted red  and nobles often painted their entire mansion red  One of the most famous works of Chinese literature  A Dream of Red Mansions by Cao Xueqin  1715–1763   was about the lives of noble women who passed their lives out of public sight within the walls of such mansions  In later dynasties red was reserved for the walls of temples and imperial residences  When the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty conquered the Ming and took over the Forbidden City and Imperial Palace in Beijing  all the walls  gates  beams and pillars were painted in red and gold   Red is not often used in traditional Chinese paintings  which are usually black ink on white paper with a little green sometimes added for trees or plants  but the round or square seals which contain the name of the artist are traditionally red   File Woven silk  Western Han Dynasty jpg  Woven silk from the Western Han Dynasty  2nd century BC  File Gaozong Of Song jpg Emperors of China usually wore ceremonial costumes

the color of Revolution  it was the color of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and of the Chinese Revolution of 1949  and later of the Cultural Revolution  Red was the color of Communist Parties from Eastern Europe to Cuba to Vietnam   In the late 19th and early 20th century  the German chemical industry invented two new synthetic red pigments  cadmium red  which was the color of natural vermilion  and mars red  which was a synthetic red ochre  the color of the very first natural red pigment   The French painter Henri Matisse  1869–1954  was one of the first prominent painters to use the new cadmium red  He even tried  without success  to persuade the older and more traditional Renoir  his neighbor in the south of France  to switch from vermilion to cadmium red   Matisse was also one of the first 20th century artists to make color the central element of the painting  chosen to evoke emotions   A certain blue penetrates your soul   he wrote   A certain red affects your blood pressure   He also was familiar with the way that complementary colors  such as red and green  strengthened each other when they were placed next to each other  He wrote   My choice of colors is not based on scientific theory  it is based on observation  upon feelings  upon the real nature of each experience     I just try to find a color which corresponds to my feelings    Later in the century  the American artist Mark Rothko  1903–1970  also used red  in even simpler form  in blocks of dark  somber color on large canvases  to inspire deep emotions  Rothko observed that color was  only an instrument   his interest was  in expressing human emotions tragedy  ecstasy  doom  and so on    Rothko also began using the new synthetic pigments  but not always with happy results  In 1962 he donated to Harvard University a series of large murals of the Passion of Christ whose predominant colors were dark pink and deep crimson  He mixed mostly traditional colors to make the pink and crimson  synthetic ultramarine  cerulean blue  and titanium white  but he also used two new organic reds  Naphtol and Lithol  The Naphtol did well  but the Lithol slowly changed color when exposed to light  Within five years the deep pinks and reds had begun to turn light blue  and by 1979 the paintings were ruined and had to be taken down   File Bathing of a Red Horse  Petrov Vodkin  jpg Bathing

red lake  crimson lake or carmine lake  was an important red pigment in Renaissance and Baroque art  Since it was translucent  thin layers of red lac were built up or glazed over a more opaque dark color to create a particularly deep and vivid color   Unlike vermilion or red ochre  made from minerals  red lake pigments are made by mixing organic dyes  made from insects or plants  with white chalk or alum  Red lac was made from the gum lac  the dark red resinous substance secreted by various scale insects  particularly the Laccifer lacca from India  Carmine lake was made from the cochineal insect from Central and South America  Kermes lake came from a different scale insect  kermes vermilio  which thrived on oak trees around the Mediterranean  Other red lakes were made from the rose madder plant and from the brazilwood tree   Red lake pigments were an important part of the palette of 16th century Venetian painters  particularly Titian  but they were used in all periods  Since the red lakes were made from organic dyes  they tended to be fugitive  becoming unstable and fading when exposed to sunlight   4 2  Food coloring  The most common synthetic food coloring today is Allura Red AC is a red azo dye that goes by several names including  Allura Red  Food Red 17  C I  16035  FD&C Red 40  It was originally manufactured from coal tar  but now is mostly made from petroleum   In Europe  Allura Red AC is not recommended for consumption by children  It is banned in Denmark  Belgium  France and Switzerland  and was also banned in Sweden until the country joined the European Union in 1994  The European Union approves Allura Red AC as a food colorant  but EU countries  local laws banning food colorants are preserved   In the United States  Allura Red AC is approved by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  for use in cosmetics  drugs  and food  It is used in some tattoo inks and is used in many products  such as soft drinks  children s medications  and cotton candy  On June 30  2010  the Center for Science in the Public Interest  CSPI  called for the FDA to ban Red 40   Because of public concerns about possible health risks associated with synthetic dyes  many companies have switched to using natural pigments such as carmine  made from crushing the tiny female cochineal insect  This insect  originating in Mexico and Central American  was used to make the brilliant scarlet dyes of the European Renaissance   5  In science  5 1  Seeing red  The human eye sees red when it looks at light with a wavelength between 620 and 740 nanometers  Light just past this range is called infrared  or below red  and cannot be seen by human eyes  although it can be sensed as heat  In the language of optics  red is the color evoked by light that stimulates neither the S or the M  short and medium wavelength  cone cells of the retina  combined with a fading stimulation of the L  long wavelength  cone cells   Primates can distinguish the full range of the colors of the spectrum visible to humans  but many kinds of mammals  such as dogs and cattle  have dichromacy  which means they can see blues and yellows  but cannot distinguish red and green  both are seen as gray   Bulls  for instance  cannot see the red color of the cape of a bullfighter  but they are agitated by its movement   See color vision    One theory for why primates developed sensitivity to red is that it allowed ripe fruit to be distinguished from unripe fruit and inedible vegetation  This may have driven further adaptations by species taking advantage of this new ability  such as the emergence of red faces   Red light is used to help adapt night vision in low light or night time  as the rod cells in the human eye are not sensitive to red   Red illumination was  and sometimes still is  used as a safelight while working in a darkroom as it does not expose most photographic paper and some films  Today modern darkrooms usually use an amber safelight   5 2  In color theory and on a computer screen  On the color wheel long used by painters  and in traditional color theory  red is one of the three primary colors  along with blue and yellow  Painters in the Renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet  Cennino Cennini  in his 15th century manual on painting  wrote   If you wish to make a pretty violet color  take fine lac  Red lake  and ultramarine blue  in equal parts   he noted that it could also be made by mixing blue indigo and red hematite   In modern color theory  also known as the RGB color model  red  green and blue are additive primary colors  Red  green and blue light combined together makes white light  and these three colors  combined in different mixtures  can produce nearly any other color  This is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television  For example  purple on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet  but using additive colors and light instead of pigment  it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen  Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way  but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light   So that the maximum number of colors can be accurately reproduced on your computer screen  each color has been given a code number  or sRGB  which tells your computer the intensity of the red  green and blue components of that color  The intensity of each component is measured on a scale of zero to 255  which means the complete list includes 16 777 216 distinct colors and shades  The sRGB number of pure red  for example  is 255  00  00  which means the red component is at its maximum intensity  and there is no green or blue  The sRGB number for crimson is 220  20  60  which means that the red is slightly less intense and therefore darker  there is some green  which leans it toward orange  and there is a larger amount of blue which makes it slightly blue violet    See Web colors and RGB color model  File Boutet 1708 color circles jpg In a traditional color wheel from 1708  red  yellow and blue are primary colors  Red and

green and blue light in varying proportions makes all the colors on your computer screen and television screen  File RGB pixels jpg Tiny Red  green and blue sub pixels  enlarged on left side of image  create the colors you see on your computer screen and TV   5 3  Why the sunset is red  As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to the eye  some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles due to Rayleigh scattering  changing the final color of the beam that is seen  Colors with a shorter wavelength  such as blue and green  scatter more strongly  and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye  At sunrise and sunset  when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest  the blue and green components are removed almost completely  leaving the longer wavelength orange and red light  The remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles  which give the sky above the horizon its red glow   5 4  Lasers  Lasers emitting in the red region of the spectrum have been available since the invention of the ruby laser in 1960  In 1962 the red helium–neon laser was invented  and these two types of lasers were widely used in many scientific applications including holography  and in education  Red helium–neon lasers were used commercially in LaserDisc players  The use of red laser diodes became widespread with the commercial success of modern DVD players  which use a 660 nm laser diode technology  Today  red and red orange laser diodes are widely available to the public in the form of extremely inexpensive laser pointers  Portable  high powered versions are also available for various applications  More recently  671 nm diode pumped solid state  DPSS  lasers have been introduced to the market for all DPSS laser display systems  particle image velocimetry  Raman spectroscopy  and holography   Red s wavelength has been an important factor in laser technologies  red lasers  used in early compact disc technologies  are being replaced by blue lasers  as red s longer wavelength causes the laser s recordings to take up more space on the disc than would blue laser recordings   5 5  Astronomy  Mars is called the Red Planet because of the reddish color imparted to its surface by the abundant iron oxide present there   Astronomical objects that are moving away from the observer exhibit a Doppler red shift   Jupiter s surface displays a Great Red Spot caused by an oval shaped mega storm south of the planet s equator   Red giants are stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and switched to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell that surrounds its core  They have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than that of the Sun  However  their outer envelope is much lower in temperature  giving them an orange hue  Despite the lower energy density of their envelope  red giants are many times more luminous than the Sun due to their large size   Red supergiants like Betelgeuse and Antares are the biggest variety of red giants  They are huge in size  with radii 200 to 800 times greater than our Sun  but relatively cool in temperature  3500 4500 K   causing their distinct red tint  Because they are shrinking rapidly in size  they are surrounded by an envelope or skin much bigger than the star itself  The envelope of Betelgeuse is 250 times bigger than the star inside   A red dwarf is a small and relatively cool star  which has a mass of less than half that of the Sun and a surface temperature of less than 4 000 K  Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Galaxy  but due to their low luminosity  from Earth  none is visible to the naked eye  File Mars atmosphere

yellow  orange or blue  Some elements exhibit a red color when burned  calcium  for example  produces a brick red when combusted  File Candleburning jpg Red is commonly associated with flames and fire  but flames are almost always yellow  orange or blue  5 7  Autumn leaves  The red of autumn leaves is produced by pigments called Anthocyanins  They are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season  but are actively produced towards the end of summer  They develop in late summer in the sap of the cells of the leaf  and this development is the result of complex interactions of many influences—both inside and outside the plant  Their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of bright light as the level of phosphate in the leaf is reduced  During the summer growing season  phosphate is at a high level  It has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugars manufactured by chlorophyll  But in the fall  phosphate  along with the other chemicals and nutrients  moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant  When this happens  the sugar breakdown process changes  leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments  The brighter the light during this period  the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display  When the days of autumn are bright and cool  and the nights are chilly but not freezing  the brightest colorations usually develop   Anthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young leaves as they unfold from the buds in early spring  They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as cranberries  red apples  blueberries  cherries  strawberries  and plums   Anthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions  although in certain areas—most famously New England—up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment  In autumn forests they appear vivid in the maples  oaks  sourwood  sweetgums  dogwoods  tupelos  cherry trees and persimmons  These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids  colors to create the deeper orange  fiery reds  and bronzes typical of many hardwood species   See Autumn leaf color   File Maple leaves in October 2009 jpg The vivid reds of autumn leaves are produced by natural pigments called anthocyanins  They also produce the red of strawberries  apples  and plums  File Cranberries20101210 jpg Cranberries also get their red color from anthocyanins   5 8  Blood and other reds in nature  Oxygenated blood is red due to the presence of oxygenated hemoglobin   When used to describe natural animal coloration   red  usually refers to a brownish  reddish brown or ginger color  In this sense it is used to describe coat colors of reddish brown cattle and dogs  and in the names of various animal species or breeds such as red fox  red squirrel  red deer  European robin  red grouse  red knot  redstart  redwing  red setter  Red Devon cattle  etc  This reddish brown color is also meant when using the terms red ochre and red hair   The red herring dragged across a trail to destroy the scent gets its color from the heavy salting and slow smoking of the fish  which results in a warm  brown color   When used for flowers  red often refers to purplish  red deadnettle  red clover  red helleborine  or pink  red campion  red valerian  colors  File Agarplate redbloodcells edit jpg Red blood cell agar

of the human population  It occurs more frequently  2–6%  in people of northern or western European ancestry  and less frequently in other populations  Red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16 which causes a mutation in the MC1R protein   Red hair varies from a deep burgundy through burnt orange to bright copper  It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin  which also accounts for the red color of the lips  and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin  The term redhead  originally redd hede  has been in use since at least 1510  Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration  many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery tempered   See red hair    5 10  In animal and human behavior  Red is associated with dominance in a number of animal species  For example  in mandrills  red coloration of the face is greatest in alpha males  increasingly less prominent in lower ranking subordinates  and directly correlated with levels of testosterone  Red can also affect the perception of dominance by others  leading to significant differences in mortality  reproductive success and parental investment between individuals displaying red and those not  In humans  wearing red has been linked with increased performance in competitions  including professional sport and multiplayer video games  Controlled tests have demonstrated that wearing red does not increase performance or levels of testosterone during exercise  so the effect is likely to be produced by perceived rather than actual performance  Judges of tae kwon do have been shown to favor competitors wearing red protective gear over blue  and  when asked  a significant majority of people say that red abstract shapes are more  dominant    aggressive   and  likely to win a physical competition  than blue shapes  In contrast to its positive effect in physical competition and dominance behavior  exposure to red decreases performance in cognitive tasks and elicits aversion in psychological tests where subjects are placed in an  achievement  context  e g   taking an IQ test    6  Symbolism  6 1  Courage and sacrifice  Surveys show that red is the color most associated with courage  In western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice  particularly because of its association with blood  Beginning in the Middle Ages  the Pope and Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs  The banner of the Christian soldiers in the First Crusade was a red cross on a white field  the St  George s Cross  According to Christian tradition  Saint George was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor Diocletian  who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred  The Saint George s Cross became the Flag of England in the 16th century  and now is part of the Union Flag of the United Kingdom  as well as the Flag of the Republic of Georgia   In 1587  Mary  Queen of Scots  accused of treason against Queen Elizabeth I  wore a red shirt at her execution  to proclaim that she was an innocent martyr   The Thin Red Line was a famous incident in the Battle of Balaclava  1854  during the Crimean War  when a thin line of Scottish Highlander infantry  assisted by Royal Marines and Turkish infantrymen  repulsed a Russian cavalry charge  It was widely reported in the British press as an example of courage in the face of overwhelming odds and became a British military legend   In the 19th century novel The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane  a story about the American Civil War  the red badge was the blood from a wound  by which a soldier could prove his courage   File

associated with love  followed at a great distance by pink  It the symbolic color of the heart and the red rose  is closely associated with romantic love or courtly love and Saint Valentine s Day  Both the Greeks and the Hebrews considered red a symbol of love as well as sacrifice   The Roman de la Rose  the Romance of the Rose  a thirteenth century French poem  was one of the most popular works of literature of the Middle Ages  It was the allegorical search by the author for a red rose in an enclosed garden  symbolizing the woman he loved  and was a description of love in all of its aspects  Later  in the 19th century  British and French authors described a specific language of flowers  giving a single red rose meant  I love you    Saint Valentine  a Roman Catholic Bishop or priest who was martyred in about 296 AD  seems to have had no known connection with romantic love  but the day of his martyrdom on the Roman Catholic calendar  Saint Valentine s Day  February 14   became  in the 14th century  an occasion for lovers to send messages to each other  In recent years the celebration of Saint Valentine  s day has spread beyond Christian countries to Japan and China and other parts of the world  The celebration of Saint Valentine s Day is forbidden or strongly condemned in many Islamic countries  including Saudi Arabia  Pakistan and Iran  In Saudi Arabia  in 2002 and 2011  religious police banned the sale of all Valentine s Day items  telling shop workers to remove any red items  as the day is considered a Christian holiday  File Codex Manesse Bernger von

used to welcome distinguished guests  Red is also the traditional color of seats in opera houses and theaters  Scarlet academic gowns are worn by new Doctors of Philosophy at degree ceremonies at Oxford University and other schools  In China  it is considered the color of good fortune and prosperity  and it is the color traditionally worn by brides  In Christian countries  it is the color traditionally worn at Christmas by Santa Claus  because in the 4th century the historic Saint Nicholas was the Greek Christian Bishop of Myra  in modern day Turkey  and bishops then dressed in red

aggression  passion  heat and war  While red is the color most associated with love  it also the color most frequently associated with hatred  anger  aggression and war  People who are angry are said to  see red   Red is the color most commonly associated with passion and heat  In ancient times red was the color of Mars  the god of War  the planet Mars was named for him because of its red color   6 5  Warning and danger  Red is the traditional color of warning and danger  In the Middle Ages  a red flag announced that the defenders of a town or castle would fight to defend it  and a red flag hoisted by a warship meant they would show no mercy to their enemy  In Britain  in the early days of motoring  motor cars had to follow a man with a red flag who would warn horse drawn vehicles  before the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 abolished this law  In automobile races  the red flag is raised if there is danger to the drivers  In international football  a player who has made a serious violation of the rules is shown a red penalty card and ejected from the game   Several studies have indicated that red carries the strongest reaction of all the colors  with the level of reaction decreasing gradually with the colors orange  yellow  and white  respectively  For this reason  red is generally used as the highest level of warning  such as threat level of terrorist attack in the United States  In fact  teachers at a primary school in the UK have been told not to mark children s work in red ink because it encourages a  negative approach    Red is the international color of stop signs and stop lights on highways and intersections  It was standarized as the international color at the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968  It was chosen partly because red is the brightest color in daytime  next to orange   though it is less visible at twilight  when green is the most visible color  Red also stands out more clearly against a cool natural backdrop of blue sky  green trees or gray buildings  But it was mostly chosen as the color for stoplights and stop signs because of its universal association with danger and warning   File Vienna Convention road

The color that attracts attention  Red is the color that most attracts attention  Surveys show it is the color most frequently associated with visibility  proximity  and extroverts  It is also the color most associated with dynamism and activity   Red is used in modern fashion much as it was used in Medieval painting  to attract the eyes of the viewer to the person who is supposed to be the center of attention  People wearing red seem to be closer than those dressed in other colors  even if they are actually the same distance away  Monarchs  wives of Presidential candidates and other celebrities often wear red to be visible from a distance in a crowd  It is also commonly worn by lifeguards and others whose job requires them to be easily found   Because red attracts attention  it is frequently used in advertising  though studies show that people are less likely to read something printed in red because they know it is advertising  and because it is more difficult visually to read than black and white text  File Kate in Ottawa for Canada Day 2011 jpg The Duchess of Cambridge in Ottawa on Canada Day 2011 wearing the national colors of Canada  red and white   6 7  Seduction  sexuality and sin  Red by a large margin is the color most commonly associated with seduction  sexuality  eroticism and immorality  possibly because of its close connection with passion and with danger   Red was long seen as having a dark side  particularly in Christian theology  It was associated with sexual passion  anger  sin  and the devil  In the Old Testament of the Bible  the Book of Isaiah said   Though your sins be as scarlet  they shall be white as snow   In the New Testament  in the Book of Revelation  the Antichrist appears as a red monster  ridden by a woman dressed in scarlet  known as the Whore of Babylon    So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness  and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast  full of names of blasphemy  having seven heads and ten horns   And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour  and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls  having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication   And upon her forehead was a name written a mystery  Babylon the Great  the Mother of Harlots and of all the abominations of the earth  And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints  and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus   Satan is often depicted as colored red and or wearing a red costume in both iconography and popular culture  By the 20th century  the devil in red had become a folk character in legends and stories  In 1915  Irving Berlin wrote a song  At the Devil s Ball  and the devil in red appeared more often in cartoons and movies than in religious art   In 17th century New England  red was associated with adultery  In the 1850 novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne  The Scarlet Letter  set in a Puritan New England community  a woman is punished for adultery with ostracism  her sin represented by a red letter  A  sewn onto her clothes   Red is still commonly associated with prostitution  Prostitutes in many cities were required to wear red to announce their profession  and houses of prostitution displayed a red light  Beginning in the early 20th century  houses of prostitution were allowed only in certain specified neighborhoods  which became known as red light districts  Large red light districts are found today in Bangkok and Amsterdam   In Roman Catholicism  red represents wrath  one of the Seven Deadly Sins   In both Christian and Hebrew tradition  red is also sometimes associated with murder or guilt  with  having blood on one s hands   or  being caught red handed    File Whore of Babylon  XIV  jpg The Whore of Babylon  depicted in a

in general and Southern China specifically   It carries a largely positive connotation  being associated with courage  loyalty  honor  success  fortune  fertility  happiness  passion  and summer  In Chinese cultural traditions  red is associated with weddings  where brides traditionally wear red dresses  and red paper is frequently used to wrap gifts of money or other objects  Special red packets   in Mandarin or lai see in Cantonese  are specifically used during Chinese New Year celebrations for giving monetary gifts  On the more negative side  obituaries are traditionally written in red ink  and to write someone s name in red signals either cutting them out of one s life  or that they have died  Red is also associated with either the feminine or the masculine  yin and yang respectively   depending on the source  The Little Red Book  a collection of quotations from Chairman Mao Tse Tung  founding father of the People s Republic of China  PRC   was published in 1966 and widely distributed thereafter   In Japan  red is a traditional color for a heroic figure  In the Indian subcontinent  red is the traditional color of bridal dresses  and is frequently represented in the media as a symbolic color for married women  The color is associated with purity  as well as with sexuality in marital relationships through its connection to heat and fertility  It is also the color of wealth  beauty  and the goddess Lakshmi   In Central Africa  Ndembu warriors rub themselves with red paint during celebrations  Since their culture sees the color as a symbol of life and health  sick people are also painted with it  Like most Central African cultures  the Ndembu see red as ambivalent  better than black but not as good as white  In other parts of Africa  however  red is a color of mourning  representing death  Because red bears are associated with death in many parts of Africa  the Red Cross has changed its colors to green and white in parts of the continent   The early Ottoman Turks led by the first Ottoman Sultan  Osman I  carried red banners symbolizing sovereignty  Ghazis and Sufism  until  according to legend  he saw a new red flag in his dream inlaid with a crescent   7 1  Wedding dresses  In many Asian countries  red is the traditional color for a wedding dress today  symbolizing joy and good fortune   In India  brides traditionally wear a red sari  called the sari of blood  offered by their father  signifying that his duties as a father are transferred to the new husband  and as a symbol of his wish for her to have children  Once married  the bride will wear a sari with a red border  changing it to a white sari if her husband dies  In Pakistan and India  brides traditionally also have their hands and feet painted red with henna by the family of their new spouse  to bring happiness and signify their new status  File Traditional chinese wedding jpg The bride at a traditional Chinese wedding dresses in red  the color of happiness and

pentecost and the Holy Spirit  Since 1295  it is the color worn by Cardinals  the senior clergy of the Roman Catholic Church  Red is the liturgical color for the feasts of martyrs  representing the blood of those who suffered death for their faith  It is sometimes used as the liturgical color for Holy Week  including Palm Sunday and Good Friday  although this is a modern  20th century  development  In Catholic practice  it is also the liturgical color used to commemorate the Holy Spirit  for this reason it is worn at Pentecost and during Confirmation masses   Because of its association with martyrdom and the Spirit  it is also the color used to commemorate the Apostles  except for the Apostle St  John  who was not martyred  where white is used   and as such  it is used to commemorate bishops  who are the successors of the Apostles  for this reason  when funeral masses are held for bishops  cardinals  or popes  red is used instead of the white that would ordinarily be used    In Buddhism  red is one of the five colors which are said to have emanated from the Buddha when he attained enlightenment  or nirvana  It is particularly associated with the benefits of the practice of Buddhism  achievement  wisdom  virtue  fortune and dignity  It was also believed to have the power to resist evil  In China red was commonly used for the walls  pillars  and gates of temples   In the Shinto religion of Japan  the gateways of temples  called torii  are traditionally painted vermilion red and black  The torii symbolizes the passage from the profane world to a sacred place  The bridges in the gardens of Japanese temples are also painted red  and usually only temple bridges are red  not bridges in ordinary gardens   since they are also passages to sacred places  Red was also considered a color which could expel evil and disease  File Itsukushima torii angle jpg A Shinto torii at Itsukushima  Japan File John Paul II funeral long shot jpg Cardinals of the Roman
