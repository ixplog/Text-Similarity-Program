Loglan is a constructed language originally designed for linguistic research  particularly for investigating the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis  The language was developed beginning in 1955 by Dr James Cooke Brown with the goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true  In 1960 Scientific American published an article introducing the language  Loglan is the first among  and the main inspiration for  the languages known as logical languages  which also includes Lojban and Ceqli   Brown founded The Loglan Institute  TLI  to develop the language and other applications of it  He always considered the language an incomplete research project  and although he released many papers about its design  he continued to claim legal restrictions on its use  Because of this  a group of his followers later formed the Logical Language Group to create the language Lojban along the same principles  but with the intention to make it freely available and encourage its use as a real language   Supporters of Lojban use the term Loglan as a generic term to refer to both their own language  and Brown s Loglan  referred to as  TLI Loglan  when in need of disambiguation  Although the non trademarkability of the term Loglan was eventually upheld by the United States Patent and Trademark Office  many supporters and members of The Loglan Institute find this usage offensive  and reserve Loglan for the TLI version of the language   1  Grammar  Brown intended Loglan to be as culturally neutral as possible  and metaphysically parsimonious  which means that obligatory categories are kept to a minimum  An example of an obligatory category in English is the time tense of verbs  as it is impossible to express a finite verb without also expressing a tense   Also  Brown intended the language to be totally regular and unambiguous  In particular  phonemes that could be confused with each other were to be avoided   The language’s grammar is based on predicate logic  which is why it was named Loglan  an abbreviation for  logical language   This has been thought to make it suitable for human–computer communication  which led Robert A  Heinlein to mention the language in his science fiction novel The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress  1966   and as a fully fledged computer language in The Number of the Beast  1980    Loglan has no distinction between nouns and verbs  The predicate words can serve as verbs  nouns  adjectives or adverbs depending on where they occur in a sentence  Each predicate has its argument structure with places for arguments  which may be variables  For example  vedma   X sells Y to P for price Q   Prefixes allow one to reorder the argument structure of predicates  to emphasize one of the variables by putting it first  For example  to make price the first variable  use ju vedma  with the  little word  ju   Similarly  the sentence can be reordered to speak about seller  ware  or buyer  Modifications for time  location  actor  type of action  and others are provided by  little words  which are optional  Predicates can be compounded  a predicate can act as an argument of another predicate  when the former is prefixed by a  little word    The language is designed so that the patterns of phonemes always parse into words uniquely  Even when run together  the words can be separated in only one way  In Loglan  one can directly and precisely say any of the different meanings of the English phrase  a pretty little girls’ school   This feature is so pronounced that people fluent in Loglan say impossible things as a sort of joke—a type of humor not supported by the linguistic machinery of other languages  For example  in Loglan it is possible to say that John  a person  is literally a short word   Loglan has a wide range of words used for expressing emotions and attitudes about what one is saying  but unlike natural languages  these are kept clearly distinct from the actual statements being made   2  Alphabet and pronunciation  The alphabet of Loglan has two historical versions  In that of 1975 there were only 21 letters with their corresponding phonemes  In the final version of 1989 five more phonemes had been incorporated  letter H   h   was added to the alphabet in 1977 by popular demand  letter Y   ə   was added in 1982 to work as a kind of hyphen between the terms of a complex word  letters Q   θ    W   y   and X   x   were added in 1986 in order to allow the incorporation of the Linnaean vocabulary of biology  and they were useful to give more exact pronunciations to many borrowed names   The letters I and U when placed before vowels will represent the IPA sounds  j  and  w  respectively  For example  ie  je    what     ue  we    what   as an expression of surprise or interest    3  In popular culture  Loglan was mentioned in a couple of science fiction works  Robert A  Heinlein’s well known books  beginning with  Gulf  and including The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress and The Number of the Beast  and Robert Rimmer’s utopian book Love Me Tomorrow  1978    Loglan’s inventor  James Cooke Brown  also wrote a utopian science fiction novel The Troika Incident  1970  that uses Loglan phrases but calls the language a different name   Panlan    Loglan is used as the official interspecies language in the roleplaying game FTL
