The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football team based in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  They are members of the East Division of the National Football Conference  NFC  in the National Football League  NFL   The Eagles have won three NFL titles and made two Super Bowl appearances  losing both  in 1980 to the Oakland Raiders and 2004 to the New England Patriots    The club was established in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets  when a group led by Bert Bell secured the rights to an NFL franchise in Philadelphia  Throughout the team s history  Bell  Chuck Bednarik  Bob Brown  Reggie White  Steve Van Buren  Tommy McDonald  Greasy Neale  Pete Pihos  Sonny Jurgensen  and Norm Van Brocklin have been inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame   The team has an intense rivalry with the New York Giants  This rivalry is the oldest in the NFC East and is among the oldest in the NFL  It was ranked by NFL Network as the #1 rivalry of all time and Sports Illustrated has it amongst the top ten NFL rivalries of all time at #4  and according to ESPN  it is one of the fiercest and most well known rivalries in the football community  They also have a historic rivalry with the Washington Redskins  as well as their bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys   Eagles fans are among the most diehard and loyal in the NFL  They consistently rank in the top 3 in attendance and have sold out every game since the 1999 season  In a Sports Illustrated poll of 321 NFL players  Eagles fans were selected the most intimidating fans in the NFL   1  Franchise history  1 1  1931–60  Midway through the 1931 season  the Frankford Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and ceased operations  After more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement  the NFL granted an expansion franchise to a syndicate headed by Bert Bell and Lud Wray and awarded them the assets of the failed Yellow Jackets organization  The Bell Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3 500  equal to $ today  and assumed a total debt of $11 000 that was owed to three other NFL franchises  Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle insignia of the National Recovery Administration—the centerpiece of President Franklin D  Roosevelt s New Deal—Bell and Wray named the new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles  Neither the Eagles nor the NFL officially regard the two franchises as the same  citing the aforementioned period of dormancy  Furthermore  almost no Yellow Jackets players were on the Eagles  first roster  The Eagles  along with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the now defunct Cincinnati Reds  joined the NFL as expansion teams   In 1937  the Eagles moved to Shibe Park and played their home games at the stadium through 1947  except for the 1941 season  which was played at Municipal Stadium  where they had played from 1936 to 1939   Shibe Park was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1954    To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter  management set up stands in right field  parallel to Twentieth Street  Some twenty feet high  these  east stands  had twenty two rows of seats  The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field  The uncovered east stands enlarged capacity of Shibe Park to over thirty nine thousand  but the Eagles rarely drew more than twenty five to thirty thousand  The Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade  enduring repeated losing seasons  In 1943  when manpower shortages stemming from World War II made it impossible to fill the roster  the team merged with the Pittsburgh Steelers forming the  Phil Pitt Eagles  and were known as the  Steagles    The merger  never intended as a permanent arrangement  was dissolved at the end of the 1943 season   By the late 1940s  head coach Earle  Greasy  Neale and running back Steve Van Buren led the team to three consecutive NFL Championship Games  winning two of them in 1948 and 1949  Those two championships mark the Eagles as the only NFL team ever to win back to back championships by shutouts  defeating the Chicago Cardinals  7–0  in 1948—in a blizzard—and the Los Angeles Rams  14–0  in 1949   After the 1957 season  the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania  Franklin Field would seat over 60 000 for the Eagles  whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39 000  The stadium switched from grass to AstroTurf in 1969  It was the first NFL stadium to use artificial turf   In 1960  the Eagles won their third NFL championship  under the leadership of future Pro Football Hall of Famers Norm Van Brocklin and Chuck Bednarik  the head coach was Buck Shaw  The 1960 Eagles  by a score of 17–13  became the only team to defeat Vince Lombardi and his Green Bay Packers in the playoffs   1 2  1961–75  The Eagles had a good 1961 season and then fell on hard times in 1962  Jerry Wolman  after consulting his longtime friend Brandon Sturrock  bought the franchise in 1963 from the  Happy Hundred   a group of investors who owned the team from 1949–1963  for $5 505 000  equal to $ today    In 1969  Leonard Tose bought the Philadelphia Eagles from Wolman for $16 155 000  equal to $ today   then a record for a professional sports franchise  Tose s first official act was to fire Coach Joe Kuharich after a disappointing 24–41–1 record during his five year reign  He followed this by naming former Eagles receiving great Pete Retzlaff as General Manager and Jerry Williams as coach   With the merger of the NFL and AFL in 1970  the Eagles were placed in the NFC East Division with their archrivals the New York Giants  the Washington Redskins  and the Dallas Cowboys  Their heated rivalry with the Giants is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries  dating all the way back to 1933 and has been considered by writers in Philadelphia as one of the best rivalries in the NFL in the 21st century   1 3  1976–84  In   Dick Vermeil was hired from UCLA to coach the Eagles  who had only one winning season from 1962–1975  Starting in 1978  head coach Dick Vermeil and quarterback Ron Jaworski led the team to four consecutive playoff appearances   Vermeil s 1980 team won their first NFC East title  They were matched up against their hated rival the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship game  which they won 20–7  However  the Eagles lost to the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XV in 1981  The following year  the Eagles were eliminated in the wildcard round at home against the New York Giants  In the aftermath of the disappointing and strike shortened season of 1982  head coach Dick Vermeil resigned  claiming that he was  burned out   Vermeil was replaced by defensive coordinator Marion Campbell   In January 1983  Tose announced that his daughter  Susan Fletcher  the Eagles  vice president and legal counsel  would eventually succeed him as primary owner of the Eagles  Then in 1984  rumors were circulating that Leonard Tose was thinking about moving the team to Phoenix  Arizona due to financial reasons   1 4  1985–93  In 1985  Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to Norman Braman and Ed Leibowitz  highly successful automobile dealers from Florida  for a reported $65 million  equal to $ today  to pay off his more than $25 million  equal to $ today  in gambling debts at Atlantic City casinos   Philadelphia football struggled through the Marion Campbell years of the mid 1980s and was marked by a malaise in fan participation  However  in the 1985 Supplemental draft  the Eagles acquired the rights to Memphis Showboats  elite pass rusher Reggie White  In 1986  the arrival of head coach Buddy Ryan and his fiery attitude rejuvenated team performance and ignited the fan base  but the Eagles failed to win a playoff game during Ryan s tenure  Possibly the worst of these losses was the so called Fog Bowl in 1988 against the Chicago Bears  which happened to be Ryan s former team that he helped lead to a Super Bowl XX victory as defensive coordinator  Ryan was fired on January 7  1991 after an upset home playoff loss to the Redskins  Offensive coordinator Rich Kotite was promoted to head coach three days later   Kotite did lead the Eagles to one playoff victory against the New Orleans Saints during the 1992 season  yet his contract was not renewed after a disappointing 1994 season in which the Eagles went 7–9  losing their last seven games after starting the season 7–2  From 1988 to 1996  the Eagles qualified for the playoffs during 6 out of those 9 seasons  but they won the NFC East only once  in 1988  Among the team s offensive stars during that period were quarterback Randall Cunningham  tight end Keith Jackson  and running back Herschel Walker  But the  Gang Green  defense is possibly what defined the team  led by Reggie White  Jerome Brown  Clyde Simmons  Seth Joyner  Wes Hopkins  Mike Golic  Byron Evans  Eric Allen  Andre Waters and Mark McMillian   1 5  Lurie era  1994–present   Jeffrey Lurie bought the Eagles on May 6  1994 from then owner Norman Braman for an estimated $185 million  The club is now estimated to be the 17th most valuable sports team  worth $1 314 billion  as valuated in 2014 by Forbes   In 1999  the Eagles hired head coach Andy Reid and drafted quarterback Donovan McNabb  From 1999 until 2004  the team continually improved  returning to the playoffs in 2000  Moreover  the Eagles played in four straight NFC Championship Games between 2001 and 2004  After losing the NFC Championship in 2001 to the St  Louis Rams  in 2002 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers and in 2003 to the Carolina Panthers  the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX at the end of the 2004 season  where they lost to the New England Patriots  24–21  The Eagles have never won a title in the Super Bowl era   The team took a step back in 2005 with a 6–10 record  In 2006  the team earned its fifth NFC East title under Coach Reid and in 2008  the team won their 500th game   On January 11  2009  the team defeated the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants 23–11 en route to their 5th NFC Championship Game in 8 years and 5th in the 10 years the Eagles have been coached by Andy Reid  In the 2008 NFC Championship Game  the Eagles lost to the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 32–25  As of the conclusion of the 2012 season  during the Lurie era  the Eagles are 1–4 in conference championship games and 0–1 in Super Bowls   On August 13  2009  the Eagles signed quarterback Michael Vick  On December 6  2009  Andy Reid became only the 5th coach in NFL history to win 100 or more games with a single team in a single decade  The other four are Tom Landry  Don Shula  Tony Dungy  and Bill Belichick  all Super Bowl winners  With a record of 11–5 in 2009  the Eagles landed the sixth seed for the NFC playoffs  In the 2009 NFC Wild Card Game  the Eagles played against the Dallas Cowboys for the second consecutive week and lost 34–14   On April 4  2010  the team traded long time starting quarterback Donovan McNabb to the Washington Redskins in exchange for draft picks  Kevin Kolb was immediately named the starter  but after suffering a concussion in week 1 against the Packers  Vick took over as the starter  Vick led the Eagles to its sixth NFC East division title in ten seasons  With a record of 10–6 the Eagles clinched the 3rd seed and had to play a Wild Card Playoff Game  During the 2010 NFC Wild Card Game  the Eagles faced off against the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers and lost 21–16   The 2011 season for the Eagles was a major disappointment  as they only managed to finish 8–8 and did not qualify for the playoffs  although they did win the last 4 games of the season  Because of several free agent acquisitions  Vince Young  a back up quarterback  stated that the Eagles were a Dream Team  The Philadelphia fan base and faithful never did concur with the comment as some national outlets may comment  Many Eagles fans believe that Vince Young saying that the Eagles were a  Dream Team  is the reason that the Eagles had such a horrible season   Eagles fans had high expectations going into the 2012 season  The Eagles started off winning three out of their four first games  but that changed when they lost the next eight games  and were eliminated from the playoff hunt  They only won one out of their last four games  After a loss to the New York Giants on December 30  2012  Andy Reid was fired after fourteen seasons with the team  On January 16  2013  the Eagles brought in University of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly to succeed Reid as head coach after a 4–12 season   The Philadelphia Eagles named Michael Vick starting quarterback going into the 2013 season with much promise running Chip Kelly s fast paced spread offense   The 2013 season proved to be more successful for the Eagles  A hamstring injury took Michael Vick out  but his backup  Nick Foles  led the team to a 10 6 regular season record  and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons  Before throwing his first interception in Week 14  Foles threw 19 touchdowns  which was just one shy of the all time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season  set earlier in the season by Peyton Manning  Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single game with 7 against the Oakland Raiders which also made him the youngest player in history to throw that many touchdowns in a game  Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions giving him the best TD INTO ratio in NFL history  He also finished with a 119 0 passer rating  third highest in league history only behind Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004  He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect passer rating  LeSean McCoy finished his Pro Bowl season as the league s top rusher with 1 607 rushing yards  also a franchise record  and 2 146 total yards from scrimmage  also best in the NFL  As a whole  the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns  most in franchise history passing the previous season high set back in 1948   The Eagles opened the 2014 season winning their first three games and making NFL history as the only team ever to trail by ten or more points in their first three games and come back to win The Eagles have wins over the Jaguars  Colts  Redskins  Rams  Giants  Texans  Panthers  Titans  and Cowboys  After going 9 3 with the win over the Cowboys  the Eagles lost their next 3  including rematches against the Redskins and the Cowboys  and were eliminated from playoff contention with the Cowboys  win over the Colts   1 6  Season Records  Regular Season Record  all time    534 568 26 Playoff Record  all time    19 21

Rivalries  2 1  New York Giants  One of the NFL s oldest  this rivalry began on October 15  1933 when the Giants defeated the newly founded Eagles 56–0  The Giants lead the all time series 83–75–2  Three of the most well known comebacks against the Giants are labeled as  Miracle In The Meadowlands – Herm Edwards    Miracle In The Meadowlands II  Brian Westbrook  and  Miracle In The New Meadowlands – DeSean Jackson    2 2  Dallas Cowboys  Throughout the decades  the Cowboys have been one of the Eagles  biggest rivals  The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27–25 on September 30  1960  Dallas leads the all time series 63–49–0  It has been particularly noted for the strong level of hostility between the two teams  fan bases  with incidents such as the 1989 Bounty Bowls   2 3  Washington Redskins  Not as big as the rivalries between the Giants and Cowboys  the Washington Redskins are still in the NFC East division with the Eagles  The rivalry started in 1934 when the Washington Redskins were first known as the Boston Redskins  The Redskins defeated the Eagles 6 to 0  The Redskins lead the all time series 81–78–5   2 4  Pittsburgh Steelers  The Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933  From that season  through 1966  this was a major rivalry for both teams as both were part of the same division  In 1967  they were placed in separate divisions but remained in the same conference for three years  Finally  in 1970  the Steelers  along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts  moved to the American Football Conference while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old line NFL teams in the National Football Conference  As a result  the Eagles and Steelers no longer played every year  Currently they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season  with the next meeting in 2016  The Eagles lead the all time series 47–28–3   3  Logo and uniforms  Image Eagleslogo1948 png 1948

logo svg Primary Logo 1996–present Image Philadelphia Eagles logo primary svg Alternate Logo 1996–present  For several decades  the Eagles  colors were kelly green  silver  and white  In 1954  the Eagles  along with the Baltimore Colts  became the second team ever in the NFL to put a logo on their helmets  with silver wings on a kelly green helmet  In 1969  the team wore two helmet versions  Kelly green with white wings in road games  and white with kelly green wings at home  From 1970 to  73  they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings  By 1974  Joseph A  Scirrotto Jr  designed the silver wings took on a white outline  and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades   From 1948–95  the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws  although from  69–72  the eagle took on a more stylized look  As the design was similar to the Apollo 11 emblem  and its lunar module moon landing craft was dubbed Eagle  players wore the flight s mission patch on their jerseys during 1969   In 1973  the team s name was added below the eagle  which returned to its pre  69 look   However  both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996  The primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade  officially described as  midnight green   Silver was practically abandoned  as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green  The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color  with silver and black accents  The team s logo combination  the eagle and club name lettering  also changed in 1996  with the eagle itself limited to a white  bald eagle  head  drawn in a less realistic  more cartoon based style  and the lettering changing from calligraphic to block letters   Since the 1996 alterations  the team has made only minor alterations  mostly relating to jersey pant combinations worn during specific games  For example  in 1997  against the San Francisco 49ers  the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history  The second occasion was the final regular season game at Veterans Stadium  a win over the division rival Washington Redskins  And in the first two games of the 2003 season  both home losses to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots   The Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants  Since 2003  the white jerseys along with white pants have been worn during preseason games   The 2003 season also saw the first  though only subtle  change to the 1996 style uniform  On both white and green jerseys  black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering  The stripe on the pants changed from black green black to black silver green on the white pants  and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black  another of silver  with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants  The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys  with a green  instead of black  shadow on white numbers  and silver trim  These black jerseys have been worn for two selected home games each season  usually the first home game after bye week and season finale   In the 2003 and 2004 regular season home finales  the team wore the green road pants with the black alternate jerseys  but lost each game  Since then  the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants  However  due to the special 75th anniversary uniforms serving as the  alternates  for one game in 2007  the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules  alternate uniforms are permitted twice per season but only one can be used   However  the black jerseys with white pants re appeared for the 2008 Thanksgiving night game against the Arizona Cardinals  The black jerseys were most recently used in a November 29  2009 game against the Washington Redskins  Since 2006  the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game  but did not use them in 2007  2010  and 2011  For the 2007 and 2010 seasons  the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams  The team also started wearing black shoes exclusively in 2004   To celebrate the team s 75th anniversary  the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th season logo patch on the left shoulder  In addition  the team wore  throwback  jerseys in a 2007 game against the Detroit Lions  The yellow and blue jerseys  the same colors found on Philadelphia s city flag  are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team s inaugural season  and were the same colors used by the former Frankford Yellow Jackets franchise prior to their suspension of operations in 1931  The Eagles beat Detroit  56–21   The Philadelphia Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid October when the temperature is warmer  In night contests in the first half of the regular season  the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler  However  there have been exceptions  such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night  In late October or beginning in November  the Eagles start to wear their colors at home  although they have done it earlier before   be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey  On one occasion the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the Dallas Cowboys on November 4  2007 to make the Cowboys wear their road blue jerseys  Since moving to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003  the Eagles have worn white at home for at least their home opener  The Eagles have worn white for their home opener in every game since moving to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003  with the exceptions for the 2010 home opener  see next paragraph  and the 2011 home opener against the New York Giants  For the 2011 season  the Eagles did not wear white for any of their home games   In the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers  on September 12  2010  the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team   For the 2012 season Nike took over from Reebok as the NFL s official apparel licensee but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike s  Elite 51  uniform technology  Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo  the only other change is the league wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform  replacing the NFL Equipment logo   other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged  The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey   In the 2013 season  the Eagles started to primarily wear white pants with their white jerseys  They only wore green pants with white jerseys for three games  in the season opener at the Washington Redskins  the home opener against the San Diego Chargers  and in Week 4 at the Denver Broncos   For the 2014 season the Eagles have officially adopted the “Elite 51″ style uniform from Nike  Recently the team has discussed bringing back the  Kelly Green  uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season and which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs  Green Bay  Traditionally kelly green  silver and white had been the official team color until 1996 season when it switched to the current  Midnight Green  uniforms  But due to the NFL rules and restrictions having a team go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made  it would most likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made   In Week 6 against the New York Giants  the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys  giving them a blackout uniform set  the Eagles won the game 27 0  The victory was their first shutout in 18 years   4  Training camp  The Eagles previously held their preseason training camp from the end of July through mid August each year at Lehigh University in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley  With the addition of new head coach Chip Kelly  the Eagles recently moved their training camp to the NovaCare Complex in Philadelphia  Training camps were previously held at Chestnut Hill Academy in 1935  Saint Joseph s University in 1939 and 1943  Saranac Lake from 1946–1948  Hershey from 1951–1967  Albright College from 1968–1972  Widener University from 1973–1979  and West Chester University from 1980–1995   5  Fight song  This fight song is heard during Eagles  home games after touchdowns and before the team is introduced prior to kickoff   6  Fans  6 1  Devotion  Although the method may vary  studies that attempt to rank the 32 fan bases in the NFL consistently place Eagles fans among the best in the league  noting their  unmatched fervor   Eagles fans have numerous dedicated web communities  ranking the Eagles just behind the Phillies as the dominant Philadelphia sports presence on the web   The American City Business Journals  which conducts a regular study to determine the most loyal fans in the NFL  evaluates fans based primarily on attendance related factors  and ranked Eagles fans third in both 1999 and 2006  The 2006 study called the fans  incredibly loyal   noting that they filled 99 8 percent of the seats in the stadium over the previous decade  Forbes placed the Eagles fans first in its 2008 survey  which was based on the correlation between team performance and fan attendance  ESPN com placed Eagles fans fourth in the league in its 2008 survey  citing the connection between the team s performance and the mood of the city  The last home game which was blacked out on television in the Philadelphia market as a result of not being sold out was against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday  September 12  1999  which was Andy Reid s first home game as new head coach of the Eagles   The studies note that—win or lose—Eagles fans can be counted on to pack their stadium  As of August 2008  the team had sold out 71 consecutive games  and 70 000 were on the team s waiting list for season tickets  Despite finishing with a 6–10 record in the 2005–2006 season  the Eagles ranked second in the NFL in merchandise sales  and single game tickets for the next season were sold out minutes after phone and Internet lines opened   Eagles fans have also been known to chant the famous   E A G L E S – Eagles    at Flyers  Phillies  and Sixers games when the team is getting blown out late in a game and a loss is inevitable  signifying their displeasure with the given team s performance  and that they are instead putting their hope into the Eagles   6 2  Bad behavior  Along with their devotion Eagles fans were  however  also notorious for bad behavior  especially when the team played its rivals  In If Football s a Religion  Why Don t We Have a Prayer   Jereé Longman described the fans of 700 Level of Veterans Stadium as having a reputation for  hostile taunting  fighting  public urination and general strangeness   So many incidents occurred at a 1997 game against the 49ers that at the following home game Judge Seamus McCaffrey began presiding over a temporary courtroom at the stadium  20 suspects came before him that day  Fan behavior improved after the team s move to Lincoln Financial Field  and  Eagles Court  ended in December 2003   7  Eagles Cheerleaders  The team also has its own cheerleading squad  who performs a variety of dance moves for the fans and the Eagles on the sideline  The squad also releases a swimsuit calendar each year  and is the first squad in the league to release the calendar on the Android and iOS mobile systems   8  Charitable activity  8 1  Eagles Fly for Leukemia  Ronald McDonald Houses  In 1971  Kim Hill  the daughter of Eagles tight end Fred Hill  was diagnosed with leukemia  As Hill and his family dealt with this devastating blow  his teammates and owner Leonard Tose pledged their emotional support  As Hill continued to research his daughter s leukemia  the support of Leonard Tose and the Eagles continued to inspire him  The Eagles held fund raising dinners  the team made individual contributions  and Fred and Kim continued to bravely battle this disease  After Kim Hill s successful treatment  her father became committed to helping other families battle pediatric cancers  From helping them identify resources  to assisting financially  Fred Hill and his teammates continued their fight against childhood cancers  In 1972  Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose officially recognized Eagles Fly for Leukemia as the official philanthropy of the Philadelphia Eagles Football Club   The Philadelphia Eagles Helmet Cart sat at Joseph A  Scirrotto Jr  s  Designer of the 74 Helmet   Joe s Gulf Gas Station  at Rising Sun Ave & Van Kirk St  1974 off season year to raise money for  The Eagles Fly for Leukemia   where every weekend Eagles NFL Team Members joined to help raise awareness and funds   The Eagles and Leonard Tose established the first Ronald McDonald House  a place for families to find shelter when their children are sick  Now  over 200 Ronald McDonald houses shelter thousands of families around the world  The spirit continued  and over the last 30 years Eagles Fly for Leukemia has raised over $10 million towards pediatric cancer research and family support  In 1991  Eagles Fly for Leukemia soared higher and became established as a free standing non profit organization  outside of the Eagles Football Club   8 2  Eagles Youth Partnership  In 1995  in an effort to better give back to the community  Eagles Youth Partnership  EYP  was formed as a 501 c  3  public charity in the emerging field of sports philanthropy   Eagles Youth Partnership  EYP  serves over 50 000 low income children in the Greater Philadelphia region every year via two mobile units  the Eagles Eye Mobile  which gives eye examinations  and the Eagles Book Mobile  a literacy program  EYP is also known for annual playground builds in underserved neighborhoods  an annual chess tournament  and a variety of other programs and events  Since 2009 EYP has also staged a fan appreciation night entitled Eagles Flight Night  The night marks the Eagles first appearance of the season at Lincoln Financial Field  and is held in the form of a public practice   The Philadelphia Eagles Football Club is the EYP s largest funder  The Eagles also donate free office space  staff support and other resources in support of the organization  Corporate  foundation and individual donors join to support Eagles Youth Partnership s efforts   In December  2011  The Eagles  together with Eagles Youth Partnership  were recognized as best professional sports team in the world for their impact and leadership in the community  The Best Team award was bestowed by Beyond Sport  a London based organization that promotes the use of sport for social good internationally  The Eagles Eagles Youth Partnership were selected from among

cultural reference  The 1976 draw was the subject of the movie Invincible  The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as Vince Papale  a 30 year old bartender and part time school teacher  and also a diehard Eagles fan who became an Eagles player  The film differs slightly from true events as the selection process was invitation only  and Papale had at least some previous playing experience  The film Silver Linings Playbook highlights the 2008 Philadelphia Eagles season  The film was critically acclaimed and nominated for several awards including 8 Academy Awards   The award winning comedy series It s Always Sunny in Philadelphia starring Danny DeVito makes several references to the Philadelphia Eagles  most notably Season 3  Episode 2 –  The Gang Gets Invincible    15  See also  South
