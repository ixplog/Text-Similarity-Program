The Cramps were an American punk rock band  formed in 1976 and active until 2009  The band split after the death of lead singer Lux Interior  Their line up rotated much over their existence  with the husband and wife duo of Interior and lead guitarist and occasional bass guitarist Poison Ivy the only permanent members  The addition of band members guitarist Bryan Gregory and drummer Pam Ballam comprised the first complete lineup in April 1976   They were part of the early CBGB punk rock movement that had emerged in New York  The Cramps are noted as influencing a number of musical styles  not only were they one of the first garage punk bands  they are also widely recognized as one of the prime innovators of psychobilly   1  Style  Their music is mostly in rockabilly form  played at varying tempos  with a minimal drumkit  An integral part of the early Cramps sound is dual guitars  without a bassist  The focus of their songs  lyrical content and their image is camp humor  sexual double entendre  and retro horror sci fi b movie iconography   Their sound was heavily influenced by early rockabilly  rhythm and blues  and rock and roll like Link Wray and Hasil Adkins  1960s surf music acts such as The Ventures and Dick Dale  1960s garage rock artists like The Standells  The Gants  The Trashmen  The Green Fuz and The Sonics  as well as the post glam early punk scene from which they emerged  They also were influenced to a degree by the Ramones and Screamin  Jay Hawkins  who were an influence for their style of theatrical horror blues   In turn  The Cramps have influenced countless subsequent bands in the garage  punk and rockabilly revival subgenres  and helped create the psychobilly genre   Psychobilly  was a term coined by The Cramps  although Lux Interior maintained that the term did not describe their own style   2  History  2 1  1970s  Lux Interior  born Erick Lee Purkhiser  and Poison Ivy  born Kristy Marlana Wallace  met in Sacramento  California
