In optics  polarized light can be described using the Jones calculus  discovered by R  C  Jones in 1941  Polarized light is represented by a Jones vector  and linear optical elements are represented by Jones matrices  When light crosses an optical element the resulting polarization of the emerging light is found by taking the product of the Jones matrix of the optical element and the Jones vector of the incident light  Note that Jones calculus is only applicable to light that is already fully polarized  Light which is randomly polarized  partially polarized  or incoherent must be treated using Mueller calculus   1  Jones vectors  The Jones vector describes the polarization of light   The x and y components of the complex amplitude of the electric field of light travel along z direction  and   are represented as  Here is the Jones vector   is the imaginary unit with    Thus  the Jones vector represents  relative  amplitude and  relative  phase of electric field in x and y directions   The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the two components of Jones vectors is proportional to the intensity of light  It is common to normalize it to 1 at the starting point of calculation for simplification  It is also common to constrain the first component of the Jones vectors to be a real number  This discards the phase information needed for calculation of interference with other beams  Note that all Jones vectors and matrices on this page assumes that the phase of the light wave is   which is used by Hecht  In this definition  increase in  or   indicates retardation  delay  in phase  while decrease indicates advance in phase  For example  a Jones vectors component of    indicates retardation by  or 90 degree  compared to 1     Collett uses the opposite definition     The reader should be wary when consulting references on Jones calculus   The following table gives the 6 common examples of normalized Jones vectors   When applied to the Poincaré sphere  also known as the Bloch sphere   the basis kets   and   must be assigned to opposing  antipodal  pairs of the kets listed above  For example  one might assign   and     These assignments are arbitrary  Opposing pairs are  and  and  and The ket is a general vector that points to any place on the surface  Any point not in the table above and not on the circle that passes through is collectively known as elliptical polarization   2  Jones matrices  The Jones matrices are the operators that act on the Jones Vectors as listed above  These matrices are implemented by various optical elements such as lenses  beam splitters  mirrors  etc  The following table gives examples of Jones matrices for polarizers   3  Phase retarders  Phase retarders introduce a phase shift between the vertical and horizontal component of the field and thus change the polarization of the beam  Phase retarders are usually made out of birefringent uniaxial crystals such as calcite  MgF2 or quartz  Uniaxial crystals have one crystal axis that is different from the other two crystal axes  i e   ni ≠ nj   nk   This unique axis is called the extraordinary axis and is also referred to as the optic axis  An optic axis can be the fast or the slow axis for the crystal depending on the crystal at hand  Light travels with a higher phase velocity through an axis that has the smallest refractive index and this axis is called the fast axis  Similarly  an axis which has the highest refractive index is called a slow axis since the phase velocity of light is the lowest along this axis  Negative uniaxial crystals  e g   calcite CaCO3  sapphire Al2O3  have ne   no so for these crystals  the extraordinary axis  optic axis  is the fast axis whereas for positive uniaxial crystals  e g   quartz SiO2  magnesium fluoride MgF2  rutile TiO2   ne   n o and thus the extraordinary axis  optic axis  is the slow axis   Any phase retarder with fast axis vertical or horizontal has zero off diagonal terms and thus can be conveniently expressed as  where  and are the phases of the electric fields in and directions respectively  In the phase convention   the relative phase between the two waves when represented as suggests that a positive  i e       means that doesn t attain the same value as until a later time i e   leads   Similarly  if i e       leads   For e g   if the fast axis of a quarter wave plate is horizontal  this suggests that the phase velocity along the horizontal direction is faster than that in the vertical direction i e   leads   Thus  which for a quarter wave plate suggests that    In the opposite convention   the relative phase when defined as suggests that a positive means that doesn t attain the same value as until a later time i e   leads    The special expressions for the phase retarders can be obtained by using the general expression for a birefringent material  In the above expression   Phase retardation induced between and by a birefringent material is given by  is the orientation of the fast axis with respect to the x axis   is the circularity  For linear retarders    0 and for circular retarders    ±  2     4  For elliptical retarders  it takes on values between    2 and  2    4  Axially rotated elements  Assume an optical element has its optic axis perpendicular to the surface vector for the plane of incidence and is rotated about this surface vector by angle θ 2  i e   the principal plane  through which the optic axis passes  makes angle θ 2 with respect to the plane of polarization of the electric field of the incident TE wave   Recall that a half wave plate rotates polarization as twice the angle between incident polarization and optic axis  principal plane   Therefore  the Jones matrix for the rotated polarization state  M θ   is  This agrees with the expression for a half wave plate in the table above  These rotations are identical to beam unitary splitter transformation in optical physics given by  where the primed and unprimed coefficients represent beams incident from opposite sides of the beam splitter  The reflected and transmitted components acquire a phase θr and θt  respectively  The requirements for a valid representation of the element are  and  5  Arbitrarily rotated elements  This would involve a three dimensional rotation matrix  See Garam Yun for work done on this    6  See also  Mueller calculus
