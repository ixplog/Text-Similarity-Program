The theory of relativity  or simply relativity in physics  usually encompasses two theories by Albert Einstein  special relativity and general relativity   Concepts introduced by the theories of relativity include   Measurements of various quantities are relative to the velocities of observers  In particular  space contracts and time dilates   Spacetime  space and time should be considered together and in relation to each other   The speed of light is nonetheless invariant  the same for all observers  The term  theory of relativity  was based on the expression  relative theory     used in 1906 by Max Planck  who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity  In the discussion section of the same paper Alfred Bucherer used for the first time the expression  theory of relativity       1  Scope  The theory of relativity transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century  When first published  relativity superseded a 200 year old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton   In the field of physics  relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions  along with ushering in the nuclear age  With relativity  cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars  black holes  and gravitational waves   1 1  Two theory view  The theory of relativity was representative of more than a single new physical theory  There are some explanations for this  First  special relativity was published in 1905  and the final form of general relativity was published in 1916   Second  special relativity applies to elementary particles and their interactions  whereas general relativity applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm  including astronomy   Third  special relativity was accepted in the physics community by 1920  This theory rapidly became a significant and necessary tool for theorists and experimentalists in the new fields of atomic physics  nuclear physics  and quantum mechanics  Conversely  general relativity did not appear to be as useful  There appeared to be little applicability for experimentalists as most applications were for astronomical scales  It seemed limited to only making minor corrections to predictions of Newtonian gravitation theory   Finally  the mathematics of general relativity appeared to be very difficult  Consequently  it was thought that a small number of people in the world  at that time  could fully understand the theory in detail  but this has been discredited by Richard Feynman  Then  at around 1960 a critical resurgence in interest occurred which has resulted in making general relativity central to physics and astronomy  New mathematical techniques applicable to the study of general relativity substantially streamlined calculations  From this  physically discernible concepts were isolated from the mathematical complexity  Also  the discovery of exotic astronomical phenomena  in which general relativity was relevant  helped to catalyze this resurgence  The astronomical phenomena included quasars  1963   the 3 kelvin microwave background radiation  1965   pulsars  1967   and the discovery of the first black hole candidates  1981    2  On the theory of relativity  Einstein stated that the theory of relativity belongs to a class of  principle theories   As such it employs an analytic method  This means that the elements which comprise this theory are not based on hypothesis but on empirical discovery  The empirical discovery leads to understanding the general characteristics of natural processes  Mathematical models are then developed to describe accurately the observed natural processes  Therefore  by analytical means the necessary conditions that have to be satisfied are deduced  Separate events must satisfy these conditions  Experience should then match the conclusions   The special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity are connected  As stated below  special theory of relativity applies to all physical phenomena except gravity  The general theory provides the law of gravitation  and its relation to other forces of nature   3  Special relativity  Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime  It was introduced in Einstein s 1905 paper  On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies   for the contributions of many other physicists see History of special relativity   Special relativity is based on two postulates which are contradictory in classical mechanics   The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another  principle of relativity    The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers  regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the light source  The resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical mechanics  For instance  postulate 2 explains the results of the Michelson–Morley experiment  Moreover  the theory has many surprising and counterintuitive consequences  Some of these are   Relativity of simultaneity  Two events  simultaneous for one observer  may not be simultaneous for another observer if the observers are in relative motion   Time dilation  Moving clocks are measured to tick more slowly than an observer s  stationary  clock   Relativistic mass  Length contraction  Objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer   Mass–energy equivalence    energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable   Maximum speed is finite  No physical object  message or field line can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum  The defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the Galilean transformations of classical mechanics by the Lorentz transformations   See Maxwell s equations of electromagnetism    4  General relativity  General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915  The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle  under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field  for example when standing on the surface of the Earth  are physically identical  The upshot of this is that free fall is inertial motion  an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them  instead of this being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical mechanics  This is incompatible with classical mechanics and special relativity because in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other  but objects in free fall do so  To resolve this difficulty Einstein first proposed that spacetime is curved  In 1915  he devised the Einstein field equations which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass  energy  and momentum within it   Some of the consequences of general relativity are   Clocks run slower in deeper gravitational wells  This is called gravitational time dilation   Orbits precess in a way unexpected in Newton s theory of gravity   This has been observed in the orbit of Mercury and in binary pulsars    Rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field   Rotating masses  drag along  the spacetime around them  a phenomenon termed  frame dragging    The universe is expanding  and the far parts of it are moving away from us faster than the speed of light  Technically  general relativity is a theory of gravitation whose defining feature is its use of the Einstein field equations  The solutions of the field equations are metric tensors which define the topology of the spacetime and how objects move inertially   5  Experimental evidence  5 1  Tests of special relativity  Like all falsifiable scientific theories  relativity makes predictions that can be tested by experiment  In the case of special relativity  these include the principle of relativity  the constancy of the speed of light  and time dilation  The predictions of special relativity have been confirmed in numerous tests since Einstein published his paper in 1905  but three experiments conducted between 1881 and 1938 were critical to its validation  These are the Michelson–Morley experiment  the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment  and the Ives–Stilwell experiment  Einstein derived the Lorentz transformations from first principles in 1905  but these three experiments allow the transformations to be induced from experimental evidence   Maxwell s equations – the foundation of classical electromagnetism – describe light as a wave which moves with a characteristic velocity  The modern view is that light needs no medium of transmission  but Maxwell and his contemporaries were convinced that light waves were propagated in a medium  analogous to sound propagating in air  and ripples propagating on the surface of a pond  This hypothetical medium was called the luminiferous aether  at rest relative to the  fixed stars  and through which the Earth moves  Fresnel s partial ether dragging hypothesis ruled out the measurement of first order  v c  effects  and although observations of second order effects  v2 c2  were possible in principle  Maxwell thought they were too small to be detected with then current technology   The Michelson–Morley experiment was designed to detect second order effects of the  aether wind  – the motion of the aether relative to the earth  Michelson designed an instrument called the Michelson interferometer to accomplish this  The apparatus was more than accurate enough to detect the expected effects  but he obtained a null result when the first experiment was conducted in 1881  and again in 1887  Although the failure to detect an aether wind was a disappointment  the results were accepted by the scientific community  In an attempt to salvage the aether paradigm  Fitzgerald and Lorentz independently created an ad hoc hypothesis in which the length of material bodies changes according to their motion through the aether  This was the origin of FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction  and their hypothesis had no theoretical basis  The interpretation of the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment is that the round trip travel time for light is isotropic  independent of direction   but the result alone is not enough to discount the theory of the aether or validate the predictions of special relativity   While the Michelson–Morley experiment showed that the velocity of light is isotropic  it said nothing about how the magnitude of the velocity changed  if at all  in different inertial frames  The Kennedy–Thorndike experiment was designed to do that  and was first performed in 1932 by Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike  They obtained a null result  and concluded that  there is no effect     unless the velocity of the solar system in space is no more than about half that of the earth in its orbit   That possibility was thought to be too coincidental to provide an acceptable explanation  so from the null result of their experiment it was concluded that the round trip time for light is the same in all inertial reference frames   The Ives–Stilwell experiment was carried out by Herbert Ives and G R  Stilwell first in 1938 and with better accuracy in 1941  It was designed to test the transverse Doppler effect – the redshift of light from a moving source in a direction perpendicular to its velocity – which had been predicted by Einstein in 1905  The strategy was to compare observed Doppler shifts with what was predicted by classical theory  and look for a Lorentz factor correction  Such a correction was observed  from which was concluded that the frequency of a moving atomic clock is altered according to special relativity   Those classic experiments have been repeated many times with increased precision  Other experiments include  for instance  relativistic energy and momentum increase at high velocities  time dilation of moving particles  and modern searches for Lorentz violations   5 2  Tests of general relativity  General relativity has also been confirmed many times  the classic experiments being the perihelion precession of Mercury s orbit  the deflection of light by the Sun  and the gravitational redshift of light  Other tests confirmed the equivalence principle and frame dragging   6  History  The history of special relativity consists of many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by Albert A  Michelson  Hendrik Lorentz  Henri Poincaré and others  It culminated in the theory of special relativity proposed by Albert Einstein  and subsequent work of Max Planck  Hermann Minkowski and others   General relativity  GR  is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915  with contributions by many others after 1915   Currently  it can be said that far from being simply of theoretical scientific interest or requiring experimental verification  the analysis of relativistic effects on time measurement is an important practical engineering concern in the operation of the global positioning systems such as GPS  GLONASS  and the forthcoming Galileo  as well as in the high precision dissemination of time  Instruments ranging from electron microscopes to particle accelerators simply will not work if relativistic considerations are omitted   7  Everyday applications  The theory of relativity is used in many of our modern electronics such as the Global Positioning System  GPS   GPS systems are made up of three components  the control component  the space component  and the user component  The space component consists of satellites that are placed in specific orbits  The control component consists of a station to which all of the data from the space component is sent  Many relativistic effects occur in GPS systems  Since each of the components is in different reference frames  all of the relativistic effects need to be accounted for so that the GPS works with precision  The clocks used in the GPS systems need to be synchronized  In GPS systems  the gravitational field of the Earth has to be accounted for  There are relativistic effects within the satellite that is in space that need to be accounted for too  GPS systems work with such precision because of the Theory of Relativity   8  Minority views  Einstein s contemporaries did not all accept his new theories at once  However  the theory of relativity is now considered as a cornerstone of modern physics   Although it is widely acknowledged that Einstein was the creator of relativity in its modern understanding  some believe that others deserve credit for it   9  See also
