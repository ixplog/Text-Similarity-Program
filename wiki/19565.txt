education  Mann was born on February 5  1943 in Chicago  Illinois  of Jewish ancestry  the son of grocers Esther and Jack Mann   He received a B A  in English at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he developed interests in history  philosophy and architecture  It was at this time that he first saw Stanley Kubrick s Dr  Strangelove and fell in love with movies  In a recent L A  Weekly interview  he describes the film s impact on him   It said to my whole generation of filmmakers that you could make an individual statement of high integrity and have that film be successfully seen by a mass audience all at the same time  In other words  you didn’t have to be making Seven Brides for Seven Brothers if you wanted to work in the mainstream film industry  or be reduced to niche filmmaking if you wanted to be serious about cinema  So that s what Kubrick meant  aside from the fact that Strangelove was a revelation   His daughter Ami Canaan Mann is also a film director and producer   2  Career  2 1  1960s 1970s  Mann later moved to London in the mid 1960s to go to graduate school in cinema  He went on to receive a graduate degree at the London Film School  He spent seven years in the United Kingdom going to film school and then working on commercials along with contemporaries Alan Parker  Ridley Scott and Adrian Lyne  In 1968  footage he shot of the Paris student revolt for a documentary  Insurrection  aired on NBC s First Tuesday news program and he developed his  68 experiences into the short film Jaunpuri which won the Jury Prize at Cannes in 1970   Mann returned to United States after divorcing his first wife in 1971  He went on to direct a road trip documentary  17 Days Down the Line  Three years later  Hawaii Five O veteran Robert Lewin gave Mann a shot and a crash course on television writing and story structure  Mann wrote four episodes of Starsky and Hutch  three in the first series and one in the second   and the pilot episode for Vega$  Around this time  he worked on a show called Police Story with cop turned novelist Joseph Wambaugh  Police Story concentrated on the detailed realism of a real cop s life and taught Mann that first hand research was essential to bring authenticity to his work  His first feature movie was a television special called The Jericho Mile  which was released theatrically in Europe  It won the Emmy for best MOW in 1979 and the DGA Best Director award   2 2  1980s  His television work also includes being the executive producer on Miami Vice and Crime Story  Contrary to popular belief  he was not the creator of these shows  but the executive producer and showrunner  They were produced by his production company and his cinematic influence is felt throughout each show in terms of casting and style  Mann is now known primarily as a feature film director  He has a distinctive style that is reflected in his works  his trademarks include unusual scores  such as Tangerine Dream in Thief or the new age score to Manhunter  Dante Spinotti is a frequent cinematographer of Mann s pictures   Mann s first cinema feature as director was Thief  1981  starring James Caan  His next film The Keep  1983  was  in retrospect  an uncharacteristic choice  being that it is a supernatural thriller set in Nazi occupied Romania  Though it was a commercial flop  the film has since attained cult status amongst fans   In 1986  Mann was the first to bring Thomas Harris s character of serial killer Hannibal Lecter to the screen with Manhunter  his adaptation of the novel Red Dragon  which starred Brian Cox as a more down to earth Hannibal  The story was remade less than 20 years after it came out by Brett Ratner presumably because Anthony Hopkins reprisal of the role in Ridley Scott s Hannibal had made the character a highly lucrative property  In an interview on the Manhunter DVD  star William Petersen comments that because Mann is so focused on his creations  it takes several years for Mann to complete a film  Petersen believes that this is why Mann does not make films very often   2 3  1990s  He gained widespread recognition in 1992 for his film adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper s book into the epic history film Last of the Mohicans  His biggest critical successes in the 1990s began with the release of Heat in 1995 and The Insider in 1999  The films  which featured Al Pacino along with Robert De Niro in Heat and Russell Crowe in The Insider  showcased Mann s cinematic style and adeptness at creating rich  complex storylines as well as directing actors  The Insider was nominated for seven Academy Awards as a result  including a nomination for Mann s direction   2 4  2000s  With his next film Ali starring Will Smith in 2001  he started experimenting with digital cameras  The film helped catapult Will Smith to greater fame  and he was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance  For his crime film Collateral  which cast Tom Cruise against type by giving him the role of a hitman  Mann shot all of the exterior scenes digitally so that he could achieve more depth and detail during the night scenes while shooting most of the interiors on film stock  In 2004  Mann produced The Aviator  based on the life of Howard Hughes  which he had developed with Leonardo DiCaprio  The Aviator was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture but lost to Million Dollar Baby  After Collateral  Mann directed the film adaptation of Miami Vice which he also executive produced  It stars a completely new cast with Colin Farrell as Don Johnson s character Sonny Crockett  and Jamie Foxx filling Philip Michael Thomas  shoes   Mann served as a producer and Peter Berg as director for The Kingdom and Hancock  Hancock stars Will Smith as a hard drinking superhero who has fallen out of favor with the public and who begins to have a relationship with the wife  Charlize Theron  of a public relations expert  Jason Bateman   who is helping him to repair his image  Mann also makes a cameo appearance in the film as an executive  In the fall of 2007  Mann directed two commercials for Nike  The ad campaign  Leave Nothing  features football action scenes with current NFL players Shawne Merriman and Steven Jackson   In 2009  Mann wrote and directed Public Enemies for Universal Pictures  about the Depression era crime wave  based on Brian Burrough s nonfiction book  Public Enemies  America s Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI  1933–34  It starred Johnny Depp and Christian Bale  Depp played John Dillinger in the film  and Bale played Melvin Purvis  the FBI agent in charge of capturing Dillinger   2 5  2010s  In January 2010 it was reported by Variety that Mann  alongside David Milch  would serve as co executive producer of new TV series Luck  The series was an hour long HBO production  and Mann directed the series  pilot  Although initially renewed for a second season after the airing of the pilot  it was eventually cancelled due to the death of three horses during production  On February 14  2013  it was announced that Mann has been developing an untitled thriller film with screenwriter Morgan Davis Foehl for over a year that he will direct for Legendary Pictures with Chris Hemsworth attached to star In May 2013  Mann started the filming of Blackhat in Los Angeles  Kuala Lumpur  Hong Kong and Jakarta   3  Filming style  Mann s films often contain one to four deadpan male protagonists who are expert in some profession legal or non legal   Importantly  his films often involve a tragic rather than happy ending  or they involve a combination of tragedy and happy ending  such as in Miami Vice  when of the two undercover police officers  one has his girlfriend  also an undercover officer  come out of a coma and the other tearfully separates from his romantic interest  Mann s films contain fast paced  artful scenes that strongly depend on powerful music  where often two opposing sides intermix  such as undercover policework and undercover drug trafficking  so that it is hard to distinguish between the two  For example  in Heat  the criminal and the police detective meet for coffee  as if old business partners  Often it is hard to distinguish between opposing sides  police vs  criminals  etc    where the actions  dress  and mannerisms of the characters are extremely similar  Also  Mann s work often involves landscapes and modes where the heroic protagonists occupy a somewhat secret world  away from ordinary concerns  law  life and death  money  daily life survival duties  family duties  and so on   where the secret world may or may not coincide with ordinary reality  Protagonists often find impassioned romantic interests which are severed under tragic situations near the end of the film  Last of the Mohicans  Heat  Collateral  Miami Vice  Public Enemies   Overall  Mann s films mix artistry  via music  stylishness and emotional intensity  with sexuality  strong violence  humorless noir like stoicism  and complex plot twists   4  Advertising  Mann directed the 2002  Lucky Star  advertisement for Mercedes Benz  which took the form of a film trailer for a purported thriller featuring Benicio del Toro  Mann also directed the 2008 promotional video for Ferrari s California sports car  In 2009 Mann also directed a commercial for Nike that featured several stylistic cues  most notably
