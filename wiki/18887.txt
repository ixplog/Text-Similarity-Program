Metaphilosophy  sometimes called philosophy of philosophy  is ‘the investigation of the nature of philosophy ’ Its subject matter includes the aims of philosophy  the boundaries of philosophy  and its methods  It is considered by some to be a subject apart from philosophy  while others see it as automatically a part of philosophy  and still others see it as a combination of these subjects  The interest in metaphilosophy led to the establishment of the journal Metaphilosophy in January 1970   1  Relationship to philosophy  Some philosophers consider metaphilosophy to be a subject apart from philosophy  above or beyond it  while others object to that idea  Timothy Williamson argues that the philosophy of philosophy is  automatically part of philosophy   as is the philosophy of anything else  Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu write that the separation of first  from second order study has lost popularity as philosophers find it hard to observe the distinction  As evidenced by these contrasting opinions  debate remains as to whether the evaluation of the nature of philosophy is  second order philosophy  or simply  plain philosophy    Many philosophers have expressed doubts over the value of metaphilosophy  Among them is Gilbert Ryle    preoccupation with questions about methods tends to distract us from prosecuting the methods themselves  We run as a rule  worse  not better  if we think a lot about our feet  So let us    not speak of it all but just do it    2  Terminology  The designations metaphilosophy and philosophy of philosophy have a variety of meanings  sometimes taken to be synonyms  and sometimes seen as distinct   Morris Lazerowitz claims to have created the term ‘metaphilosophy’ around 1940 and used it in print in 1942  Lazerowitz proposed that metaphilosophy is ‘the investigation of the nature of philosophy ’ Earlier uses have been found in translations from the French  The term is derived from Greek word meta μετά   after    beyond    with   and philosophía φιλοσοφία   love of wisdom     The term ‘metaphilosophy’ is used by Paul Moser in the sense of a  second order  or more fundamental undertaking than philosophy itself  in the manner suggested by Charles Griswold  This usage was considered nonsense by Ludwig Wittgenstein  who rejected the analogy between metalanguage and a metaphilosophy  As expressed by Martin Heidegger   Some other philosophers treat the prefix meta as simply meaning ‘about   ’  rather than as referring to a metatheoretical  second order  form of philosophy  among them Rescher and Double  Others  such as Williamson  prefer the term ‘philosophy of philosophy’ instead of ‘metaphilosophy’ as it avoids the connotation of a  second order  discipline that looks down on philosophy  and instead denotes something that is a part of it  Joll suggests that to take metaphilosophy as  the application of the methods of philosophy to philosophy itself  is too vague  while the view that sees metaphilosophy as a ‘second order’ or more abstract discipline  outside philosophy   is narrow and tendentious    In the analytical tradition  the term  metaphilosophy  is mostly used to tag commenting and research on previous works as opposed to original contributions towards solving philosophical problems   3  Writings  Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote about the nature of philosophical puzzles and philosophical understanding  He suggested philosophical errors arose from confusions about the nature of philosophical inquiry  In the Philosophical Investigations  Wittgenstein wrote that there is not a metaphilosophy in the sense of a metatheory of philosophy   C  D  Broad distinguished Critical from Speculative philosophy in his  The Subject matter of Philosophy  and its Relations to the special Sciences   in Introduction to Scientific Thought  1923  Curt Ducasse  in Philosophy as a Science  examines several views of the nature of philosophy  and concludes that philosophy has a distinct subject matter  appraisals  Ducasse s view has been among the first to be described as  metaphilosophy    Henri Lefebvre in Metaphilosophie  1965  argued  from a marxian standpoint  in favor of an  ontological break   as a necessary methodological approach for critical social theory  whilst criticizing Louis Althusser s  epistemological break  with subjective marxism  which represented a fundamental theoretical tool for the school of marxist structuralism    Paul Moser writes that typical metaphilosophical discussion includes determining the conditions under which a claim can be said to be a philosophical one  He regards meta ethics  the study of ethics  to be a form of metaphilosophy  as well as meta epistemology  the study of epistemology   4  Topics  Many sub disciplines of philosophy have their own branch of  metaphilosophy   examples being Meta aesthetics  Meta epistemology  Meta ethics  Meta ontology  and so forth  However  some topics within  metaphilosophy  cut across the various subdivisions of philosophy to consider fundamentals important to all its sub disciplines  Some of these are mentioned below   4 1  Aims  Some philosophers  e g  existentialists  pragmatists  think philosophy is ultimately a practical discipline that should help us lead meaningful lives by showing us who we are  how we relate to the world around us and what we should do  Others  e g  analytic philosophers  see philosophy as a technical  formal  and entirely theoretical discipline  with goals such as  the disinterested pursuit of knowledge for its own sake   Other proposed goals of philosophy include  discover ing  the absolutely fundamental reason of everything it investigates    making explicit the nature and significance of ordinary and scientific beliefs   and unifying and transcending the insights given by science and religion  Others proposed that philosophy is a complex discipline because it has 4 or 6 different dimensions   4 2  Boundaries  Defining philosophy and its boundaries is itself problematic  Nigel Warburton has called it  notoriously difficult   There is no straightforward definition  and most interesting definitions are controversial  As Bertrand Russell wrote   While there is some agreement that philosophy involves general or fundamental topics  there is no clear agreement about a series of demarcation issues  including   that between first order and second order investigations  Some authors say that philosophical inquiry is second order  having concepts  theories and presupposition as its subject matter  that it is  thinking about thinking   of a  generally second order character   that philosophers study  rather than use  the concepts that structure our thinking  However  the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy warns that  the borderline between such  second order  reflection  and ways of practicing the first order discipline itself  is not always clear  philosophical problems may be tamed by the advance of a discipline  and the conduct of a discipline may be swayed by philosophical reflection    that between philosophy and empirical science  Some argue that philosophy is distinct from science in that its questions cannot be answered empirically  that is  by observation or experiment  Some analytical philosophers argue that all meaningful empirical questions are to be answered by science  not philosophy  However  some schools of contemporary philosophy such as the pragmatists and naturalistic epistemologists argue that philosophy should be linked to science and should be scientific in the broad sense of that term   preferring to see philosophical reflection as continuous with the best practice of any field of intellectual enquiry    that between philosophy and religion  Some argue that philosophy is distinct from religion in that it allows no place for faith or revelation   that philosophy does not try to answer questions by appeal to revelation  myth or religious knowledge of any kind  but uses reason   without reference to sensible observation and experiments   However  philosophers and theologians such as Thomas Aquinas and Peter Damian have argued that philosophy is the  handmaiden of theology   ancilla theologiae    4 3  Methods  Philosophical method  or philosophical methodology  is the study of how to do philosophy  A common view among philosophers is that philosophy is distinguished by the ways that philosophers follow in addressing philosophical questions  There is not just one method that philosophers use to answer philosophical questions   Recently  some philosophers have cast doubt about intuition as a basic tool in philosophical inquiry  from Socrates up to contemporary philosophy of language  In Rethinking Intuition various thinkers discard intuition as a valid source of knowledge and thereby call into question  a priori  philosophy  Experimental philosophy is a form of philosophical inquiry that makes at least partial use of empirical research—especially opinion polling—in order to address persistent philosophical questions  This is in contrast with the methods found in analytic philosophy  whereby some say a philosopher will sometimes begin by appealing to his or her intuitions on an issue and then form an argument with those intuitions as premises  However  disagreement about what experimental philosophy can accomplish is widespread and several philosophers have offered criticisms  One claim is that the empirical data gathered by experimental philosophers can have an indirect effect on philosophical questions by allowing for a better understanding of the underlying psychological processes which lead to philosophical intuitions   4 4  Progress  A prominent question in metaphilosophy is that of whether or not philosophical progress occurs  and more so  whether such progress in philosophy is even possible  It has even been disputed  most notably by Ludwig Wittgenstein  whether genuine philosophical problems actually exist  The opposite has also been claimed  for example by Karl Popper  who held that such problems do exist  that they are solvable  and that he had actually found definite solutions to some of them   5  See also  Metatheory  Meta knowledge  Meta epistemology  Meta ontology  Metaphysics  Non philosophy  Philosophical progress  Unsolved problems in philosophy  Epistemology  6  References
