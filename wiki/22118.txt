Norn  an extinct North Germanic language  was spoken in the Northern Isles  Orkney and Shetland  off the north coast of mainland Scotland and in Caithness in the far north of the Scottish mainland  After Orkney and Shetland were pledged to Scotland by Norway in 1468 69  it was gradually replaced by Scots   1  History  Norse settlement in the islands probably began in the early 9th century  These settlers are believed to have arrived in very substantial numbers and like those who migrated to Iceland and the Faroe Islands it is probable that most came from the west coast of Norway  Shetland toponymy bears some resemblance to that of northwest Norway  while Norn vocabulary implies links with more southerly Norwegian regions   Orkney and Shetland were pledged to James III in 1468 and 1469 respectively  and it is with these pledges that the replacement of Norn with Scots is most associated  However  the decline of Norse speech in Orkney probably began in 1379 when the earldom passed into the hands of the Sinclairs  and Scots had superseded Norse as the language of prestige on the island by the early 15th century  In Shetland the transition began later  but by the end of the 15th century both islands were bilingual  Despite this  the process by which Scots overtook Norn as the primary spoken language on the islands was not a swift one  and most natives of Orkney and Shetland likely spoke Norn as a first language until the late 16th and early to mid 17th centuries respectively   1 1  Death  It is not known exactly when Norn became extinct  Sources from the 17th and 18th centuries speak of Norn  sometimes identified as  Norse    Norwegian  or  Danish   as being in a state of decline and generally indicate that the language remained stronger in Shetland than in Orkney  A source from 1670 states that there are  only three or four parishes  in Orkney where people speak  Noords or rude Danish  and that they do so  chiefly when they are at their own houses   Another from 1701 indicates that there were still a few monoglot  Norse  speakers who were capable of speaking  no other thing   and notes that there were more speakers of the language in Shetland than in Orkney  It was said in 1703 that the people of Shetland generally spoke English  but that  many among them retain the ancient Danish Language   while in 1750 Orkney born James Mackenzie wrote that Norn was not yet entirely extinct  being  retained by old people   who still spoke it among each other   The last reports of Norn speakers are claimed to be from the 19th century  but it is more likely that the language was dying out in the late 18th century  The isolated islands of Foula and Unst are variously claimed as the last refuges of the language in Shetland  where there were people  who could repeat sentences in Norn  probably passages from folk songs or poems  as late as 1893  Walter Sutherland from Skaw in Unst  who died about 1850  has been cited as the last native speaker of the Norn language  However  fragments of vocabulary survived the death of the main language and remain to this day  mainly in place names and terms referring to plants  animals  weather  mood  and fishing vocabulary   Norn had also been a spoken language in Caithness but had probably become extinct there by the 15th century  replaced by Scots  Hence  some scholars also speak about  Caithness Norn   but others avoid this  Even less is known about  Caithness Norn  than about Orkney and Shetland Norn  Almost no written Norn has survived  but what little remains includes a version of the Lord s Prayer and a ballad  Michael P Barnes  professor of Scandinavian Studies at University College London  has published a study  The Norn Language of Orkney and Shetland   2  Classification  Norn is an Indo European language belonging to the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages  Together with Faroese  Icelandic and Norwegian  it belongs to the West Scandinavian group  separating it from the East Scandinavian group consisting of Swedish  Danish and Gutnish  While this classification is based on the differences between the North Germanic languages at the time they split  their present day characteristics justify another classification  dividing them into Insular Scandinavian and Mainland Scandinavian language groups  based on mutual intelligibility  Under this system  Norwegian is grouped together with Danish and Swedish  because the last millennium has seen all three undergo important changes  especially in grammar and lexis  which have set them apart from Faroese and Icelandic  Norn is generally considered to have been fairly similar to Faroese  sharing many phonological and grammatical traits  and might even have been mutually intelligible with it  thus  it can be considered an Insular Scandinavian language   Few written texts remain  It is distinct from the present day dialect of Shetland  termed by linguists Shetlandic   3  Sounds  The phonology of Norn can never be determined with much precision due to the lack of source material  but the general aspects can be extrapolated from the few written sources that do exist  Norn shared many traits with the dialects of south west Norway  This includes a voicing of to before or between vowels and  in the Shetland dialect  but only partially in the Orkney dialect  a conversion of and   thing  and  that  respectively  to and respectively   4  Grammar  The features of Norn grammar were very similar to the other Scandinavian languages  There were two numbers  three genders and four cases  nominative  accusative  genitive and dative   The two main conjugations of verbs in present and past tense were also present and like all other North Germanic languages  it used a suffix instead of a prepositioned article to indicate definiteness as in modern Scandinavian  man n    man    mannen   the man    Though it is difficult to be certain of many of the aspects of Norn grammar  documents indicate that it may have featured subjectless clauses  which were common in the West Scandinavian languages   5  Sample text  The following are Norn and Old Norse versions of the Lord s Prayer   Orkney Norn   Shetland Norn   Old West Norse   Faroese  Icelandic  Norwegian  nynorsk 1978 85   Norwegian  nynorsk 2011  A Shetland  guddick   riddle  in Norn  which Jakob Jakobsen heard told on Unst  the northernmost island in Shetland  in the 1890s  The same riddle is also known from the Faroe Islands  from Iceland  and a variation also occurs in England   The answer is a cow  four teats hang  four legs walk  two horns and two ears stand skyward  two eyes show the way to the field and one tail comes shaking  dangling  behind   6  Modern use  Most of the use of Norn Norse in modern day Shetland and Orkney is purely ceremonial  and mostly in Old Norse  for example the Shetland motto  which is Með lögum skal land byggja   with law shall land be built   which is the same motto used by the Icelandic police force and inspired by the Danish Codex Holmiensis   Another example of the use of Norse Norn in the Northern Isles can be found in the names of ferries   NorthLink Ferries has ships named MV Hamnavoe  after the old name for Stromness   and MV Hjaltland  Shetland  and MV Hrossey   Horse Island   an old name for Mainland  Orkney    The Yell Sound Ferry sails from Ulsta on the island to Toft on the Shetland Mainland  The service is operated by two ferries—Daggri  Norse for  dawn    launched in 2003 and Dagalien  Norse for  dusk   launched in 2004  Norn words are still used to describe many of the colour and pattern variations in the native sheep of Shetland and Orkney  which survive as the Shetland and North Ronaldsay breeds  Icelandic uses similar words for many of the same colour variations in Icelandic sheep   There are some enthusiasts who are engaged in developing and disseminating a modern form called Nynorn   New Norn    based upon linguistic analysis of the known records and Norse linguistics in general   7  Notes  8  See also  Udal law  the Norse law system of the Northern Isles   9  Further reading  Barnes  Michael P   Orkney and Shetland Norn   In
