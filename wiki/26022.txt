Rehoboam  pronounced         was  according to the Hebrew Bible  initially king of the United Monarchy of Israel but after the ten northern tribes of Israel rebelled in 932 931 BC to form the independent Kingdom of Israel he was king of the Kingdom of Judah  or southern kingdom  He was a son of Solomon and a grandson of David  His mother was Naamah the Ammonite  As a result of an Egyptian incursion to control the Philistia coast  the Kingdom of Judah became tributary to Egypt   1  Background  Solomon s wisdom and power were not sufficient to prevent the rebellion of several of his border cities  Damascus under Rezon secured its independence of Solomon  and Jeroboam  a superintendent of works  his ambition stirred by the words of the prophet Ahijah  I Kings xi  29 40   fled to Egypt  Thus before the death of Solomon the apparently unified kingdom of David began to disintegrate  With Damascus independent and a powerful man of Ephraim  the most prominent of the Ten Tribes  awaiting his opportunity  the future of Solomon s kingdom became dubious   2  Biblical narrative  Conventional Bible chronology dates the start of Rehoboam s reign to the mid 10th century BC  His reign is described in and and in In the Hebrew Bible  Rehoboam was 41 years old when he ascended the throne   The assembly for the coronation of Solomon s successor  Rehoboam  was called at Shechem  the one sacredly historic city within the territory of the Ten Tribes  Before the coronation took place the assembly requested certain reforms in the policy followed by Rehoboam s father  Solomon  The reforms requested would materially reduce the royal exchequer and hence its power to continue the magnificence of Solomon s court  The older men counseled Rehoboam at least to speak to the people in a civil manner  it is not clear whether they counseled him to accept the demands   However  the new king sought the advice from the people he had grown up with  who advised the king to show no weakness to the people  and to tax them even more  which Rehoboam did  He proclaimed to the people   Although the ostensible reason was the heavy burden laid upon Israel because of Solomon s great outlay for buildings and for luxury of all kinds  the other reasons include the historical opposition between the north and the south  The two sections had acted independently until David  by his victories  succeeded in uniting all the tribes  though the Ephraimitic jealousy was ever ready to develop into open revolt  Religious considerations were also operative  The building of the Temple was a severe blow for the various sanctuaries scattered through the land  and the priests of the high places probably supported the revolt  Josephus  Ant   VIII   viii  3  makes the rebels exclaim    We leave to Rehoboam the Temple his father built    Jeroboam and the people rebelled  with the ten northern tribes breaking away and forming a separate kingdom  The new breakaway kingdom continued to be called Kingdom of Israel  and was also known as Samaria  or Ephraim or the northern Kingdom  The realm Rehoboam was left with was called Kingdom of Judah   2 1  Civil war  Rehoboam went to war against the new Kingdom of Israel with a force of 180 000 soldiers  However  he was advised against fighting his brethren  and so returned to Jerusalem  The text reports that Israel and Judah were in a state of war throughout his 17 year reign   2 2  Egyptian invasion  In the 5th year of Rehoboam s reign Shishaq  king of Egypt  brought a huge army and took many cities  According to Joshua  son of Nadav  the mention in 2 Chron  11  6 sqq   that Rehoboam built fifteen fortified cities  indicates that the attack was not unexpected  The account in Chronicles states that Shishaq marched with 1 200 chariots  60 000 horsemen and troops who came with him from Egypt  Libyans  Sukkites  and Kushites  Shishaq s armies captured all of the fortified towns leading to Jerusalem between Gezer and Gibeon  When they laid siege to Jerusalem  Rehoboam gave Shishaq all of the treasures out of the temple as a tribute  The Egyptian campaign cut off trade with south Arabia via Elath and the Negev that had been established during Solomon s reign  Judah became a vassal state of Egypt   An account of this invasion from the Egyptian perspective can be found in the Shishaq Relief at the Bubastis Portal near the Temple of Amun at Karnak   2 3  Succession  Rehoboam had 18 wives and 60 concubines  They bore him 28 sons and 60 daughters  His wives included Mahalath  the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David  and Abihail  the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse  His sons with Abihail were Jeush  Shemariah  and Zaham  After Abihail he married Maacah  daughter of Absalom  David s son  His sons with Maacah were Abijah  Attai  Ziza  and Shelomith  The names of his other wives  sons and all his daughters are not given   Rehoboam reigned for 17 years  When he died he was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem  He was succeeded by his son Abijah   3  Chronology  Using the information in Kings and Chronicles Edwin Thiele has calculated the date for the division of the kingdom is 931 930 BC  Thiele noticed that for the first seven kings of Israel  ignoring Zimri s inconsequential seven day reign   the synchronisms to Judean kings fell progressively behind by one year for each king  Thiele saw this as evidence that the northern kingdom was measuring the years by a non accession system  first partial year of reign was counted as year one   whereas the southern kingdom was using the accession method  it was counted as year zero   Once this was understood  the various reign lengths and cross synchronisms for these kings was worked out  and the sum of reigns for both kingdoms produced 931 930 BC for the division of the kingdom when working backwards from the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC   4  References
