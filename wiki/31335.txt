Territorial integrity is the principle under international law that nation states should not attempt to promote secessionist movements or to promote border changes in other nation states  Conversely it states that imposition by force of a border change is an act of aggression   In recent years there has been tension between this principle and the concept of humanitarian intervention under Article 73 b of the United Nations Charter  to develop self government  to take due account of the political aspirations of the peoples  and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions  according to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and their varying stages of advancement    1  History of territorial integrity  As far back as the earliest written records  there have been political units claiming a definite territory  Intrusion into this territory was an act of war  and normally settled by battle  There were also sometimes several layers of authority  with units waging war on each other while both recognising some higher authority  Ancient and mediaeval nobility would fight private wars amongst while still acknowledging the same king or emperor  such as was case in the Spring and Autumn Period in ancient China  when the Eastern Zhou Dynasty were nominal rulers  Catholic monarchs would often fight one another while recognizing the ecclesiastical authority of the same Pope   Supporters of concept of Westphalian sovereignty consider that the modern idea of territorial integrity began with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648  This is disputed   The League of Nations was intended to uphold territorial integrity and other principles of international law  It did condemn the Italian invasion of Ethiopia  It broadly supported the Chinese Republic over the creation of Manchukuo in Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia  Most historians say that the League was discredited by its failure to make these judgements effective   With the formation of the United Nations  UN  and  later  such organizations as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  now Organization for Security and Co operation in Europe   territorial integrity became a part of international resolutions  The Helsinki Final Act dealt with both the inviolability of frontiers and the territorial integrity of States  among other things   2  Territorial integrity in a changing world  The recent  post World War II  strict application of territorial integrity has given rise to a number of problems and  when faced with reality  on the ground   can be seen as too artificial a construct   Prince Hans Adam II of Liechtenstein  speaking to the International Institute for Strategic Studies on 25 January 2001  argued for a more flexible approach to territorial integrity  in line with historical norms  saying   Let us accept the fact that states have lifecycles similar to those of human beings who created them  Hardly any Member State of the United Nations has existed within its present borders for longer than five generations  The attempt to freeze human evolution has in the past been a futile undertaking and has probably brought about more violence than if such a process had been controlled peacefully  Restrictions on self determination threaten not only democracy itself but the state which seeks its legitimation in democracy    At the 2005 World Summit  the world s nations agreed on a  Responsibility to Protect  giving a right of humanitarian intervention  It has been argued that this could create a flexible application of concept of sovereignty and territorial integrity  easing the strict adherence and taking into account the de facto status of the territory and other factors present on a case by case basis  The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674  adopted by the United Nations Security Council on April 28  2006   Reaffirm ed  the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity    However  this responsibility to protect refers only to the ability of external powers to override sovereignty and does not explicitly involve the changing of borders   3  See also  Breakaway states  Crime of aggression  Secession  Self determination  2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine  Uti possidetis  4  References  5  Further reading  Sebastian Anstis and Mark Zacher  June 2010    The Normative Bases of the Global Territorial Order   Diplomacy and Statecraft 21  306 323   Mark Zacher  2001    The Territorial Integrity Norm   International Organization 55  215 250
