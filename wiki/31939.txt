In early Germanic paganism  *Wulþuz   glory   Old Norse Ullr  appears to have been a major god  or an epithet of an important god  in prehistoric times   The term wolþu   glory   possibly in reference to the god  is attested on the 3rd century Thorsberg chape  as owlþu    and there are many placenames in Ullr and a related name  Ullinn  but medieval Icelandic sources have only sparse material on the god Ullr  The medieval Norse word was Latinized as Ollerus  The Modern Icelandic form is Ullur  In the mainland Scandinavian languages the modern form is Ull   The Old English cognate wuldor means  glory  but is not used as a proper name  although it figures frequently in kennings for the Christian God such as wuldres cyning  king of glory   wuldorfæder  glory father  or wuldor alwealda  glorious all ruler    1  Archaeological record  1 1  Thorsberg chape  The Thorsberg chape  a metal piece belonging to a scabbard found in the Thorsberg moor  bears an Elder Futhark inscription  one of the earliest known altogether  dating to roughly AD 200   owlþuþewaz   niwajmariz The first element owlþu  for wolþu   means  glory    glorious one   Old Norse Ullr  Old English wuldor  The second element   þewaz  means  slave  servant   The whole compound is a personal name or title   servant of the glorious one    servant priest of Ullr   Niwajmariz means  well honored    1 2  Lilla Ullevi  In Lilla Ullevi   little shrine of Ullr   north of Stockholm archaeologists excavated during 2007 the site of a religious worshiping ground for Ullr  from 500 to 800 AD   The well preserved state of the shrine may be unique in Scandinavia  it was shaped like a platform with two  arms  of rocks having four erected poles in front of it where there was probably a wooden platform  Moreover  the archaeologists found 65  amulet rings  in the area  rings are reported to have been used when people swore oaths  They may be the rings of Ullr that are referred to in the eddic poem Atlakviða   2  Gesta Danorum  In Saxo Grammaticus  12th century work Gesta Danorum  where gods appear euhemerized  Ollerus is described as a cunning wizard with magical means of transportation   When Odin was exiled  Ollerus was chosen to take his place  Ollerus ruled under the name Odin for ten years until the true Odin was called back  whereupon Ollerus retired to Sweden where he was slain by Danes   3  Poetic Edda  Ullr is mentioned in the poem Grímnismál where the homes of individual gods are recounted  The English versions shown here are by Thorpe   The name Ýdalir  meaning  yew dales   is not otherwise attested  The yew was an important material in the making of bows  and the word ýr   yew   is often used metonymically to refer to bows  It seems likely that the name Ýdalir is connected with the idea of Ullr as a bow god   Another strophe in Grímnismál also mentions Ullr   The strophe is obscure but may refer to some sort of religious ceremony  It seems to indicate Ullr as an important god   The last reference to Ullr in the Poetic Edda is found in Atlakviða   Both Atlakviða and Grímnismál are often considered to be among the oldest extant Eddic poems  It may not be a coincidence that they are the only ones to refer to Ullr  Again we seem to find Ullr associated with some sort of ceremony  this time that of swearing an oath by a ring  a practice associated with Thor in later sources  During an excavation in 2007  of a Vendel era shrine for Ullr north of Stockholm  many symbolic rings were discovered  which are considered to represent Ullr s ring  see the archaeology section above    4  Prose Edda  In chapter 31 of Gylfaginning in the Prose Edda  written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson  Ullr is referred to as a son of Sif  with a father unrecorded in surviving sources  and as a stepson of Sif s husband  the major Germanic god Thor   In Skáldskaparmál  the second part of the Prose Edda  Snorri mentions Ullr again in a discussion of kennings  Snorri informs his readers that Ullr can be called ski god  bow god  hunting god and shield god  In turn a shield can be called Ullr s ship  Despite these tantalising tidbits Snorri relates no myths about Ullr  It seems likely that he didn t know any  the god having faded from memory   5  Skaldic poetry  Snorri s note that a shield can be called Ullr s ship is borne out by surviving skaldic poetry with kennings such as askr Ullar  far Ullar and kjóll Ullar all meaning Ullr s ship and referring to shields  While the origin of this kenning is unknown it could be connected with the identity of Ullr as a ski god  Early skis  or perhaps sleds  might have been reminiscent of shields  A late Icelandic composition  Laufás Edda  offers the prosaic explanation that Ullr s ship was called Skjöldr   Shield    The name of Ullr is also common in warrior kennings  where it is used as other god names are   Three skaldic poems  Þórsdrápa  Haustlöng and a fragment by Eysteinn Valdason  refer to Thor as Ullr s stepfather  confirming Snorri s information   6  Etymology  The name Ullr is probably descended from the same word as Old English wuldor and the Gothic wulþus  meaning  glory   The reconstructed Proto Germanic form is *Wulþuz   7  Toponymy  Ullr s name appears in several important Norwegian and Swedish place names  but not in Denmark or in Iceland   This indicates that Ullr had at some point a religious importance in Scandinavia that is greater than what is immediately apparent from the scant surviving textual references  It is also probably significant that the placenames referring to this god are often found close to placenames referring to another deity  Njörðr in Sweden and Freyr in Norway  Some of the Norwegian placenames have a variant form  Ullinn  It has been suggested that this is the remnant of a pair of twin gods and further that there may have been a female Ullin  on the model of divine pairs such as Fjörgynn and Fjörgyn   7 1  Norway  Ullarhváll   Ullr s hill     name of an old

and a cousin of Skaði  His father  Egill  was the greatest archer in the mythology  and Ullr follows in his father s footsteps  Ullr helped Svipdagr Eiríkr rescue Freyja from the giants  He also ruled over the Vanir when they held Ásgarðr during the war between the Vanir and the Æsir   While most of Rydberg s theories are dismissed as fanciful by modern scholars his idea that Ullr is connected with the elves of Völundarkviða is not absurd  Both seem associated with skiing and hunting and since Ullr s father is not identified as one of the Æsir he may have been of another race   9  Modern culture  Within the winter skiing community of Europe the Old Norse god  Ullr  is considered the Guardian Patron Saint of Skiers  German Schutzpatron der Skifahrer   An Ullr medallion or Ullr ski medal  depicting the Scandinavian god Ullr on skis holding a bow and arrow  is widely worn as a talisman by both recreational and professional skiers as well as ski patrols in Europe and elsewhere   Ullr is featured as a playable god in the popular video game Smite by American development studio Hi Rez Studios   The town of Breckenridge  Colorado hosts a week long festival called  Ullr Fest  each year in January  featuring numerous events designed to win his favor in an effort to bring snow to the historic ski town  Breck Ullr Fest was first held in 1962   Ullr is one of the incarnated gods in the New Zealand comedy drama The Almighty Johnsons  The part of  Mike Johnson Ullr  is played by Tim Balme   10  See also  Skaði  Coat of arms of Ullensaker    annual celebration in Breckenridge  Colorado Ullr is the only deity in the human pantheon who was traditionally represented on skis  Ullr has gained reverence among ski mountaineers in North America and is honoured in good humour for bountiful snowfall   11  Notes  12  References  Eysteinn Björnsson  ed    2005      Eysteinn Björnsson  2001    Eysteinn Björnsson   Finnur Jónsson  1931   Lexicon Poeticum   Ullr   S  L  Møllers Bogtrykkeri
