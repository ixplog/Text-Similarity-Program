In Norse mythology  Víðarr  Old Norse  possibly  wide ruler   sometimes anglicized as Vidar  Vithar  Vidarr  and Vitharr  is a god among the Æsir associated with vengeance  Víðarr is described as the son of Odin and the jötunn Gríðr  and is foretold to avenge his father s death by killing the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarök  a conflict which he is described as surviving  Víðarr is attested in the Poetic Edda  compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources  the Prose Edda  written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson  and is interpreted as depicted with Fenrir on the Gosforth Cross  A number of theories surround the figure  including theories around potential ritual silence and a Proto Indo European basis   1  Attestations  1 1  Poetic Edda  In the Poetic Edda  Víðarr is mentioned in the poems Völuspá  Vafthrúdnismál  Grímnismál  and Lokasenna  In stanzas 54 and 55 of the poem Völuspá  a völva tells Odin that his son Víðarr will avenge Odin s death at Ragnarök by stabbing Fenrir in the heart  In stanzas 51 and 53 of Vafthrúdnismál  Vafþrúðnir states that Víðarr and his brother Váli will both live in the  temples of the gods  after Surtr s fire has ceded and that Víðarr will avenge the death of his father Odin by sundering the cold jaws of Fenrir in battle   In stanza 17 of Grímnismál  during Odin s visions of various dwelling places of the gods  he describes Víðarr s  here anglicized as  Vidar   residence   According to Lokasenna  Loki rebukes the gods at the start of the poem for not properly welcoming him to the feast at Ægir s hall  In stanza 10  Odin finally relents to the rules of hospitality  urging Víðarr to stand and pour a drink for the quarrelsome guest  Víðarr does so  and then Loki toasts the Æsir before beginning his flyting   1 2  Prose Edda  Víðarr is referenced in the Prose Edda books Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál   1 2 1  Gylfaginning  Víðarr is referenced in the book Gylfaginning in chapters 29  51  and 53  In chapter 29  Víðarr is introduced by the enthroned figure of High as  the silent god  with a thick shoe  that he is nearly as strong as the god Thor  and that the gods rely on him in times of immense difficulties   In chapter 51  High foretells that  during Ragnarök  the wolf Fenrir will devour Odin  Víðarr will avenge him by stepping down with one foot on the lower jaw of the monster  grabbing his upper jaw in one hand and tearing his mouth apart  killing him  Víðarr s  thick shoe  is described as consisting of all the extra leather pieces that people have cut from their own shoes at the toe and heel  collected by the god throughout all time  Therefore  anyone who is concerned enough to give assistance to the gods should throw these pieces away   In chapter 54  following Ragnarök and the rebirth of the world  Víðarr along with his brother Váli will have survived both the swelling of the sea and the fiery conflagration unleashed by Surtr  completely unharmed  and shall thereafter dwell on the field Iðavöllr   where the city of Asgard had previously been    1 2 2  Skáldskaparmál  According to Skáldskaparmál  Víðarr was one of the twelve presiding male gods seated in their thrones at a banquet for the visiting Ægir  At a point in dialogue between the skaldic god Bragi and Ægir  Snorri himself begins speaking of the myths in euhemeristic terms and states that the historical equivalent of Víðarr was the Trojan hero Aeneas who survived the Trojan War and went on to achieve  great deeds    Later in the book  various kennings are given for Víðarr  including again the  silent As    possessor of the iron shoe    enemy and slayer of Fenrisulf    the gods  avenging As    father s homestead inhabiting As    son of Odin   and  brother of the Æsir   In the tale of the god Thor s visit to the hall of the jötunn Geirröd  Gríðr is stated as the mother of  Víðarr the Silent  who assists Thor in his journey  In chapter 33  after returning from Asgard and feasting with the gods  Ægir invites the gods to come to his hall in three months  Fourteen gods make the trip to attend the feast  including Víðarr  In chapter 75  Víðarr s name appears twice in a list of Æsir   2  Archaeological record  The mid 11th century Gosforth Cross  located in Cumbria  England  has been described as depicting a combination of scenes from the Christian Judgement Day and the pagan Ragnarök  The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style  including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head  one of whose feet is thrust into the beast s forked tongue and on its lower jaw  while a hand is placed against its upper jaw  a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir  The depiction has also been theorized as a metaphor for Jesus s defeat of Satan   3  Theories  Theories have been proposed that Víðarr s silence may derive from a ritual silence or other abstentions which often accompany acts of vengeance  as for example in Völuspá and Baldrs draumar when Váli  conceived for the sole purpose of avenging Baldr s death  abstains from washing his hands and combing his hair  until he brought Baldr s adversary to the funeral pyre   Parallels have been drawn between chapter 31 of Tacitus  1st century CE work Germania where Tacitus describes that members of the Chatti  a Germanic tribe  may not shave or groom before having first slain an enemy   Georges Dumézil theorized that Víðarr represents a cosmic figure from an archetype derived from the Proto Indo Europeans  Dumézil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space  due to his placement of his foot on the wolf s lower jaw and his hand on the wolf s upper jaw  and horizontal space  due to his wide step and strong shoe  and that  by killing the wolf  Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the cosmos  and the cosmos can thereafter be restored after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök  Thus Dumézil conceives of Víðarr as a spatial god  per the hypothesized Víð  wide root   O E  wid  from P Gmc  *widas  cf  O S   O Fris  wid  O N  viðr  Du  wijd  O H G  wit  Ger  weit   Dumézil substantiates this claim with the text of the Lokasenna  in which Víðarr  trying to mediate the dispute with Loki  urges the other Aesir to  grant Loki his space  at the feasting table  Dumézil argues that this play on Víðarr s spatiality would have been understood by an audience familiar with the God  an interpretation further warranted by his reading of the Lokasenna as being in significant part a book of puns and word plays about the different Aesir  Dumézil also suggests that Víðarr s spatiality is seen in the Vishnu of the Vedic traditions  both etymologically  the Vi  root  and mythologically  citing the story of Bali and Vishnu  In this legend  Vishnu  in the form of Vamana  tricks the malevolent king Bali  who has secured dominion over the whole Earth  by making Bali promise to grant Vamana all the land he can cover in three paces  Vamana turns himself into a giant and strides across all of heaven and Earth  taking Bali s head and granting him immortality in lieu of taking the last pace  Dumézil theorizes that these myths of Fenrir Víðarr and Bali Vishnu may have a common origin in an Indo European God of spatiality  similar but distinct from the hypothetical framing or entry exit God that spawned Janus and Heimdall   4  Notes  5  References  Byock  Jesse  Trans
