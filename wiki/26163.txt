The Real time Transport Protocol  RTP  sometimes referred to as RTTP  defines a standardized packet format for delivering audio and video over IP networks  RTP is used extensively in communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media  such as telephony  video teleconference applications  television services and web based push to talk features   RTP is used in conjunction with the RTP Control Protocol  RTCP   While RTP carries the media streams  e g   audio and video   RTCP is used to monitor transmission statistics and quality of service  QoS  and aids synchronization of multiple streams  RTP is one of the technical foundations of Voice over IP and in this context is often used in conjunction with a signaling protocol such as the Session Initiation Protocol  SIP  which assists in setting up connections across the network   RTP was developed by the Audio Video Transport Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF  and first published in 1996 as RFC 1889  superseded by RFC 3550 in 2003   1  Overview  RTP is designed for end to end  real time  transfer of stream data  The protocol provides facilities for jitter compensation and detection of out of sequence arrival in data  which are common during transmissions on an IP network  RTP allows data transfer to multiple destinations through IP multicast  RTP is regarded as the primary standard for audio video transport in IP networks and is used with an associated profile and payload format   Real time multimedia streaming applications require timely delivery of information and can tolerate some packet loss to achieve this goal  For example  loss of a packet in audio application may result in loss of a fraction of a second of audio data  which can be made unnoticeable with suitable error concealment algorithms  The Transmission Control Protocol  TCP   although standardized for RTP use  is not normally used in RTP applications because TCP favors reliability over timeliness  Instead the majority of the RTP implementations are built on the User Datagram Protocol  UDP   Other transport protocols specifically designed for multimedia sessions are SCTP and DCCP  although    they are not in widespread use   RTP was developed by the Audio Video Transport working group of the IETF standards organization  RTP is used in conjunction with other protocols such as H 323 and RTSP  The RTP standard defines a pair of protocols  RTP and RTCP  RTP is used for transfer of multimedia data  and the RTCP is used to periodically send control information and QoS parameters   1 1  Protocol components  The RTP specification describes two sub protocols   The data transfer protocol  RTP  which deals with the transfer of real time data  Information provided by this protocol include timestamps  for synchronization   sequence numbers  for packet loss and reordering detection  and the payload format which indicates the encoded format of the data   The control protocol RTCP is used to specify quality of service  QoS  feedback and synchronization between the media streams  The bandwidth of RTCP traffic compared to RTP is small  typically around 5%   An optional signaling protocol such as H 323  Session Initiation Protocol  SIP   or Jingle  XMPP   An optional media description protocol such as Session Description Protocol  1 2  Sessions  An RTP Session is established for each multimedia stream  A session consists of an IP address with a pair of ports for RTP and RTCP  For example  audio and video streams will have separate RTP sessions  enabling a receiver to deselect a particular stream  The ports which form a session are negotiated using other protocols such as RTSP  using SDP in the setup method  and SIP  According to the specification  an RTP port should be even and the RTCP port is the next higher odd port number  RTP and RTCP typically use unprivileged UDP ports  1024 to 65535   but may use other transport protocols  most notably  SCTP and DCCP  as well  as the protocol design is transport independent   2  Profiles and Payload formats  One of the design considerations of RTP was to carry a range of multimedia formats  such as H 264  MPEG 4  MJPEG  MPEG  etc   and allow new formats to be added without revising the RTP standard  The design of RTP is based on the architectural principle known as application level framing  ALF   The information required by a specific application s needs is not included in the generic RTP header  but is instead provided through RTP profiles and payload formats  For each class of application  e g   audio  video   RTP defines a profile and one or more associated payload formats  A complete specification of RTP for a particular application usage will require a profile and payload format specification s    The profile defines the codecs used to encode the payload data and their mapping to payload format codes in the Payload Type  PT  field of the RTP header  see below   Each profile is accompanied by several payload format specifications  each of which describes the transport of a particular encoded data  The audio payload formats include G 711  G 723  G 726  G 729  GSM  QCELP  MP3  and DTMF  and the video payload formats include H 261  H 263  H 264  and MPEG 4   Examples of RTP Profiles include   The RTP profile for Audio and video conferences with minimal control  RFC 3551  defines a set of static payload type assignments  and a mechanism for mapping between a payload format  and a payload type identifier  in header  using Session Description Protocol  SDP    The Secure Real time Transport Protocol  SRTP   RFC 3711  defines a profile of RTP that provides cryptographic services for the transfer of payload data   The experimental Control Data Profile for RTP  RTP CDP  for machine to machine communications   3  Packet header  The RTP header has a minimum size of 12 bytes  After the header  optional header extensions may be present  This is followed by the RTP payload  the format of which is determined by the particular class of application  The fields in the header are as follows   Version   2 bits  Indicates the version of the protocol  Current version is 2   P  Padding    1 bit  Used to indicate if there are extra padding bytes at the end of the RTP packet  A padding might be used to fill up a block of certain size  for example as required by an encryption algorithm  The last byte of the padding contains the number of padding bytes that were added  including itself    X  Extension    1 bit  Indicates presence of an Extension header between standard header and payload data  This is application or profile specific   CC  CSRC Count    4 bits  Contains the number of CSRC identifiers  defined below  that follow the fixed header   M  Marker    1 bit  Used at the application level and defined by a profile  If it is set  it means that the current data has some special relevance for the application   PT  Payload Type    7 bits  Indicates the format of the payload and determines its interpretation by the application  This is specified by an RTP profile  For example  see RTP Profile for audio and video conferences with minimal control  RFC 3551    Sequence Number   16 bits  The sequence number is incremented by one for each RTP data packet sent and is to be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence  The RTP does not specify any action on packet loss  it is left to the application to take appropriate action  For example  video applications may play the last known frame in place of the missing frame  According to RFC 3550  the initial value of the sequence number should be random to make known plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult  RTP provides no guarantee of delivery  but the presence of sequence numbers makes it possible to detect missing packets   Timestamp   32 bits  Used to enable the receiver to play back the received samples at appropriate intervals  When several media streams are present  the timestamps are independent in each stream  and may not be relied upon for media synchronization  The granularity of the timing is application specific  For example  an audio application that samples data once every 125 Âµs  8 kHz  a common sample rate in digital telephony  could use that value as its clock resolution  The clock granularity is one of the details that is specified in the RTP profile for an application   SSRC   32 bits  Synchronization source identifier uniquely identifies the source of a stream  The synchronization sources within the same RTP session will be unique   CSRC   32 bits each  Contributing source IDs enumerate contributing sources to a stream which has been generated from multiple sources   Extension header   optional  The first 32 bit word contains a profile specific identifier  16 bits  and a length specifier  16 bits  that indicates the length of the extension  EHL extension header length  in 32 bit units  excluding the 32 bits of the extension header   4  RTP based systems  A complete network based system includes other protocols and standards in conjunction with RTP  Protocols such as SIP  Jingle  RTSP  H 225 and H 245 are used for session initiation  control and termination  Other standards  such as H 264  MPEG and H 263  are used to encode the payload data as specified via RTP Profile   An RTP sender captures the multimedia data  then encodes  frames and transmits it as RTP packets with appropriate timestamps and increasing sequence numbers  Depending on the RTP Profile in use  the sender may set the Payload Type field  The RTP receiver captures the RTP packets  detects missing packets  and may reorder packets  It decodes the frames according to the payload format and presents the stream to its user   5
