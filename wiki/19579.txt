The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system in North America  Flowing entirely in the United States  though its drainage basin reaches into Canada   it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico  With its many tributaries  the Mississippi s watershed drains all or parts of 31 U S  states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains  The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and tenth largest river in the world  The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota  Wisconsin  Iowa  Illinois  Missouri  Kentucky  Tennessee  Arkansas  Mississippi  and Louisiana   Native Americans long lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries  Most were hunter gatherers or herders  but some  such as the Mound builders  formed prolific agricultural societies  The arrival of Europeans in the 1500s changed the native way of life as first explorers  then settlers  ventured into the basin in increasing numbers  The river served first as a barrier – forming borders for New Spain  New France  and the early United States – then as a vital transportation artery and communications link  In the 19th century  during the height of Manifest Destiny  the Mississippi and several western tributaries  most notably the Missouri  formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States   Formed from thick layers of this river s silt deposits  the Mississippi River Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions of the country  which resulted in the river s storied steamboat era  During the American Civil War  the Mississippi s capture by Union forces marked a turning point towards victory because of the river s importance as a route of trade and travel  not least to the Confederacy  Because of substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that supplanted riverboats  the decades following the 1900s saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees  locks and dams  often built in combination   Since modern development of the basin began  the Mississippi has also seen its share of pollution and environmental problems – most notably large volumes of agricultural runoff  which has led to the Gulf of Mexico dead zone off the Delta  In recent years  the river has shown a steady shift towards the Atchafalaya River channel in the Delta  a course change would prove disastrous to seaports such as New Orleans  While a system of dikes and gates has held the Mississippi in its current channel to date  the shift becomes more likely each year due to fluvial processes   1  Name  The word itself comes from Messipi  the French rendering of the Anishinaabe  Ojibwe or Algonquin  name for the river  Misi ziibi  Great River   See below in History section for additional information   In addition to historical traditions shown by names  there are at least two other measures of a river s identity  one being the largest branch  by water volume   and the other being the longest branch  Using the largest branch criterion  the Ohio  not the Middle and Upper Mississippi  would be the main branch of the Lower Mississippi  Using the longest branch criterion  the Middle Mississippi Missouri Jefferson Beaverhead Red Rock Hellroaring Creek River would be the main branch  According to either school of thought  the Upper Mississippi from Lake Itasca  Minnesota to St  Louis  despite its name  would only be a secondary tributary of the final river flowing from Cairo  Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico   While the Missouri River  flowing from the confluence of the Jefferson  Madison and Gallatin Rivers to the Mississippi  is the longest continuously named river in the United States  the serially named river known sequentially as Hellroaring Creek  Red Rock  Beaverhead  Jefferson  Missouri  Middle Mississippi  and Lower Mississippi  as one continuous waterway  is the longest river in North America and the third or fourth longest river in the world  Its length of at least is exceeded only by the Nile  the Amazon  and perhaps the Yangtze River among the longest rivers in the world  The source of this waterway is at Brower s Spring  above sea level in southwestern Montana  along the Continental Divide outside Yellowstone National Park   The Mississippi River is widely considered a convenient if approximate dividing line between the Eastern  Southern  and Midwestern United States and the Western U S   as exemplified by the Gateway Arch in St  Louis and the phrase  Trans Mississippi   as used in the name of the Trans Mississippi Exposition  In the 18th century  the river was the primary western boundary of the young United States   2  Physical geography  The geographical setting of the Mississippi River includes considerations of the course of the river itself  its watershed  its outflow  its prehistoric and historic course changes  and possibilities of future course changes  The New Madrid Seismic Zone along the river is also noteworthy  These various basic geographical aspects of the river in turn underlie its human history and present uses of the waterway and its adjacent lands   2 1  Divisions  The Mississippi River can be divided into three sections  The Upper Mississippi refers to the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the Missouri River  The Middle Mississippi is that part downriver from the Missouri to the Ohio River  And the Lower Mississippi flows from the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico   2 1 1  Upper Mississippi  The Upper Mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the Missouri River at St  Louis  Missouri  The Upper Mississippi is divided into two sections   The headwaters    from the source to Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis  Minnesota  and  A navigable channel  formed by a series of man made lakes between Minneapolis and St  Louis  Missouri  some   The source of the Upper Mississippi branch is traditionally accepted as Lake Itasca  above sea level in Itasca State Park in Clearwater County  Minnesota  The name  Itasca  was chosen to designate the  true head  of the Mississippi River as a combination of the last four letters of the Latin word for truth  veritas  and the first two letters of the Latin word for head  caput   However  the lake is in turn fed by a number of smaller streams   From its origin at Lake Itasca to St  Louis  Missouri  the waterway s flow is moderated by 43 dams  Fourteen of these dams are located above Minneapolis in the headwaters region and serve multiple purposes  including power generation and recreation  The remaining 29 dams  beginning in downtown Minneapolis  all contain locks and were constructed to improve commercial navigation of the upper river  Taken as a whole these 43 dams significantly shape the geography and influence the ecology of the upper river  Beginning just below Saint Paul  Minnesota  and continuing throughout the upper and lower river  the Mississippi is further controlled by thousands of wing dikes that moderate the river s flow in order to maintain an open navigation channel and prevent the river from eroding its banks   The head of navigation on the Mississippi is the Coon Rapids Dam in Coon Rapids  Minnesota  Before it was built in 1913  steamboats could occasionally go upstream as far as Saint Cloud  Minnesota  depending on river conditions   The uppermost lock and dam on the Upper Mississippi River is the Upper St  Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in Minneapolis  Above the dam  the river s elevation is   Below the dam  the river s elevation is   This drop is the largest of all the Mississippi River locks and dams  The origin of the dramatic drop is a waterfall preserved adjacent to the lock under an apron of concrete  Saint Anthony Falls is the only true waterfall on the entire Mississippi River  The water elevation continues to drop steeply as it passes through the gorge carved by the waterfall   The Upper Mississippi features various natural and artificial lakes  with its widest point being Lake Winnibigoshish  near Grand Rapids  Minnesota  over across  Also of note is Lake Onalaska  created by Lock and Dam No  7   near La Crosse  Wisconsin  over wide  On the other hand  Lake Pepin is natural  formed due to the delta formed by the Chippewa River of Wisconsin as it enters the Upper Mississippi  it is more than wide   By the time the Upper Mississippi reaches Saint Paul  Minnesota  below Lock and Dam No  1  it has dropped more than half its original elevation and is above sea level  From St  Paul to St  Louis  Missouri  the river elevation falls much more slowly  and is controlled and managed as a series of pools created by 26 locks and dams   The Upper Mississippi River is joined by the Minnesota River at Fort Snelling in the Twin Cities  the St  Croix River near Prescott  Wisconsin  the Cannon River near Red Wing  Minnesota  the Zumbro River at Wabasha  Minnesota  the Black  La Crosse  and Root rivers in La Crosse  Wisconsin  the Wisconsin River at Prairie du Chien  Wisconsin  the Rock River at the Quad Cities  the Iowa River near Wapello  Iowa  the Skunk River south of Burlington  Iowa  and the Des Moines River at Keokuk  Iowa  Other major tributaries of the Upper Mississippi include the Crow River in Minnesota  the Chippewa River in Wisconsin  the Maquoketa River and the Wapsipinicon River in Iowa  and the Big Muddy River and Illinois River   The Upper Mississippi is largely a multi thread stream with many bars and islands  From its confluence with the St  Croix River downstream to Dubuque  Iowa  the river is entrenched  with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side  The height of these bluffs decreases to the south of Dubuque  though they are still significant through Savanna  Illinois  This topography contrasts strongly with the Lower Mississippi  which is a meandering river in a broad  flat area  only rarely flowing alongside a bluff  as at Vicksburg  Mississippi    The Upper Mississippi River is home to over 119 species of fish  Some fish include  walleye  sauger  large mouth bass  small mouth bass  and white bass  Northern pike  bluegill and crappie also reside in the Upper Mississippi River  Other fish like channel catfish  flathead catfish  carp  the common shiner  freshwater drum  paddlefish and shovelnose sturgeon also live in these upper Mississippi waters  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has designated much of the Mississippi River in the state as infested waters by the exotic species zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil   2 1 2  Middle Mississippi  The Mississippi River is known as the Middle Mississippi from the Upper Mississippi River s confluence with the Missouri River at St  Louis  Missouri  for to its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo  Illinois   The Middle Mississippi is a relatively free flowing river  From St  Louis to the Ohio River confluence  the Middle Mississippi falls a total of over a distance of for an average rate of   At its confluence with the Ohio River  the Middle Mississippi is above sea level  Apart from the Missouri and Meramec rivers of Missouri and the Kaskaskia River of Illinois  no major tributaries enter the Middle Mississippi River   2 1 3  Lower Mississippi  The Mississippi River is called the Lower Mississippi River from its confluence with the Ohio River to its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico  Measured by water volume  the Lower Mississippi s primary branch is the Ohio River  At the confluence of the Ohio and the Middle Mississippi  the Ohio is the bigger river  with its long term mean discharge at Cairo  Illinois being   while the long term mean discharge of the Mississippi at Thebes  Illinois  just upriver from Cairo  is   Thus  by volume  the main branch of the Mississippi River system at Cairo can be considered to be the Ohio River  and the Allegheny River further upstream   rather than the Middle Mississippi   In addition to the Ohio River  the major tributaries of the Lower Mississippi River are the White River  flowing in at the White River National Wildlife Refuge in east central Arkansas  the Arkansas River  joining the Mississippi at Arkansas Post  the Big Black River in Mississippi  the Yazoo River  meeting the Mississippi at Vicksburg  Mississippi  and the Red River in Louisiana  The widest point of the Mississippi River is in the Lower Mississippi portion where it exceeds in width in several places   Deliberate water diversion at the Old River Control Structure in Louisiana allows the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana to be a major distributary of the Mississippi River  with 30% of the Mississippi flowing to the Gulf of Mexico by this route  rather than continuing down the Mississippi s current channel past Baton Rouge and New Orleans on a longer route to the Gulf   2 2  Watershed  The Mississippi River has the world s fourth largest drainage basin   watershed  or  catchment    The basin covers more than   including all or parts of 31 U S  states and two Canadian provinces  The drainage basin empties into the Gulf of Mexico  part of the Atlantic Ocean  The total catchment of the Mississippi River covers nearly 40% of the landmass of the continental United States  The highest point within the watershed is also the highest point of the Rocky Mountains  Mount Elbert at    In the United States  the Mississippi River drains the majority of the area between crest of the Rocky Mountains and the crest of the Appalachian Mountains  except for various regions drained to Hudson Bay by the Red River of the North  to the Atlantic Ocean by the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River  and to the Gulf of Mexico by the Rio Grande  the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers  the Chattahoochee and Appalachicola rivers  and various smaller coastal waterways along the Gulf   The Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico about downstream from New Orleans  Measurements of the length of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico vary somewhat  but the United States Geological Survey s number is   The retention time from Lake Itasca to the Gulf is typically about 90 days   2 3  Outflow  The Mississippi River discharges at an annual average rate of between 200 and 700 thousand cubic feet per second  7 000–20 000 m3 s   Although it is the 5th largest river in the world by volume  this flow is a mere fraction of the output of the Amazon  which moves nearly 7 million cubic feet per second  200 000 m3 s  during wet seasons  On average  the Mississippi has only 8% the flow of the Amazon River   Fresh river water flowing from the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately  The images from NASA s MODIS  to the right  show a large plume of fresh water  which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter blue surrounding waters  These images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately  Instead  it stayed intact as it flowed through the Gulf of Mexico  into the Straits of Florida  and entered the Gulf Stream  The Mississippi River water rounded the tip of Florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of Georgia before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by MODIS   Prior to 1900  the Mississippi River transported an estimated 400 million metric tons of sediment per year from the interior of the United States to coastal Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico  During the last two decades  this number was only 145 million metric tons per year  The reduction in sediment transported down the Mississippi River is the result of engineering modification of the Mississippi  Missouri  and Ohio rivers and their tributaries by dams  meander cutoffs  river training structures  and bank revetments and soil erosion control programs in the areas drained by them   2 4  Course changes  Over geologic time  the Mississippi River has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course  as well as additions  deletions  and other changes among its numerous tributaries  and the lower Mississippi River has used different pathways as its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico across the delta region   Through a natural process known as avulsion or delta switching  the lower Mississippi River has shifted its final course to the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico every thousand years or so  This occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment begin to clog its channel  raising the river s level and causing it to eventually find a steeper  more direct route to the Gulf of Mexico  The abandoned distributaries diminish in volume and form what are known as bayous  This process has  over the past 5 000 years  caused the coastline of south Louisiana to advance toward the Gulf from   The currently active delta lobe is called the Birdfoot Delta  after its shape  or the Balize Delta  after La Balize  Louisiana  the first French settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi   2 4 1  Prehistoric courses  The current form of the Mississippi River basin was largely shaped by the Laurentide Ice Sheet of the most recent Ice Age  The southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present day United States and Mississippi basin  When the ice sheet began to recede  hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited  creating the flat and fertile landscape of the Mississippi Valley  During the melt  giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the Mississippi watershed  creating such features as the Minnesota River  James River  and Milk River valleys  When the ice sheet completely retreated  many of these  temporary  rivers found paths to Hudson Bay or the Arctic Ocean  leaving the Mississippi Basin with many features  oversized  for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period   Ice sheets during the Illinoian Stage about 300 000 to 132 000 years before present  blocked the Mississippi near Rock Island  Illinois  diverting it to its present channel farther to the west  the current western border of Illinois  The Hennepin Canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi downstream from Rock Island to Hennepin  Illinois  South of Hennepin  to Alton  Illinois  the current Illinois River follows the ancient channel used by the Mississippi River before the Illinoian Stage   2 4 2  Historic course changes  In March 1876  the Mississippi suddenly changed course near the settlement of Reverie  Tennessee  leaving a small part of Tipton County  Tennessee  attached to Arkansas and separated from the rest of Tennessee by the new river channel  Since this event was an avulsion  rather than the effect of incremental erosion and deposition  the state line remains located in the old channel   2 5  New Madrid Seismic Zone  The New Madrid Seismic Zone  along the Mississippi River near New Madrid  Missouri  between Memphis and St  Louis  is related to an aulacogen  failed rift  that formed at the same time as the Gulf of Mexico  This area is still quite active seismically  Four great earthquakes in 1811 and 1812  estimated at approximately 8 on the Richter magnitude scale  had tremendous local effects in the then sparsely settled area  and were felt in many other places in the midwestern and eastern U S  These earthquakes created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee from the altered landscape near the river   3  Cultural geography  3 1  State boundaries  The Mississippi River runs through or along 10 states  from Minnesota to Louisiana  and was used to define portions of these states  borders  with Wisconsin  Illinois  Kentucky  Tennessee  and Mississippi along the east side of the river  and Iowa  Missouri  and Arkansas along its west side  Substantial parts of both Minnesota and Louisiana are on either side of the river  although the Mississippi defines part of the boundary of each of these states   In all of these cases  the middle of the riverbed at the time the borders were established was used as the line to define the borders between adjacent states  In various areas  the river has since shifted  but the state borders have not changed  still following the former bed of the Mississippi River as of their establishment  leaving several small isolated areas of one state across the new river channel  contiguous with the adjacent state  Also  due to a meander in the river  a small part of western Kentucky is contiguous with Tennessee  but isolated from the rest of its state   3 2  Communities along

in Minneapolis  Minnesota where the current Hennepin Avenue Bridge is located  No highway or railroad tunnels cross under the Mississippi River   The first railroad bridge across the Mississippi was built in 1856  It spanned the river between the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois and Davenport  Iowa  Steamboat captains of the day  fearful of competition from the railroads  considered the new bridge a hazard to navigation  Two weeks after the bridge opened  the steamboat Effie Afton rammed part of the bridge  catching it on fire  Legal proceedings ensued  with Abraham Lincoln defending the railroad  The lawsuit went to the Supreme Court of the United States and was eventually ruled in favor of the railroad   Below is a general overview of selected Mississippi bridges which have notable

Navigation and flood control  A clear channel is needed for the barges and other vessels that make the main stem Mississippi one of the great commercial waterways of the world  The task of maintaining a navigation channel is the responsibility of the United States Army Corps of Engineers  which was established in 1802  Earlier projects began as early as 1829 to remove snags  close off secondary channels and excavate rocks and sandbars   Steamboats entered trade in the 1820s  so the period 18301850 became the golden age of steamboats  As there were few roads or rails in the lands of the Louisiana Purchase  river traffic was an ideal solution  Cotton  timber and food came down the river  as did Appalachian coal  The port of New Orleans boomed as it was the trans shipment point to deep sea ocean vessels  As a result  the image of the twin stacked  wedding cake Mississippi steamer entered into American mythology  Steamers worked the entire route from the trickles of Montana  to the Ohio river  down the Missouri and Tennessee  to the main channel of the Mississippi  Only with the arrival of the railroads in the 1880s did steamboat traffic diminish  Steamboats remained a feature until the 1920s  Most have been superseded by pusher tugs  A few survive as icons—the Delta Queen and the River Queen for instance   A series of 29 locks and dams on the upper Mississippi  most of which were built in the 1930s  is designed primarily to maintain a deep channel for commercial barge traffic  The lakes formed are also used for recreational boating and fishing  The dams make the river deeper and wider but do not stop it  No flood control is intended  During periods of high flow  the gates  some of which are submersible  are completely opened and the dams simply cease to function  Below St  Louis  the Mississippi is relatively free flowing  although it is constrained by numerous levees and directed by numerous wing dams   4 1  19th century  In 1829  there were surveys of the two major obstacles on the upper Mississippi  the Des Moines Rapids and the Rock Island Rapids  where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock  The Des Moines Rapids were about 11 mi  18 km  long and just above the mouth of the Des Moines River at Keokuk  Iowa  The Rock Island Rapids were between Rock Island and Moline  Illinois  Both rapids were considered virtually impassable   In 1848  the Illinois and Michigan Canal was built to connect the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan via the Illinois River near Peru  Illinois  The canal allowed shipping between these important waterways  In 1900  the canal was replaced by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal  The second canal  in addition to shipping  also allowed Chicago to address specific health issues  typhoid fever  cholera and other waterborne diseases  by sending its waste down the Illinois and Mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of Lake Michigan   The Corps of Engineers recommended the excavation of a  deep channel at the Des Moines Rapids  but work did not begin until after Lieutenant Robert E  Lee endorsed the project in 1837  The Corps later also began excavating the Rock Island Rapids  By 1866  it had become evident that excavation was impractical  and it was decided to build a canal around the Des Moines Rapids  The canal opened in 1877  but the Rock Island Rapids remained an obstacle  In 1878  Congress authorized the Corps to establish a  deep channel to be obtained by building wing dams which direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel  by closing secondary channels and by dredging  The channel project was complete when the Moline Lock  which bypassed the Rock Island Rapids  opened in 1907   To improve navigation between St  Paul  Minnesota  and Prairie du Chien  Wisconsin  the Corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area  including Lake Winnibigoshish and Lake Pokegama  The dams  which were built beginning in the 1880s  stored spring run off which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth   4 2  20th century  In 1907  Congress authorized a deep channel project on the Mississippi  which was not complete when it was abandoned in the late 1920s in favor of the deep channel project   In 1913  construction was complete on a dam at Keokuk  Iowa  the first dam below St  Anthony Falls  Built by a private power company  Union Electric Company of St  Louis  to generate electricity  originally for Streetcars in St  Louis   the Keokuk dam was one of the largest hydro electric plants in the world at the time  The dam also eliminated the Des Moines Rapids  Lock and Dam No  1 was completed in Minneapolis  Minnesota in 1917  Lock and Dam No  2  near Hastings  Minnesota was completed in 1930   Prior to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927  the Corps  primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river  It was thought that the river s velocity would scour off bottom sediments  deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding  The 1927 flood proved this to be so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to create their own levee breaks to relieve the force of the rising river   The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930 authorized the channel project  which called for a navigation channel 9 feet deep and wide to accommodate multiple barge tows  This was achieved by a series of locks and dams  and by dredging  Twenty three new locks and dams were built on the upper Mississippi in the 1930s in addition to the three already in existence   Until the 1950s  there was no dam below Lock and Dam 26 at Alton  Illinois  Chain of Rocks Lock  Lock and Dam No  27   which consists of a low water dam and an long canal  was added in 1953  just below the confluence with the Missouri River  primarily to bypass a series of rock ledges at St  Louis  It also serves to protect the St  Louis city water intakes during times of low water   U S  government scientists determined in the 1950s that the Mississippi River was starting to switch to the Atchafalaya River channel because of its much steeper path to the Gulf of Mexico  Eventually the Atchafalaya River would capture the Mississippi River and become its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico  leaving New Orleans on a side channel  As a result  the U S  Congress authorized a project called the Old River Control Structure  which has prevented the Mississippi River from leaving its current channel that drains into the Gulf via New Orleans   Because the large scale of high energy water flow threatened to damage the structure  an auxiliary flow control station was built adjacent to the standing control station  This US$300 million project was completed in 1986 by the U S  Army Corps Of Engineers  Beginning in the 1970s  the Corps applied hydrological transport models to analyze flood flow and water quality of the Mississippi  Dam 26 at Alton  Illinois  which had structural problems  was replaced by the Mel Price Lock and Dam in 1990  The original Lock and Dam 26 was demolished   4 3  21st century  The Corps now actively creates and maintains spillways and floodways to divert periodic water surges into backwater channels and lakes  as well as route part of the Mississippi s flow into the Atchafalaya Basin and from there to the Gulf of Mexico  bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans  The main structures are the Birds Point New Madrid Floodway in Missouri  the Old River Control Structure and the Morganza Spillway in Louisiana  which direct excess water down the west and east sides  respectively  of the Atchafalaya River  and the Bonnet Carré Spillway  also in Louisiana  which directs floodwaters to Lake Pontchartrain  see diagram    Some of the pre 1927 strategy is still in use today  with the Corps actively cutting the necks of horseshoe bends  allowing the water to move faster and reducing flood heights   5  History  5 1  Native Americans  The area of the Mississippi River basin was first settled by hunting and gathering Native American peoples and is considered one of the few independent centers of plant domestication in human history  Evidence of early cultivation of sunflower  a goosefoot  a marsh elder and an indigenous squash dates to the 4th millennium BCE  The lifestyle gradually became more settled after around 1000 BCE during what is now called the Woodland period  with increasing evidence of shelter construction  pottery  weaving and other practices  A network of trade routes referred to as the Hopewell interaction sphere was active along the waterways between about 200 and 500 CE  spreading common cultural practices over the entire area between the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes  A period of more isolated communities followed  and agriculture introduced from Mesoamerica based on the Three Sisters  maize  beans and squash  gradually came to dominate  After around 800 CE there arose an advanced agricultural society today referred to as the Mississippian culture  with evidence of highly stratified complex chiefdoms and large population centers  The most prominent of these  now called Cahokia  was occupied between about 600 and 1400 CE and at its peak numbered between 8 000 and 40 000 inhabitants  larger than London  England of that time  At the time of first contact with Europeans  Cahokia and many other Mississippian cities had dispersed  and archaeological finds attest to increased social stress  Modern American Indian nations inhabiting the Mississippi basin include Cheyenne  Sioux  Ojibwe  Potawatomi  Ho Chunk  Fox  Kickapoo  Tamaroa  Moingwena  Quapaw and Chickasaw   The word Mississippi itself comes from Messipi  the French rendering of the Anishinaabe  Ojibwe or Algonquin  name for the river  Misi ziibi  Great River   The Ojibwe called Lake Itasca Omashkoozo zaaga igan  Elk Lake  and the river flowing out of it Omashkoozo ziibi  Elk River   After flowing into Lake Bemidji  the Ojibwe called the river Bemijigamaag ziibi  River from the Traversing Lake   After flowing into Cass Lake  the name of the river changes to Gaa miskwaawaakokaag ziibi  Red Cedar River  and then out of Lake Winnibigoshish as Wiinibiigoonzhish ziibi  Miserable Wretched Dirty Water River   Gichi ziibi  Big River  after the confluence with the Leech Lake River  then finally as Misi ziibi  Great River  after the confluence with the Crow Wing River  After the expeditions by Giacomo Beltrami and Henry Schoolcraft  the longest stream above the juncture of the Crow Wing River and Gichi ziibi was named  Mississippi River   The Mississippi River Band of Chippewa Indians  known as the Gichi ziibiwininiwag  are named after the stretch of the Mississippi River known as the Gichi ziibi  The Cheyenne  one of the earliest inhabitants of the upper Mississippi River  called it the Máʼxe éʼometaaʼe  Big Greasy River  in the Cheyenne language  The Arapaho name for the river is Beesniicíe  The Pawnee name is Kickaátit   5 2  European exploration  On May 8  1541  Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto became the first recorded European to reach the Mississippi River  which he called Río del Espíritu Santo   River of the Holy Spirit    in the area of what is now Mississippi  In Spanish  the river is called Río Mississippi   French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began exploring the Mississippi in the 17th century  Marquette traveled with a Sioux Indian who named it Ne Tongo   Big river  in Sioux language  in 1673  Marquette proposed calling it the River of the Immaculate Conception   When Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi Valley in the 17th century  natives guided him to a quicker way to return to French Canada via the Illinois River  When he found the Chicago Portage  he remarked that a canal of  only half a league   less than 2 miles  3 2 km   3 km  would join the Mississippi and the Great Lakes  In 1848  the continental divide separating the waters of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley was breached by the Illinois and Michigan canal via the Chicago River  This both accelerated the development  and forever changed the ecology of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes   In 1682  René Robert Cavelier  Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti claimed the entire Mississippi River Valley for France  calling the river Colbert River after Jean Baptiste Colbert and the region La Louisiane  for King Louis XIV  On March 2  1699  Pierre Le Moyne d Iberville rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi  following the death of La Salle  The French built the small fort of La Balise there to control passage   In 1718  about upriver  New Orleans was established along the river crescent by Jean Baptiste Le Moyne  Sieur de Bienville  with construction patterned after the 1711 resettlement on Mobile Bay of Mobile  the capital of French Louisiana at the time   In 1762 the entire region is part of the Spanish Louisiana from southern Canada to the Gulf of Mexico until 1802   5 3  Colonization  Following Britain s victory in the Seven Years War the Mississippi became the border between the British and Spanish Empires  The Treaty of Paris  1763  gave Great Britain rights to all land east of the Mississippi and Spain rights to land west of the Mississippi  Spain also ceded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba  which the British occupied during the war  Britain then divided the territory into East and West Florida   Article 8 of the Treaty of Paris  1783  states   The navigation of the river Mississippi  from its source to the ocean  shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States   With this treaty  which ended the American Revolutionary War  Britain also ceded West Florida back to Spain to regain the Bahamas  which Spain had occupied during the war  In 1800  under duress from Napoleon of France  Spain ceded an undefined portion of West Florida to France  When France then sold the Louisiana Territory to the U S  in 1803  a dispute arose again between Spain and the U S  on which parts of West Florida exactly had Spain ceded to France  which would in turn decide which parts of West Florida were now U S  property versus Spanish property  These aspirations ended when Spain was pressured into signing Pinckney s Treaty in 1795   France reacquired  Louisiana  from Spain in the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800  The United States then bought the territory from France in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803  In 1815  the U S  defeated Britain at the Battle of New Orleans  part of the War of 1812  securing American control of the river  So many settlers traveled westward through the Mississippi river basin  as well as settled in it  that Zadok Cramer wrote a guide book called The Navigator  detailing the features and dangers and navigable waterways of the area  It was so popular that he updated and expanded it through 12 editions over a period of 25 years   The colonization of the area was barely slowed by the three earthquakes in 1811 and 1812  estimated at approximately 8 on the Richter magnitude scale  that were centered near New Madrid  Missouri   5 4  Steamboat era  Mark Twain s book  Life on the Mississippi  covered the steamboat commerce which took place from 1830 to 1870 on the river before more modern ships replaced the steamer  The book was published first in serial form in Harper s Weekly in seven parts in 1875  The full version  including a passage from the then unfinished Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and works from other authors  was published by James R  Osgood & Company in 1885   The first steamboat to travel the full length of the Lower Mississippi from the Ohio River to New Orleans was the New Orleans in December 1811  Its maiden voyage occurred during the series of New Madrid earthquakes in 1811–12  Steamboat transport remained a viable industry  both in terms of passengers and freight until the end of the first decade of the 20th century  Among the several Mississippi River system steamboat companies was the noted Anchor Line  which  from 1859 to 1898  operated a luxurious fleet of steamers between St  Louis and New Orleans   5 5  Civil War  Control of the river was a strategic objective of both sides in the American Civil War  In 1862 Union forces coming down the river successfully cleared Confederate defenses at Island Number 10 and Memphis  Tennessee  while Naval forces coming upriver from the Gulf of Mexico captured New Orleans  Louisiana  The remaining major Confederate stronghold was on the heights overlooking the river at Vicksburg  Mississippi  and the Union s Vicksburg Campaign  December 1862 to July 1863   and the fall of Port Hudson  completed control of the lower Mississippi River  The Union victory ending the Siege of Vicksburg on July 4  1863  was pivotal to the Union s final victory of the Civil War   5 6  20th and 21st centuries  The  Big Freeze  of 1918–19 blocked river traffic north of Memphis  Tennessee  preventing transportation of coal from southern Illinois  This resulted in widespread shortages  high prices  and rationing of coal in January and February   In the spring of 1927  the river broke out of its banks in 145 places  during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and inundated to a depth of up to    In 1962 and 1963  industrial accidents spilled of soybean oil into the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers  The oil covered the Mississippi River from St  Paul to Lake Pepin  creating an ecological disaster and a demand to control water pollution   On October 20  1976  the automobile ferry  MV George Prince  was struck by a ship traveling upstream as the ferry attempted to cross from Destrehan  Louisiana  to Luling  Louisiana  Seventy eight passengers and crew died  only eighteen survived the accident   In 1988  record low water levels provided an opportunity and obligation to examine the climax of the wooden hulled age  The Mississippi fell to below zero on the Memphis gauge  Water craft remains were exposed in an area of on the bottom of the Mississippi River at West Memphis  Arkansas  They dated to the late 19th to early 20th centuries  The State of Arkansas  the Arkansas Archeological Survey  and the Arkansas Archeological Society responded with a two month data recovery effort  The fieldwork received national media attention as good news in the middle of a drought   The Great Flood of 1993 was another significant flood  primarily affecting the Mississippi above its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo  Illinois   Two portions of the Mississippi were designated as American Heritage Rivers in 1997  the lower portion around Louisiana and Tennessee  and the upper portion around Iowa  Illinois  Minnesota and Missouri   In 2002  Slovenian long distance swimmer Martin Strel swam the entire length of the river  from Minnesota to Louisiana  over the course of 68 days  In 2005  the Source to Sea Expedition paddled the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers to benefit the Audubon Society s Upper Mississippi River Campaign   5 7  Future  Geologists believe that the lower Mississippi could take a new course to the Gulf  Either of two new routes – through the Atchafalaya Basin or through Lake Pontchartrain — might become the Mississippi s main channel if flood control structures are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe flood   Failure of the Old River Control Structure  the Morganza Spillway  or nearby levees would likely re route the main channel of the Mississippi through Louisiana s Atchafalaya Basin and down the Atchafalaya River to reach the Gulf of Mexico south of Morgan City in southern Louisiana  This route provides a more direct path to the Gulf of Mexico than the present Mississippi River channel through Baton Rouge and New Orleans  While the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event  such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction  maintenance  and operation of various levees  spillways  and other control structures by the U S  Army Corps of Engineers   The Old River Control Structure  between the present Mississippi River channel and the Atchafalaya Basin  sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30% of the Mississippi s flow to the Atchafalaya River  There is a steep drop here away from the Mississippi s main channel into the Atchafalaya Basin  If this facility were to fail during a major flood  there is a strong concern the water would scour and erode the river bottom enough to capture the Mississippi s main channel  The structure was nearly lost during the 1973 flood  but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play  In particular  the Corps of Engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity  These additional facilities give the Corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973  which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods  such as that of 2011   Because the Morganza Spillway is located at slightly higher elevation well back from the river  it is normally dry on both sides  Even if this structure were to fail at the crest during a severe flood  the flood waters would have to cause a significant amount of erosion  down to normal water levels  before the Mississippi could permanently jump channel at this location  During the 2011 floods  the Corps of Engineers decided to open the Morganza Spillway to 1 4 of its capacity to allow 150 000 ft3 sec of water to flood the Morganza and Atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the Gulf of Mexico  bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans  In addition to reducing the Mississippi River crest downstream  this diversion reduced the chances of a channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system   Some geologists have noted that the possibility for course change into the Atchafalaya also exists in the area immediately north of the Old River Control Structure  Army Corps of Engineers geologist Fred Smith once stated   The Mississippi wants to go west  1973 was a forty year flood  The big one lies out there somewhere—when the structures can t release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way  That is when the river s going to jump its banks and try to break through    Another possible course change for the Mississippi River is a diversion into Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans  This route is controlled by the Bonnet Carré Spillway  built to reduce flooding in New Orleans  This spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 4–6 meters  12 to 20 feet  high are all that prevents the Mississippi from taking a new  shorter course through Lake Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico  Diversion of the Mississippi s main channel through Lake Pontchartrain would have consequences similar to an Atchafalaya diversion  but to a lesser extent  since the present river channel would remain in use past Baton Rouge and into the New Orleans area   6  Recreation  The sport of water skiing was invented on the river in a wide region between Minnesota and Wisconsin known as Lake Pepin  Ralph Samuelson of Lake City  Minnesota  created and refined his skiing technique in late June and early July 1922  He later performed the first water ski jump in 1925 and was pulled along at by a Curtiss flying boat later that year   There are seven National Park Service sites along the Mississippi River  The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is the National Park Service site dedicated to protecting and interpreting the Mississippi River itself  The other six National Park Service sites along the river are  listed from north to south    Effigy Mounds National Monument  Jefferson National Expansion Memorial  AKA  The Arch   Vicksburg National Military Park  Natchez National Historical Park  New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park  Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve  7  Cultural references  7 1  Literature  William Faulkner uses the Mississippi River and Delta as the setting for many hunts throughout his novels  It has been proposed that in Faulkner s famous story  The Bear  young Ike first begins his transformation into a man  thus relinquishing his birthright to land in Yoknapatawpha County through his realizations found within the woods surrounding the Mississippi River   Many of the works of Mark Twain deal with or take place near the Mississippi River  One of his first major works  Life on the Mississippi  is in part a history of the river  in part a memoir of Twain s experiences on the river  and a collection of tales that either take place on or are associated with the river  The river was noted for the number of bandits which called its islands and shores home  including John Murrell who was a well known murderer  horse stealer and slave  re trader   His notoriety was such that author Twain devoted an entire chapter to him in Life on the Mississippi  and Murrell was rumored to have an island headquarters on the river at Island 37  Twain s most famous work  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  is largely a journey down the river  The novel works as an episodic meditation on American culture with the river having multiple different meanings including independence  escape  freedom  and adventure   Herman Melville s novel The Confidence Man portrayed a Canterbury Tales style group of steamboat passengers whose interlocking stories are told as they travel down the Mississippi River  The novel is written both as cultural satire and a metaphysical treatise  Like Huckleberry Finn  it uses the Mississippi River as a metaphor for the larger aspects of American and human identity that unify the otherwise disparate characters  The river s fluidity is reflected by the often shifting personalities and identities of Melville s  confidence man    Much of Edna Ferber s 1926 novel Show Boat takes place on the Mississippi River  The novel is the basis for the celebrated 1927 musical play by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II   7 2  Music  The song  When the Levee Breaks   made famous in the version performed by Led Zeppelin on the album Led Zeppelin IV  was composed by Memphis Minnie McCoy in 1929 after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927  Another song about the flood was  Louisiana 1927  by Randy Newman for the album Good Old Boys   Ferde Grofé composed a set of movements for symphony orchestra entitled  Mississippi Suite   based on the lands the river travels through   The stage and movie musical Show Boat s central musical piece is the spiritual influenced ballad  Ol  Man River   Its composer  Jerome Kern  also composed an orchestral piece entitled  Mark Twain Suite    The musical Big River is based on the travels of Huckleberry Finn down the river   The Johnny Cash song  Big River  is about the Mississippi River  and about drifting the length of the river to pursue a relationship that fails  The places mentioned in the song are Saint Paul  Davenport  St  Louis  Memphis  Baton Rouge and New Orleans    Roll On Mississippi  and  Mississippi Cotton Picking Delta Town  are two classics from Charley Pride that refer to the Mississippi River   The late Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn collaborated on the song Louisiana Woman  Mississippi Man   8  See also  Mississippi River floods  Atchafalaya Basin  Capes on the Mississippi River  Chemetco  List of locks and dams of the Upper Mississippi River  List of longest main stem
