Tyrus Raymond  Ty  Cobb  December 18  1886 – July 17  1961   nicknamed  The Georgia Peach   was an American Major League Baseball  MLB  outfielder  He was born in rural Narrows  Georgia  Cobb spent 22 seasons with the Detroit Tigers  the last six as the team s player manager  and finished his career with the Philadelphia Athletics  In 1936 Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame ballot  receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes   Cobb is widely credited with setting 90 MLB records during his career  He still holds several records as of the end of the 2013 season  including the highest career batting average   366 or  367  depending on source  and most career batting titles with 11  or 12  depending on source   He retained many other records for almost a half century or more  including most career hits until 1985  4 189 or 4 191  depending on source   most career runs  2 245 or 2 246 depending on source  until 2001  most career games played  3 035  and at bats  11 429 or 11 434 depending on source  until 1974  and the modern record for most career stolen bases  892  until 1977  He still holds the career record for stealing home  54 times   and was the youngest player to compile 4 000 hits and score 2 000 runs  Cobb ranks fifth all time in number of games played and committed 271 errors  the most by any American League  AL  outfielder   Cobb s legacy as an athlete has sometimes been overshadowed by his surly temperament  racism  and aggressive playing style  which was described by the Detroit Free Press as  daring to the point of dementia   Cobb himself wrote shortly before his death   In legend I am a sadistic  slashing  swashbuckling despot who waged war in the guise of sport   Cobb was notorious for sliding into bases feet first  with his spikes high   Cobb s legacy  which includes a college scholarship fund for Georgia residents financed by his early investments in Coca Cola and General Motors  has been tarnished by allegations of racism and violence  Cobb s reputation as an extremely violent man was fanned by his first biographer  sportswriter Al Stump  whose views have been partially discredited as sensationalized and  in some part  fictional  while Cobb s views on race evolved and mellowed after his retirement from baseball  In the 1994 biopic Cobb  actor Tommy Lee Jones depicts an aging Cobb assisting the writing of Stump s biography   1  Early life  Cobb was born in 1886 in Narrows  Georgia  a small rural community of farmers that was not an official city or village at the time  He was the first of three children born to William Herschel Cobb  1863 1905  and Amanda Chitwood Cobb  1871 1936   When he was still an infant  his parents moved to nearby Royston  where he was raised  By most accounts  he became fascinated with baseball as a child  and decided he wanted to play professional ball one day  his father was vehemently opposed to this idea  but by his teen years  he was trying out for area teams  He played his first years in organized baseball for the Royston Rompers  the semi pro Royston Reds  and the Augusta Tourists of the South Atlantic League who released him after only two days  He then tried out for the Anniston Steelers of the semipro Tennessee Alabama League  with his father s stern admonition ringing in his ears   Don t come home a failure   After joining the Steelers for a monthly salary of $50  Cobb promoted himself by sending several postcards written about his talents under different aliases to Grantland Rice  the sports editor of the Atlanta Journal  Eventually  Rice wrote a small note in the Journal that a  young fellow named Cobb seems to be showing an unusual lot of talent   After about three months  Cobb returned to the Tourists and finished the season hitting  237 in 35 games  In August 1905  the management of the Tourists sold Cobb to the American League s Detroit Tigers for $750  equivalent to approximately $ in today s funds    On August 8  1905  Cobb s mother fatally shot his father with a pistol that his father had purchased for her  Court records indicate that Mr  Cobb had suspected his wife of infidelity and was sneaking past his own bedroom window to catch her in the act  She saw the silhouette of what she presumed to be an intruder and  acting in self defense  shot and killed her husband  Mrs  Cobb was charged with murder and then released on a $7 000 recognizance bond  She was acquitted on March 31  1906  Cobb later attributed his ferocious play to his late father  saying   I did it for my father  He never got to see me play    but I knew he was watching me  and I never let him down    In 1911  Cobb moved to Detroit s architecturally significant and now historically protected Woodbridge neighborhood  from which he would walk with his dogs to the ballpark prior to games  The Victorian duplex in which Cobb lived still stands   2  Major league career  2 1  The early years  Three weeks after his mother killed his father  Cobb debuted in center field for the Detroit Tigers  On August 30  1905  in his first major league at bat  he doubled off of Jack Chesbro of the New York Highlanders  Chesbro had won a record 41 games the previous season  Cobb was 18 years old at the time  the youngest player in the league by almost a year  Although he hit  240 in 41 games  he signed a lucrative $1 500 contract from the Tigers for 1906   Although rookie hazing was customary  Cobb could not endure it in good humor and soon became alienated from his teammates  He later attributed his hostile temperament to this experience   These old timers turned me into a snarling wildcat   Tigers manager Hughie Jennings later acknowledged that Cobb was targeted for abuse by veteran players  some of whom sought to force him off the team   I let this go for a while because I wanted to satisfy myself that Cobb has as much guts as I thought in the very beginning   Jennings recalled   Well  he proved it to me  and I told the other players to let him alone  He is going to be a great baseball player and I won t allow him to be driven off this club    The following year  1906  Cobb became the Tigers  full time center fielder and hit  316 in 98 games  setting a record for the highest batting average  minimum 310 plate appearances  for a 19 year old  later bested by Mel Ott s  322 average in 124 games for the 1928 New York Giants  He never hit below that mark again  After being moved to right field  he led the Tigers to three consecutive American League pennants in 1907  1908 & 1909  Detroit would lose each World Series  to the Cubs twice and then the Pirates   however  with Cobb s postseason numbers much below his career standard  Cobb did not get another opportunity to play on a pennant winning team   In 1907  Cobb reached first and then stole second  third and home  He accomplished the feat four more times during his career  He finished the 1907 season with a league leading  350 batting average  212 hits  49 steals and 119 runs batted in  RBI   At age 20  he was the youngest player to win a batting championship and held this record until 1955  when fellow Detroit Tiger Al Kaline won the batting title twelve days younger than Cobb when he did it  Reflecting on his career in 1930  two years after retiring  he told Grantland Rice   The biggest thrill I ever got came in a game against the Athletics in 1907  on September 30     The Athletics had us beaten  with Rube Waddell pitching  They were two runs ahead in the 9th inning  when I happened to hit a home run that tied the score  This game went 17 innings to a tie  and a few days later  we clinched our first pennant  You can understand what it meant for a 20 year old country boy to hit a home run off the great Rube  in a pennant winning game with two outs in the ninth    Despite great success on the field  Cobb was no stranger to controversy off it  As described in Smithsonian Magazine   In 1907 during spring training in Augusta  Georgia  a black groundskeeper named Bungy  whom Cobb had known for years  attempted to shake Cobb’s hand or pat him on the shoulder   The  overly familiar greeting infuriated  Cobb  who attacked Bungy  When Bungy s wife tried to defend him  Cobb choked her  The assault was only stopped when catcher Charles  Boss  Schmidt knocked Cobb out  In 1908  Cobb attacked a black laborer in Detroit who complained when Cobb stepped into freshly poured asphalt  Cobb was found guilty of battery but the sentence was suspended   In September 1907  Cobb began a relationship with The Coca Cola Company that lasted the remainder of his life  By the time he died  he held over 20 000 shares of stock and owned bottling plants in Santa Maria  California  Twin Falls  Idaho  and Bend  Oregon   He was also a celebrity spokesman for the product  In the offseason between 1907 and 1908  Cobb negotiated with Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina  offering to coach baseball there  for $250 a month  provided that he did not sign with Detroit that season   This did not come to pass  however   The following season  the Tigers finished ahead of the Chicago White Sox for the pennant  Cobb again won the batting title with a  324 average  but Detroit suffered another loss in the World Series  In August 1908  Cobb married Charlotte   Charlie   Marion Lombard  the daughter of prominent Augustan Roswell Lombard  In the offseason  the couple lived on her father s Augusta estate  The Oaks  until they moved into their own house on Williams Street in November 1913   The Tigers won the AL pennant again in   During the Series  Cobb stole home in the second game  igniting a three run rally  but that was the high point for him  finishing with a lowly  231 in his last World Series as the Tigers lost to Honus Wagner and the powerful Pirates in seven games  Although he performed poorly in the postseason  he won the Triple Crown by hitting  377 with 107 RBI and nine home runs  all inside the park  thus becoming the only player of the modern era to lead his league in home runs in a season without hitting a ball over the fence   In the same season  Charles M  Conlon snapped the famous photograph of a grimacing Cobb sliding into third base amid a cloud of dirt  which visually captured the grit and ferocity of his playing style   2 2  1910  Chalmers Award controversy  Going into the final days of the season  Cobb had an  004 lead on Nap Lajoie for the American League batting title  The prize for the winner of the title was a Chalmers automobile  Cobb sat out the final games to preserve his average  Lajoie hit safely eight times in a doubleheader  but six of those hits were bunt singles  Later it was rumored that the opposing manager had instructed his third baseman to play extra deep to allow Lajoie to win the batting race over the generally disliked Cobb  Although Cobb was credited with a higher batting average  it was later discovered that one game was counted twice so that Cobb actually lost to Lajoie   As a result of the incident  AL president Ban Johnson was forced to arbitrate the situation  He declared Cobb the rightful owner of the title  but car company president Hugh Chalmers chose to award one to both Cobb and Lajoie   2 3  1911 season and onward  Cobb regarded baseball as  something like a war   future Tiger second baseman Charlie Gehringer said   Every time at bat for him was a crusade   Baseball historian John Thorn said   He is testament to how far you can get simply through will    Cobb was pursued by demons    Cobb was having a tremendous year in   which included a 40 game hitting streak  Still   Shoeless  Joe Jackson led him by  009 points in the batting race late in the season  Near the end of the season  Cobb’s Tigers had a long series against Jackson s Cleveland Naps  Fellow Southerners Cobb and Jackson were personally friendly both on and off the field  Cobb used that friendship to his advantage  Cobb ignored Jackson when Jackson tried to say anything to him  When Jackson persisted  Cobb snapped angrily back at him  making him wonder what he could have done to enrage Cobb  who felt that it was these mind games that caused Jackson to  fall off  to a final average of  408  twelve points lower than Cobb s  420  a twentieth century record which stood until George Sisler tied it and Rogers Hornsby surpassed it with  424  the record since then except for Hugh Duffy s  438 in the nineteenth century   Cobb led the AL that year in numerous other categories  including 248 hits  147 runs scored  127 RBI  83 stolen bases  47 doubles  24 triples and a  621 slugging percentage  Cobb hit eight home runs but finished second in that category to Frank Baker  who hit eleven  He was awarded another Chalmers car  this time for being voted the AL MVP by the Baseball Writers Association of America   On May 12  1911  Cobb s play illustrated his combination of skill and cunning  Playing against the New York Highlanders  he scored from first base on a single to right field  then scored another run from second base on a wild pitch  In the seventh inning  he tied the game with a two run double  The Highlanders catcher vehemently argued the safe call at second base with the umpire in question  going on at such length that the other Highlanders infielders gathered nearby to watch  Realizing that no one on the Highlanders had called time  Cobb strolled unobserved to third base  and then casually walked towards home plate as if to get a better view of the argument  He then suddenly broke into a run and slid into home plate for the eventual winning run  It was performances like this that led Branch Rickey to say later that Cobb  had brains in his feet    Describing his gameplay strategy in 1930  he said   My system was all offense  I believed in putting up a mental hazard for the other fellow  If we were five or six runs ahead  I d try some wild play  such as going from first to home on a single  This helped to make the other side hurry the play in a close game later on  I worked out all the angles I could think of  to keep them guessing and hurrying   In the same interview  Cobb talked about having noticed a throwing tendency of first baseman Hal Chase  but having to wait two full years until the opportunity came to exploit it  By unexpectedly altering his own baserunning tendencies  he was able to surprise Chase and score the winning run of the game in question   On May 15  1912  Cobb assaulted a heckler  Claude Lueker  in the stands in New York s Polo Grounds where his Tigers were playing the Highlanders  Lueker and Cobb had traded insults with each other through the first three innings  and the situation climaxed when Lueker called Cobb a  half nigger   Cobb  in his discussion of the incident in the Holmes biography  avoided such explicit words but alluded to Lueker s epithet by saying he was  reflecting on my mother s color and morals   He went on to state that he warned Highlander manager Harry Wolverton that if something wasn t done about that man  there would be trouble  No action was taken  At the end of the sixth inning  after being challenged by teammates Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty to do something about it  Cobb climbed into the stands and attacked Lueker  who it turns out was handicapped  he had lost all of one hand and three fingers on his other hand in an industrial accident   When onlookers shouted at him to stop because the man had no hands  he reportedly retorted   I don t care if he got no feet    The league suspended him  and his teammates  though not fond of Cobb  went on strike to protest the suspension  and the lack of protection of players from abusive fans  before the May 18 game in Philadelphia  For that one game  Detroit fielded a replacement team made up of hastily recruited college and sandlot players plus two Tiger coaches and  not surprisingly  lost  24–2  thereby setting some of Major League Baseball s modern era  post 1900  negative records  notably the 26 hits in a nine inning game allowed by Allan Travers  who pitched one of the sport s most unlikely complete games  The pre 1901 record for the most hits and runs given up in a game is held by the Cleveland Blues  Dave Rowe  Primarily an outfielder  Rowe pitched a complete game on July 24  1882  giving up 35 runs on 29 hits  The current post 1900 record for most hits in a nine inning game is 31  set in 1992 by the Milwaukee Brewers against Toronto  however  the Blue Jays used six pitchers   The strike ended when Cobb urged his teammates to return to the field  According to him  this incident led to the formation of a players  union  the  Ballplayers  Fraternity   formally  the Fraternity of Professional Baseball Players of America   an early version of what is now called the Major League Baseball Players Association  which garnered some concessions from the owners   Cobb  during his career  was involved in numerous other fights  both on and off the field  and several profanity laced shouting matches  For example  Cobb and umpire Billy Evans arranged to settle their in game differences through fisticuffs under the grandstand after the game  Members of both teams were spectators  and broke up the scuffle after Cobb had knocked Evans down  pinned him and began choking him  He once slapped a black elevator operator for being  uppity   When a black night watchman intervened  he pulled out a knife and stabbed him  The matter was later settled out of court   2 4  1915–1921  In 1915  Cobb set the single season record for stolen bases with 96  which stood until Dodger Maury Wills broke it in 1962  Cobb’s streak of five batting titles  believed at the time to be nine straight  ended the following year when he finished second with  371 to Tris Speaker’s  386   In 1917  Cobb hit in 35 consecutive games  still the only player with two 35 game hitting streaks  including his 40 game streak in 1911   He had six hitting streaks of at least 20 games in his career  second only to Pete Rose s seven   Also in 1917  Cobb starred in the motion picture Somewhere in Georgia for a sum of $25 000 plus expenses  equivalent to approximately $ today    Based on a story by sports columnist Grantland Rice  the film casts Cobb as  himself   a small town Georgian bank clerk with a talent for baseball  Broadway critic Ward Morehouse called the movie  absolutely the worst flicker I ever saw  pure hokum    In October 1918  Cobb enlisted in the Chemical Corps branch of the United States Army and was sent to the Allied Expeditionary Forces headquarters in Chaumont  France  He served approximately 67 days overseas before receiving an honorable discharge and returning to the United States  He was given the rank of captain underneath the command of Major Branch Rickey  the president of the St  Louis Cardinals  Other baseball players serving in this unit included Captain Christy Mathewson and Lieutenant George Sisler  All of these men were assigned to the Gas and Flame Division  where they trained soldiers in preparation for chemical attacks by exposing them to gas chambers in a controlled environment  which was eventually responsible for Mathewson s contracting tuberculosis which led to his premature death on the eve of the 1925 World Series   On August 19  1921  in the second game of a doubleheader against Elmer Myers of the Boston Red Sox  Cobb collected his 3 000th hit  Aged 34 at the time  he is still the youngest ballplayer to reach that milestone  and in the fewest at bats  8 093    By   Babe Ruth  newly sold to the newly named New York Yankees from the Boston Red Sox  had established himself as a power hitter  something Cobb was not considered to be  When his Tigers showed up in New York to play the Yankees for the first time that season  writers billed it as a showdown between two stars of competing styles of play  Ruth hit two homers and a triple during the series  compared to Cobb s one single   As Ruth s popularity grew  Cobb became increasingly hostile toward him  He saw the Babe not only as a threat to his style of play  but also to his style of life  While Cobb preached ascetic self denial  Ruth gorged on hot dogs  beer and women  Perhaps what angered him the most about Ruth was that despite Babe s total disregard for his physical condition and traditional baseball  he was still an overwhelming success and brought fans to the ballparks in record numbers to see him challenge his own slugging records   After enduring several years of seeing his fame and notoriety usurped by Ruth  Cobb decided that he was going to show that swinging for the fences was no challenge for a top hitter  On May 5  1925  he began a two game hitting spree better than any even Ruth had unleashed  Sitting in the Tiger dugout  he told a reporter that  for the first time in his career  he was going to swing for the fences  That day  he went 6 for 6  with two singles  a double and three home runs  The 16 total bases set a new AL record  which stood until May 8  2012 when Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers hit four home runs and a double for a total of 18 bases  The next day he had three more hits  two of which were home runs  The single his first time up gave him nine consecutive hits over three games  His five homers in two games tied the record set by Cap Anson of the old Chicago NL team in 1884  Cobb wanted to show that he could hit home runs when he wanted  but simply chose not to do so  At the end of the series  the 38 year old veteran superstar had gone 12 for 19 with 29 total bases and then went happily back to his usual bunting and hitting and running  For his part  Ruth s attitude was that  I could have had a lifetime  600 average  but I would have had to hit them singles  The people were paying to see me hit home runs   Even so  when asked in 1930 by Grantland Rice to name the best hitter he d ever seen  Cobb answered   You can t beat the Babe  Ruth is one of the few who can take a terrific swing and still meet the ball solidly  His timing is perfect   No one has  the combined power and eye of Ruth    2 5  Cobb as player manager  Tiger owner Frank Navin tapped Cobb to take over for Hughie Jennings as manager for the season  a deal he signed on his 34th birthday for $32 500  equivalent to approximately $ in today s funds   The signing surprised the baseball world  Although Cobb was a legendary player  he was disliked throughout the baseball community  even by his own teammates  and he expected as much from his players since he set a standard most players couldn t meet   The closest Cobb came to winning another pennant was in   when the Tigers finished in third place  six games behind the pennant winning Washington Senators  The Tigers had also finished third in   but 16 games behind the Yankees  Cobb blamed his lackluster managerial record  479 wins against 444 losses  on Navin  who was arguably even more frugal than he was  passing up a number of quality players Cobb wanted to add to the team  In fact  he had saved money by hiring Cobb to both play and manage   In 1922  Cobb tied a batting record set by Wee Willie Keeler  with four five hit games in a season  This has since been matched by Stan Musial  Tony Gwynn and Ichiro Suzuki  On May 10  1924  Cobb was honored at ceremonies before a game in Washington  D C   by more than 100 dignitaries and legislators  He received 21 books  one for each year of service in professional baseball   At the end of Cobb was once again embroiled in a batting title race  this time with one of his teammates and players  Harry Heilmann  In a doubleheader against the St  Louis Browns on October 4  1925  Heilmann got six hits to lead the Tigers to a sweep of the doubleheader and beat Cobb for the batting crown   393 to  389  Cobb and Brownie player manager George Sisler each pitched in the final game  Cobb pitching a perfect inning   2 6  Move to Philadelphia  Cobb announced his retirement after a 22 year career as a Tiger in November 1926  and headed home to Augusta  Georgia  Shortly thereafter  Tris Speaker also retired as player manager of the Cleveland Indians  The retirement of two great players at the same time sparked some interest  and it turned out that the two were coerced into retirement because of allegations of game fixing brought about by Dutch Leonard  a former pitcher managed by Cobb   Leonard accused former pitcher and outfielder Smoky Joe Wood and Cobb of betting on a Tiger Indian game played in Detroit on September 25  1919  in which they allegedly orchestrated a Tiger victory to win the bet  Leonard claimed proof existed in letters written to him by Cobb and Wood  Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis held a secret hearing with Cobb  Speaker and Wood  A second secret meeting among the AL directors led to the unpublicized resignations of Cobb and Speaker  however  rumors of the scandal led Judge Landis to hold additional hearings in which Leonard subsequently refused to participate  Cobb and Wood admitted to writing the letters  but claimed that a horse racing bet was involved and that Leonard s accusations were in retaliation for Cobb s having released him from the Tigers  thereby demoting him to the minor leagues  Speaker denied any wrongdoing   On January 27  1927  Judge Landis cleared Cobb and Speaker of any wrongdoing because of Leonard s refusal to appear at the hearings  Landis allowed both Cobb and Speaker to return to their original teams  but each team let them know that they were free agents and could sign with any club they wanted  Speaker signed with the Washington Senators for 1927  and Cobb with the Philadelphia Athletics  Speaker then joined Cobb in Philadelphia for the 1928 season  Cobb said he had come back only to seek vindication and say he left baseball on his own terms   Cobb played regularly in 1927 for a young and talented team that finished second to one of the greatest teams of all time  the 110–44 1927 Yankees  returning to Detroit to a tumultuous welcome on May 11 and doubling his time up to the cheers of Tiger fans  On July 18  Cobb became the first member of the 4000 hit club when he doubled off former teammate Sam Gibson  still pitching for the Tigers  at Navin Field   1927 was also the final season of Washington Senators pitcher Walter Johnson s career  With their careers largely overlapping  Cobb faced Johnson more times than any other batter pitcher matchup in baseball history  Cobb also got the first hit ever allowed by Johnson  After Johnson hit Detroit s Ossie Vitt with a pitch in August 1915  seriously injuring him  Cobb realized that Johnson was fearful of hitting opponents  He used this knowledge to his advantage by standing closer to the plate   Cobb returned for the 1928 season  but played less frequently due to his age and the blossoming abilities of the young A s  who were again in a pennant race with the Yankees  On September 3  Ty Cobb pinch hit in the ninth inning of the first game of a doubleheader against the Senators and doubled off Bump Hadley for his last career hit although his last at bat wasn t until September 11 against the Yankees  popping out off Hank Johnson and grounding out to shortstop Mark Koenig  He then announced his retirement  effective the end of the season   after batting  300 or higher in 23 consecutive seasons  the only season under  300 being his rookie season   a major league record not likely to be broken   He also ended his career with a rather dubious record  When Cobb retired  he led AL outfielders for most errors all time with 271  which still stands today  Nineteenth century player Tom Brown holds the major league record with 490 errors committed as an outfielder  while the National League record is held by nineteenth century player George Gore with 346 errors  Cobb ranks 14th on the all time list for errors committed by an outfielder   3  Post professional career  Cobb retired a very rich and successful man  He toured Europe with his family  went to Scotland for some time and then returned to his farm in Georgia  He spent his retirement pursuing his off season avocations of hunting  golfing  polo and fishing  His other pastime was trading stocks and bonds  increasing his immense personal wealth  He was a major stockholder in the Coca Cola Corporation  which by itself would have made him wealthy   In the winter of 1930  Cobb moved into a Spanish ranch estate on Spencer Lane in the millionaires  community of Atherton outside San Francisco  California  At the same time  his wife Charlie filed the first of several divorce suits  but withdrew the suit shortly thereafter  The couple eventually divorced in 1947 after 39 years of marriage  the last few of years of which Mrs  Cobb lived in nearby Menlo Park  The couple had three sons and two daughters  Tyrus Raymond Jr  Shirley Marion  Herschel Roswell  James Howell and Beverly   Cobb never had an easy time as husband and father  His children found him to be demanding  yet also capable of kindness and extreme warmth  He expected his sons to be exceptional athletes in general and baseball players in particular  Tyrus Raymond  Jr  flunked out of Princeton  where he had played on the varsity tennis team   much to his father s dismay  The elder Cobb subsequently traveled to the Princeton campus and beat his son with a whip to ensure against future academic failure  Tyrus Raymond  Jr  then entered Yale University and became captain of the tennis team while improving his academics  but was then arrested twice in 1930 for drunkenness and left Yale without graduating  Cobb helped his son deal with his pending legal problems  but then permanently broke off with him  Even though Tyrus Raymond  Jr  finally reformed and eventually earned an M D  from the Medical College of South Carolina and practiced obstetrics and gynecology in Dublin  Georgia until his premature death at 42 on September 9  1952 from a brain tumor  his father remained distant   In February 1936  when the first Hall of Fame election results were announced  Cobb had been named on 222 of 226 ballots  outdistancing Babe Ruth  Honus Wagner  Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson  the only others to earn the necessary 75% of votes to be elected that first year  His 98 2 percentage stood as the record until Tom Seaver received 98 8% of the vote in 1992  Those incredible results show that although many people disliked him personally  they respected the way he had played and what he had accomplished  In 1998  The Sporting News ranked him as third on the list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players   By the time he was elected to the Hall of Fame  Cobb had become a heavy smoker and drinker  and spent a great deal of time complaining about modern day players  lack of fundamental skills  He had positive things to say about Stan Musial  Phil Rizzuto and Jackie Robinson  but few others  Even so  he was known to help out young players  He was instrumental in helping Joe DiMaggio negotiate his rookie contract with the New York Yankees   Cobb s competitive fires continued to burn after retirement  In 1941  he faced Babe Ruth in a series of charity golf matches at courses outside New York  Boston and Detroit and won two out of three  At the 1947 Old Timers  Game in Yankee Stadium  he warned catcher Benny Bengough to move back  claiming he was rusty and hadn t swung a bat in almost 20 years  Bengough accordingly stepped back to avoid being struck by Cobb s backswing  Having repositioned the catcher  Cobb cannily laid down a perfect bunt in front of the plate and easily beat the throw from a surprised Bengough   Another bittersweet moment in Cobb s life reportedly came in the late 1940s  when he and sportswriter Grantland Rice were returning from the Masters golf tournament  Stopping at a Greenville  South Carolina liquor store  Cobb noticed that the man behind the counter was none other than  Shoeless  Joe Jackson  who had been banned from baseball almost 30 years earlier following the Black Sox scandal  But Jackson did not appear to recognize him  and after making his purchase an incredulous Cobb asked   Don t you know me  Joe    Sure I know you  Ty   replied Jackson   but I wasn t sure you wanted to know me  A lot of them don t    Cobb was mentioned in the poem  Line Up for Yesterday  by Ogden Nash   3 1  Later life  At 62  Cobb married a second time in 1949  His new wife was 40 year old Frances Fairbairn Cass  a divorcee from Buffalo  New York  Their childless marriage also failed  ending with a divorce in 1956  At this time  Cobb became generous with his wealth  donating $100 000 in his parents  name for his hometown to build a modern 24 bed hospital  Cobb Memorial Hospital  which is now part of the Ty Cobb Healthcare System  He also established the Cobb Educational Fund  which awarded scholarships to needy Georgia students bound for college  by endowing it with a $100 000 donation in 1953  equivalent to approximately $ in current year dollars     He knew that another way he could share his wealth was by having biographies written that would both set the record straight on him and teach young players how to play  John McCallum spent some time with Cobb to write a combination how to and biography titled The Tiger Wore Spikes  An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb that was published in 1956  In December 1959  he was diagnosed with prostate cancer  diabetes  high blood pressure  and Bright s disease  He did not trust his initial diagnosis and went to Georgia to seek a second opinion who confirmed that his prostate was indeed cancerous  They removed it at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta  but it did not check the spread of the disease   It was also during his final years that Cobb began work on his autobiography  My Life in Baseball  The True Record  with writer Al Stump  Later Stump would claim the collaboration was contentious and after Cobb s death Stump published two more books and a short story giving what he claimed was the  true story   One of these later books was used as the basis for the 1994 film Cobb  a box office flop  starring Tommy Lee Jones as Cobb and directed by Ron Shelton   In 2010  an article by William R   Ron  Cobb  no relation to Ty  in the peer reviewed The National Pastime  the official publication of the Society for American Baseball Research  accused Stump of extensive forgeries of Cobb related documents and diaries  The article further accused Stump of numerous false statements about Cobb in his last years  most of which were sensationalistic in nature and intended to cast Cobb in an unflattering light   3 2  Death  In his last days  Cobb spent some time with the old movie comedian Joe E  Brown  talking about the choices he had made in his life  He told Brown that he felt that he had made mistakes  and that he would do things differently if he could  He had played hard and lived hard all his life  had no friends to show for it at the end  and regretted it  Publicly  however  he claimed to have no regrets   I ve been lucky  I have no right to be regretful of what I did    He checked into Emory Hospital for the last time in June 1961  bringing with him a paper bag with over $1 million in negotiable bonds and a Colt  45 caliber pistol  His first wife  Charlie  his son Jimmy and other family members came to be with him for his final days  He died a month later  on July 17  1961  at Emory University Hospital   Approximately 150 friends and relatives attended a brief service in Cornelia  Georgia  and drove to the Cobb family mausoleum in Royston for the burial  Baseball s only representatives at his funeral were three old time players  Ray Schalk  Mickey Cochrane and Nap Rucker  along with Sid Keener  the director of the Baseball Hall of Fame  but messages of condolences numbered in the hundreds  Family in attendance included Cobb s former wife Charlie  his two daughters  his surviving son Jimmy  his two sons in law  his daughter in law Mary Dunn Cobb and her two children   At the time of his death  Cobb s estate was reported to be worth at least $11 780 million  equivalent to $ today   including $10 million worth of General Motors stock and $1 78 million in The Coca Cola Company stock  His will left a quarter of his estate to the Cobb Educational Fund  and distributed the rest among his children and grandchildren  Cobb is interred in the Rose Hill Cemetery in Royston  Georgia  As of July 2014  the Ty Cobb Educational Foundation has distributed $15 2 million in college scholarships to needy Georgians   3 3  Legacy  He is regarded by some historians and journalists as the best player of the dead ball era  and is generally seen as one of the greatest players of all time   Efforts to create a Ty Cobb Memorial in Royston initially failed  primarily because most of the artifacts from his life were sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown  New York and the Georgia town was viewed as too remote to make a memorial worthwhile  But ultimately  on July 17  1998  the 37th anniversary of Cobb s death  the Ty Cobb Museum and the Franklin County Sports Hall of Fame opened its doors in Royston  On that day  Cobb was one of the first members to be inducted into the Franklin County Sports Hall of Fame   On August 30  2005  his hometown hosted a 1905 baseball game to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Cobb s first major league game  Players in the game included many of Cobb s descendants as well as many citizens from his hometown of Royston  Another early 20th century baseball game was played in his hometown at Cobb Field on September 30  2006  with Cobb s descendants and Roystonians again playing  Cobb s personal batboy from his major league years was also in attendance  and threw out the first pitch   In addition to the aforementioned film  Ty Cobb s legacy also includes legions of collectors of his early tobacco card issues  as well as game used memorabilia and autographs  Perhaps the most curious item is a 1909 Ty Cobb Cigarettes pack  leaving some to believe Cobb either had  or attempted to have  his own brand of cigarettes  Very little about the card is known other than its similarity to the 1909 T206 Red Portrait card published by the American Tobacco Company  and until 2005 only a handful were known to exist  That year  a sizable cache of the cards was brought to auction by the family of a Royston  Georgia man who had stored them in a book for almost 100 years   The new baseball stadium at Hampden Sydney College is named Ty Cobb Ballpark   4  Rivalry with Sam Crawford  Sam Crawford and Ty Cobb were teammates for parts of thirteen seasons  They played beside each other in right and center field  and Crawford followed Cobb in the batting order year after year  Despite the physical closeness  the two had a complicated relationship   Initially  they had a student teacher relationship  Crawford was an established star when Cobb arrived  and Cobb eagerly sought his advice  In interviews with Al Stump  Cobb told of studying Crawford s base stealing technique and of how Crawford would teach him about pursuing fly balls and throwing out base runners  Cobb told Stump he would always remember Crawford s kindness   The student teacher relationship gradually changed to one of jealous rivals  Cobb was not popular with his teammates  and as Cobb became the biggest star in baseball  Crawford was unhappy with the preferential treatment given to Cobb  Cobb was allowed to show up late for spring training and was given private quarters on the road – perks not offered to Crawford  The competition between the two was intense  Crawford recalled that  if he went three for four on a day when Cobb went hitless  Cobb would turn red and sometimes walk out of the park with the game still on  When it was reported that Nap Lajoie had won the batting title  Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb   In retirement  Cobb wrote a letter to a writer for The Sporting News accusing Crawford of not helping in the outfield and of intentionally fouling off balls when Cobb was stealing a base  Crawford learned about the letter in 1946 and accused Cobb of being a  cheapskate  who never helped his teammates  He said that Cobb had not been a very good fielder   so he blamed me   Crawford denied intentionally trying to deprive Cobb of stolen bases  insisting that Cobb had  dreamed that up    When asked about the feud  Cobb attributed it to jealousy  He felt that Crawford was  a hell of a good player   but he was  second best  on the Tigers and  hated to be an also ran   Cobb biographer Richard Bak noted that the two  only barely tolerated each other  and agreed with Cobb that Crawford’s attitude was driven by Cobb’s having stolen Crawford s thunder   Although they may not have spoken to each other  Cobb and Crawford developed an uncanny ability to communicate non verbally with looks and nods on the base paths  They became one of the most successful double steal pairings in baseball history   After Cobb died  a reporter found hundreds of letters in Cobb s home that Cobb had written to influential people lobbying for Crawford s induction into the Hall of Fame  Crawford was reportedly unaware of Cobb s efforts until after Cobb had died  Crawford was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1957  four years before Cobb s death   5  Reputed violence and bigotry  As Smithsonian magazine has stated   Violent confrontations were a recurring theme in Cobb’s life   and  stories of Cobb’s racial intolerance were well documented   In recent decades these facts have tarnished his reputation  However  the reputation of Cobb as an extremely violent man was fanned by sportswriter Al Stump  his first biographer  whose veracity has been called into question  Stump greatly exaggerated or outright lied about the violence Cobb had committed   While Cobb was often  painted a racist  during his baseball career  and engaged in a number of well documented fights with African Americans  Cobb s views changed after his retirement from baseball  In 1952  five years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier  he publicly supported blacks and whites playing baseball together  adding   Certainly it is okay for them to play  I see no reason in the world why we shouldn t compete with colored athletes as long as they conduct themselves with politeness and gentility  Let me say also that no white man has the right to be less of a gentleman than a colored man  in my book that goes not only for baseball but in all walks of life   Nevertheless  it should be noted that by 1952  when Cobb made that statement  over 150 African American baseball players were already playing in fully integrated teams  But despite his past reputation  black newspapers came to accept that Cobb had changed in his later years  In 1953  they cited his praise for Brooklyn Dodgers  catcher Roy Campanella  who Cobb said was  among the all time best catchers  in baseball  And in the obituaries that ran in the black press  Cobb was praised for   speaking  in favor of racial freedom in baseball    6  Regular season statistics  Both official sources  such as Total Baseball  and a number of independent researchers  including John Thorn  have raised questions about Cobb s exact career totals  Hits have been re estimated at between 4 189 and 4 191  due to a possible double counted game in 1910  At bats estimates have ranged as high as 11 437  The numbers shown below are the figures officially recognized on MLB com   The figures on Baseball Reference com are as follows  Other private research sites may have different figures  Caught Stealing is not shown comprehensively for Cobb s MLB com totals  because the stat was not regularly recorded until 1920   7  See also  Allan Travers  Cobb  film   3000 hit club  List of Major League Baseball stolen base records  List of Major League Baseball hit records  List of Major
