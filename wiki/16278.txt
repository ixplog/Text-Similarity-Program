pseudoscience  Randi is the co founder of Committee for Skeptical Inquiry  CSI   and the founder of the James Randi Educational Foundation  JREF   He began his career as a magician named The Amazing Randi  but after retiring at age 60  he chose to devote most of his time to investigating paranormal  occult  and supernatural claims  which he collectively calls  woo woo    Although often referred to as a  debunker   Randi dislikes the term s connotations and prefers to describe himself as an  investigator   He has written about the paranormal  skepticism  and the history of magic  He was a frequent guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and was occasionally featured on the television program Penn & Teller  Bullshit  The JREF sponsors the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge offering a prize of US$1 000 000 to eligible applicants who can demonstrate evidence of any paranormal  supernatural or occult power or event under test conditions agreed to by both parties   1  Early life  Randi was born on August 7  1928 in Toronto  Ontario  Canada  the son of Marie Alice  née Paradis  and George Randall Zwinge  He has a younger brother and sister  He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone  Sr  and reading conjuring books while spending 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident  He confounded doctors who expected he would never walk again  Randi often skipped classes  and  at 17  dropped out of high school to perform as a conjurer in a carnival roadshow  He practiced as a mentalist in local nightclubs and at Toronto s Canadian National Exhibition  and wrote for Montreal s tabloid press  In his twenties  Randi posed as a psychic to establish that they were actually doing simple tricks  and briefly wrote an astrological column in the Canadian tabloid Midnight under the name  Zo ran   by simply shuffling up items from newspaper astrology columns and pasting them randomly into a column  In his thirties  Randi worked in the UK  Europe  and Philippine nightclubs and all across Japan  He witnessed many tricks that were presented as being supernatural  One of his earliest reported experiences is that of seeing an evangelist using a version of the  one ahead  technique to convince churchgoers of his divine powers   2  Career  2 1  Magician  Though defining himself as a conjuror  Randi s career as a professional stage magician and escapologist began in 1946  Initially  he presented himself under his real name  Randall Zwinge  which he later dropped in favor of  The Amazing Randi   Early in his career  he performed numerous escape acts from jail cells and safes around the world  On February 7  1956  he appeared live on NBC s Today show  where he remained for 104 minutes in a sealed metal coffin that had been submerged in a hotel swimming pool  breaking what was said to be Harry Houdini s record of 93 minutes   In the late 1960s  Randi hosted The Amazing Randi Show on New York radio station WOR  This radio show  which filled Long John Nebel s old slot with similar content after Nebel went to WNBC in 1962  often invited guests who defended paranormal claims  among them Randi s then friend James W  Moseley  Randi  in turn  spoke at Moseley s 1967 Fourth Congress of Scientific Ufologists in New York City  stating   Let s not fool ourselves  There are some garden variety liars involved in all this  But in among all the trash and nonsense perpetrated in the name of Ufology  I think there is a small grain of truth    Randi also hosted numerous television specials and went on several world tours  As  The Amazing Randi  he appeared regularly on the New York based children s television series Wonderama from 1959 to 1967  He also auditioned for a revival of the 1950s children s show The Magic Clown in 1970  which showed briefly in Detroit   and in Kenya  In the February 2  1974  issue of the British conjuring magazine Abracadabra  Randi  defining the community of magicians  stated   I know of no calling which depends so much upon mutual trust and faith as does ours   In the December 2003 issue of The Linking Ring  the monthly publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians  it is stated   Perhaps Randi s ethics are what make him Amazing  and  The Amazing Randi not only talks the talk  he walks the walk    During Alice Cooper s 1973–1974 Billion Dollar Babies tour  Randi performed on stage both as a mad dentist and as Alice s executioner  He also designed and built several of the stage props  including the guillotine  Shortly after that  in a 1976 performance for the Canadian TV special World of Wizards  Randi escaped from a straitjacket while suspended upside down over Niagara Falls   Randi has been accused of actually using  psychic powers  to perform acts such as spoon bending  According to James Alcock  at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller  a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud  Randi said   Yes  indeed  I m a trickster  I m a cheat  I m a charlatan  that s what I do for a living  Everything I ve done here was by trickery   The professor shouted back   That s not what I mean  You re a fraud because you re pretending to do these things through trickery  but you re actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it   A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell  a believer in psychic phenomena  When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator by using simple trickery  Pell refused to believe that it was a trick  saying   I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn t realize it   Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities   2 2  Author  Randi is author of ten books  among them Conjuring  1992   a biographical history of noted magicians  The book is subtitled  Being a Definitive History of the Venerable Arts of Sorcery  Prestidigitation  Wizardry  Deception  & Chicanery and of the Mountebanks & Scoundrels Who have Perpetrated these Subterfuges on a Bewildered Public  in short  MAGIC  The book s cover says that it is by  James Randi  Esq   A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed   The book selects the most influential magicians and tells some of their history  often in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road  This work expanded on Randi s second book which was titled Houdini  His Life and Art  This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co authored with Bert Sugar  It focuses on the professional and private life of Houdini   Randi also wrote a children s book in 1989 titled The Magic World of the Amazing Randi  which introduced children to magic tricks  In addition to his magic books  he has written several educational works about the paranormal and pseudoscientific  These include biographies of Uri Geller and Nostradamus as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures  He is currently working on A Magician in the Laboratory  which recounts his application of skepticism to science  He was a member of the all male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders  which served as the basis of his good friend Isaac Asimov s fictional group of mystery solvers  the Black Widowers   Other books are Flim Flam   1982   The Faith Healers  1987   James Randi  Psychic Investigator  1991   and An Encyclopedia of Claims  Frauds  and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural  1995    2 3  Skeptic  Randi entered the international spotlight in 1972 when he publicly challenged the claims of Uri Geller  He accused Geller of being nothing more than a charlatan and a fraud who used standard magic tricks to accomplish his allegedly paranormal feats  and he presented his claims in the book The Truth About Uri Geller  1982    In 1976  Randi  Martin Gardner and Ray Hyman founded the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal  CSICOP   using donations and sales of their magazine  Skeptical Inquirer  They and secular humanist philosopher Paul Kurtz took seats on the executive board  with Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan joining as founding members  Randi traveled the world on behalf of CSICOP  becoming its public face  and according to Ray Hyman  the face of the skeptical movement   Geller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15 million in 1991 and lost  Geller s suit against the CSICOP was thrown out in 1995  and he was ordered to pay $120 000 for filing a frivolous lawsuit  The legal costs Randi incurred ate through almost all of a $272 000 MacArthur Foundation grant awarded to Randi in 1986 for his work  Randi also dismissed Uri Geller s claims that he was capable of the kind of psychic photography made famous by the case of Ted Serios  It is a matter  Randi argues  of trick photography using a simple hand held optical device  During the period of Geller s legal dispute  CSICOP s leadership  wanting to avoid becoming a target of Geller s litigation  demanded that Randi refrain from commenting on Geller  Randi refused and resigned  though he maintained a respectful relationship with the group  which in 2006 changed its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry  In 2010  Randi was one of 16 new CSI fellows elected by its board   Randi has gone on to write many articles criticizing beliefs and claims regarding the paranormal  He has also demonstrated flaws in studies suggesting the existence of paranormal phenomena  in his Project Alpha hoax  Randi successfully planted two fake psychics in a privately funded psychic research experiment  The hoax became a scandal and demonstrated the shortcomings of many paranormal research projects at the university level   Randi has appeared on numerous TV shows  sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests  In a 1981 appearance on That s My Line  Randi appeared opposite claimed psychic James Hydrick  who said that he could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it  Randi  having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book  arranged foam packaging peanuts on the table in front of the telephone book for the demonstration  This prevented Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities  which would have been exposed when the blowing moved the packaging  Randi writes that  eventually  Hydrick  confessed everything    Randi was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1986  The fellowship s 5 year grant helped support Randi s investigations of faith healers  including W  V  Grant  Ernest Angley  and Peter Popoff  whom Randi first exposed on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in February 1986  Hearing about his investigation of Popoff  Carson invited Randi onto his late night TV show without seeing the evidence he was going to reveal  Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff s broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience  revealing personal information about her that he claims comes from God  and then performing a laying on of hands healing to drive the devil from her body  Randi then replayed the video  but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder  Their scanner detected the radio frequency Popoff s wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff s left ear  The information had been gathered by Popoff s assistants  who handed out  prayer cards  to the audience before the show  instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them   The news coverage generated by Randi s exposé on The Tonight Show led to many TV stations dropping Popoff s TV show  eventually forcing him into bankruptcy in September 1987  However  the televangelist returned to the airwaves soon after with faith healing infomercials that reportedly pulled in more than $23 million in 2005  from viewers sending in money for promised healing and prosperity  The Canadian Centre for Inquiry s Think Again  TV documented one of Popoff s more recent performances before a large audience who gathered in Toronto on May 26  2011  hoping to be saved from illness and poverty   In February 1988  Randi tested the gullibility of the media by perpetrating a hoax of his own  By teaming up with Australia s 60 Minutes program and by releasing a fake press package  he built up publicity for a spirit channeler named Carlos who was actually artist Jose Alvarez  whom Randi described as a  friend   Randi would tell him what to say through sophisticated radio equipment  According to the 60 Minutes program on the Carlos hoax   it was claimed that Alvarez would not have had the audience he did at the Opera House  and the potential sales therefrom  had the media coverage been more aggressive  and factual    though an analysis by The Skeptic s Tim Mendham concluded that while the media coverage of Alvarez s appearances was not credulous   it  the hoax  at least showed that they could benefit by being a touch more sceptical   The hoax was exposed on 60 Minutes Australia   Carlos  and Randi explained how they had pulled it off   In his book The Faith Healers  Randi wrote that his anger and relentlessness arises out of compassion for the victims of fraud  Randi has also been critical of João de Deus  John of God   a self proclaimed psychic surgeon who has received international attention  Randi observed  referring to psychic surgery   To any experienced conjurer  the methods by which these seeming miracles are produced are very obvious    In 1982  Randi verified the abilities of Arthur Lintgen  a Philadelphia physician who is able to determine the classical music recorded on a vinyl LP solely by examining the grooves on the record  However  Lintgen did not claim to have any paranormal ability  merely knowledge of the way that the groove forms patterns on particular recordings   In 1988 John Maddox  editor of the prominent UK science journal Nature asked Randi to join the supervision of the homeopathy experiment conducted by Jacques Benveniste s team  Once Randi s stricter protocol concerning the experiment was in place  the results could not be reproduced anymore   James Randi stated that Daniel Dunglas Home  who could allegedly play an accordion that was locked in a cage without touching it  was caught cheating on a few occasions  but the incidents were never made public  He also stated that the actual instrument in use was a one octave mouth organ concealed under Home s large moustache and that other one octave mouth organs were found in Home s belongings after his death  According to Randi  William Lindsay Gresham told Randi  around 1960  that he had seen these mouth organs in the Home collection at the Society for Psychical Research  SPR   Eric Dingwall  who catalogued Home s collection on its arrival at the SPR does not record the presence of the mouth organs  According to Peter Lamont  the author of an extensive Home biography   It is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or did not make them public    Randi distinguishes between pseudoscience and crackpot science  He regards most of parapsychology as pseudoscience because of the way in which it is approached  but nonetheless sees it as a legitimate science which  must be pursued   and from which real scientific discoveries may develop  Randi regards crackpot science as being as  equally wrong  as pseudoscience  but with no scientific pretensions   2 4  Exploring Psychic Powers    Live television show  Exploring Psychic Powers    Live was a television show aired live on June 7  1989  wherein Randi examined several people claiming psychic powers  The show offered $100 000  Randi s then $10 000 prize plus $90 000 put up by the show s syndicator  LBS Communications  Inc   to anyone who could demonstrate genuine psychic powers   An astrologer claimed that he was able to ascertain a person s astrological sign after talking with them for a few minutes  He was presented with twelve people  one at a time  each with a different astrological sign  The people could not tell the astrologer their astrological sign or birth date  nor could they wear anything that would indicate it  After the astrologer talked to the people  he had them sit in front of a sign that the astrologer thought was theirs  By agreement  the astrologer needed to get ten of the 12 correct  to win  He got none correct   The next psychic claimed to be able to read auras around people  The psychic claimed that auras were visible at least five inches from the people  The psychic chose ten people who he said had clearly visible auras  These people were to stand behind screens and the psychic agreed that the aura would be visible above the screens  The screens were numbered 1 through 10  and people were selected whether or not to stand behind their screen at random  The psychic was to tell whether or not a person was standing behind each screen  by seeing the aura above  Since random guessing would be expected to get about five correct  the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right  The psychic stated that she saw an aura over all ten screens  but people were behind only four of the screens   A dowser claimed that he could locate water  even in a bottle inside a sealed cardboard box  He was shown twenty boxes and he was to indicate which boxes contained a water bottle  He indicated that eight of the boxes contained water  but only five did   A psychometric psychic claimed to be able to receive personal information about the owner of an object from the object  In order to avoid ambiguous statements  the psychic agreed to be presented with a watch and a key from twelve different people  The psychic was to match keys and watches to each owner  According to the prior agreement  the psychic had to match nine out of the twelve sets  but she succeeded in only two of the cases   During the program  another psychic was doing a run of 250 Zener cards  guessing which of the five symbols was on each one  Random guessing should result in about fifty correct predictions  so it was agreed in advance that the psychic had to be right on at least eighty two cards in order to demonstrate an ability greater than chance  However  she was able to get only fifty predictions correct  which is no better than random guessing   2 5  James Randi Educational Foundation  JREF   In 1996  Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation  Randi and his colleagues update JREF s blog  Swift  Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the one seventh area triangle  Randi also contributes a regular column  titled   Twas Brillig   to The Skeptics Society s Skeptic magazine  In his weekly commentary  Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day   2 6  2010s  Randi has been regularly featured on many podcasts  including The Skeptics Society s official podcast Skepticality and the Center for Inquiry s official podcast Point of Inquiry  From September 2006 onwards  he has occasionally contributed to The Skeptics  Guide to the Universe podcast with a column titled  Randi Speaks   In addition  The Amazing Show is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format   In 2014 Part2Filmworks released An Honest Liar  a feature film documentary  written by Tyler Measom and Greg O Toole  and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein  The film  which was funded through Kickstarter  focuses on Randi s life  his investigations  and his relationship with longtime partner José Alvarez  The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival  at Toronto s Hot Docs film festival  and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring  Maryland and Washington  D C   where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature  It was also positively received by critics   3  Views on religion  Randi s parents were members of the Anglican Church  but rarely attended services  He went to Sunday School a few times as a child  but decided to stop going when he was told not to question or doubt the teachings of the church   In his essay  Why I Deny Religion  How Silly and Fantastic It Is  and Why I m a Dedicated and Vociferous Bright   Randi  who identifies himself as an atheist  has stated that many accounts in religious texts  including the virgin birth  the miracles of Jesus Christ  and the parting of the Red Sea by Moses  are not believable  For example  Randi refers to the Virgin Mary as being  impregnated by a ghost of some sort  and as a result produced a son who could walk on water  raise the dead  turn water into wine  and multiply loaves of bread and fishes  and questions how Adam and Eve  could have two sons  one of whom killed the other  and yet managed to populate the earth without committing incest   He writes that  compared to the Bible   The Wizard of Oz is more believable  And more fun    In An Encyclopedia of Claims  Frauds  and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural  1995   he looks at a variety of spiritual practices skeptically  Of the meditation techniques of Guru Maharaj Ji he writes   Only the very naive were convinced that they had been let in on some sort of celestial secret   In 2003  he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto   4  One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge  The James Randi Educational Foundation  JREF  offers a prize of US$1 000 000 to eligible applicants who are able to demonstrate a supernatural ability under scientific testing criteria agreed to by both sides  Based on the paranormal challenges of John Nevil Maskelyne and Houdini  the foundation began in 1964  when Randi put up $1 000 of his own money payable to anyone who could provide objective proof of the paranormal  The prize money has since grown to $1 000 000  and has formal published rules  For example  no one has progressed past the preliminary test  which is set up with parameters agreed to by both Randi and the applicant  He also refuses to accept any challengers who might suffer serious injury or death as a result of the testing  On April 1  2007  it was ruled that only persons with an established  nationally recognized media profile and the backing of a reputable academic were allowed to apply for the challenge  in order to avoid wasting JREF resources on spurious claimants  This requirement has since been revoked due to heavy objections from would be applicants   On Larry King Live  March 6  2001  Larry King asked Sylvia Browne if she would take the challenge and she agreed  Randi appeared with Browne on Larry King Live six months later  and she again appeared to accept his challenge  However  according to Randi  she ultimately refused to be tested  and the Randi Foundation kept a clock on its website recording the number of weeks since Browne allegedly accepted the challenge without following through  until Browne s death in November 2013   During another appearance on Larry King Live on June 5  2001  Randi challenged Rosemary Altea to undergo testing for the million dollars  but Altea refused to address the question  Instead Altea replied only   I agree with what he says  that there are many  many people who claim to be spiritual mediums  they claim to talk to the dead  There are many people  we all know this  There are cheats and charlatans everywhere   On January 26  2007  Altea and Randi again appeared on the show  and Altea again refused to answer whether or not she would take the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge   In October 2007  claimed psychic John Edward appeared on Headline Prime  hosted by Glenn Beck  when asked if he would take Randi s challenge  Edward responded   It s funny  I was on Larry King Live once  and they asked me the same question  And I made a joke  then   and I ll say the same thing here  Why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who s got an adjective as a first name   Beck simply laughed and changed the subject   Randi asked British businessman Jim McCormick  the inventor of the bogus ADE 651 bomb detector  to take the challenge in October 2008  Randi called the ADE 651  a useless quack device which cannot perform any other function than separating naive persons from their money  It s a fake  a scam  a swindle  and a blatant fraud  Prove me wrong and take the million dollars   There was no response from McCormick  According to Iraqi investigators  the ADE 651  which was corruptly sold to the Baghdad bomb squad  was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilians who died as a result of terrorist bombs which were not detected at checkpoints  On April 23  2013  McCormick was convicted of three counts of fraud at the Old Bailey in London  and was subsequently sentenced to ten years imprisonment for his part in the ADE 651 scandal   JREF maintains a public log of past participants in the Million Dollar Challenge   5  Legal disputes  Randi has been involved in a variety of legal disputes but says that he has  never paid even one dollar or even one cent to anyone who ever sued me   However  he says  he has paid out large sums to personally defend himself in these suits   5 1  Uri Geller  According to Randi  Geller tried to sue Randi a number of times  accusing him of libel  Geller never won  save for a ruling in a Japanese court that ordered Randi to pay Geller one third of one percent of what Geller had demanded  but this ruling was canceled  and the matter dropped  when Geller decided to concentrate on another legal matter  In 1991  Randi commented that Uri Geller s public performances were of the same quality as those found on the backs of cereal boxes  Geller sued both Randi and CSICOP  CSICOP argued that the organization was not responsible for Randi s statements  The court agreed that including CSICOP was frivolous and dropped them from the action  leaving Randi to face the action alone  Geller was ordered to pay substantial damages to CSICOP  Randi and Geller subsequently settled their dispute out of court  the details of which have been kept confidential  The settlement also included an agreement that Geller would not pursue Randi for the award in the Japanese case or other outstanding cases   5 2  Other cases  In 1996  Baltimore District Court found Randi liable for defaming Eldon Byrd for calling him a child molester in a magazine story and a  shopping market molester  in a 1988 speech  However  the jury found that Byrd was not entitled to any monetary damages after hearing testimony that he had sexually molested and later married his sister in law  The jury also cleared the other defendant in the case  CSICOP   Late in 1996  Randi launched a libel suit against a Toronto area psychic named Earl Gordon Curley  Curley had made multiple objectionable comments about Randi on Usenet  Despite suggesting to Randi on Usenet that Randi should sue – Curley s comments implying that if Randi did not sue  then his allegations must be true – Curley seemed entirely surprised when Randi actually retained Toronto s largest law firm and initiated legal proceedings  The suit was eventually dropped in 1998 when Earl Curley died at the age of 51 of  alcohol toxicity    Allison DuBois  on whose life the television series Medium was based  threatened Randi with legal action for using a photo of her from her website in his December 17  2004  commentary without her permission  Randi removed the photo and subsequently used a caricature of DuBois when mentioning her on his site  beginning with his December 23  2005  commentary   Sniffex  producer of a dowsing bomb detection device  sued Randi and the JREF in 2007 and lost  Sniffex sued Randi for his comments regarding a government test in which the Sniffex device failed  The company was later investigated and charged with fraud   In 2012  magician Penn Jillette announced that he was working on a biography of Randi   6  Personal life  When he hosted his own radio show in the 1960s  Randi lived in a small house in Rumson  New Jersey that featured a sign on the premises that read   Randi — charlatan   In 1986  Randi  who had recently relocated to Florida  met José Alvarez in a Fort Lauderdale public library  where Alvarez  then a 25 year old student at The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale  was looking for visual references for a ceramics project  struck up a conversation with Alvarez that lasted the entire afternoon  They moved in together soon afterward   In 1987  Randi became a naturalized citizen of the United States  Randi has said that one reason he became an American citizen was an incident while on tour with Alice Cooper where the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched the band s lockers during a performance  Nothing was found  yet the RCMP trashed the room   In February 2006  Randi underwent coronary artery bypass surgery  In early February 2006  he was declared to be in stable condition and  receiving excellent care  with his recovery proceeding well  The weekly commentary updates to his Web site were made by guests while he was hospitalized  Randi recovered after his surgery and was able to help organize and attend the 2007 Amaz ng Meeting in Las Vegas  Nevada  an annual convention of scientists  magicians  skeptics  atheists and freethinkers    Randi was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in June 2009  He had a ping pong ball sized tumor removed from his intestines during laparoscopic surgery  He announced the diagnosis a week later at The Amaz ng Meeting 7 as well as the fact that he was scheduled to begin chemotherapy in the following weeks  He also said at the conference   One day  I m gonna die  That s all there is to it  Hey  it s too bad  but I ve got to make room  I m using a lot of oxygen and such — I think it s good use of oxygen myself  but of course  I m a little prejudiced on the matter   Randi also said that after he is gone he does not want his fans to bother with a museum of magic named after him or burying him in a fancy tomb  Instead  he said   I want to be cremated  and I want my ashes blown in Uri Geller s eyes   Randi underwent his final chemotherapy session on December 31  2009  as he explained in a January 12  2010 video in which he related that his chemotherapy experience was not as unpleasant as he had imagined it might be  In a video posted April 12  2010  Randi stated that he has been given a clean bill of health   In a March 21  2010  blog entry  Randi came out as gay  a move he explained was inspired by seeing the 2008 biographical drama film Milk  in which Sean Penn portrayed Harvey Milk  the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California   On September 8  2011  United States Department of State agents arrested José Alvarez  who confessed that his real name was Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga  and that he came to the U S  on a two year student visa after fleeing persecution in Venezuela stemming from his homosexuality  After Alvarez began his relationship with Randi  his visa expired  and without any way to renew it  he acquired from a local friend the name and Social Security number of a man named José Alvarez  whom Alvarez believed was deceased  and used it to apply for a passport in 1987  He learned  however  that the real Alvarez was a teacher s aide living in The Bronx  Alvarez was charged with making a false statement in the application and use of a passport and aggravated identity theft  and faced a $250 000 fine  a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and deportation to Venezuela  After six weeks in jail  he was released on a $500 000 bond and he agreed to plead guilty to a single charge of passport fraud  At a sentencing hearing in May 2012  the judge sentenced him to time served  six months  house arrest and 150 hours  community service  Five days later  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Peña  After two months of incarceration  Peña was released August 2  2012  The couple were married in a ceremony in Washington on July 2  2013  Peña remains on probation and no longer holds any identity documents except a Venezuelan passport with his birth name  and holds no formal immigration status in the United States  While immigration authorities have agreed not to deport him  were he to leave the country  he would be unable to return  He continues to sign his paintings with  José Alvarez   but now followed by his true initials  D O P A  Randi and Peña live in Plantation  Florida   Randi has never smoked  taken narcotics or become inebriated  because  as he has explained   that can easily just fuzz the edges of my rationality  fuzz the edges of my reasoning powers and I want to be as aware as I possibly can  That may mean giving up a lot of fantasies that might be comforting in some ways  but I m willing to give that up in order to live in an actually real world    7  Awards
