Trick or treating is a customary practice for children on Halloween in many countries  Children in costumes travel from house to house in order to ask for treats such as candy  or  in some cultures  money  with the phrase  Trick or treat   The  trick  is a  usually idle  threat to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given to them  In North America  trick or treating has been a customary Halloween tradition since the late 1920s  It typically happens between 5 30pm and 9 30pm on October 31  although some municipalities choose other dates  Homeowners wishing to participate in it sometimes decorate their private entrances with artificial spider webs  plastic skeletons and jack o lanterns  Some rather reluctant homeowners would simply leave the candy in bowls on the porch  others might be more participative and would even ask an effort from the children in order to provide them with candy  In more recent years  however  the practice has spread to almost any house within a neighbourhood being visited by children  including senior residences and condominiums   The tradition of going from door to door receiving food already existed in Great Britain and Ireland in the form of  souling   where children and poor people would sing and say prayers for the dead in return for cakes  Guising—children disguised in costumes going from door to door for food and coins—also predates trick or treat  and is recorded in Scotland at Halloween in 1895  where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of scooped out turnips  visit homes to be rewarded with cakes  fruit and money  While going from door to door in disguise has remained popular among Scots and Irish  the custom of saying  trick or treat  has recently become common  The activity is prevalent in the United States  Canada  the United Kingdom  the Republic of Ireland  Puerto Rico  and northwestern and central Mexico  In the latter  this practice is called calaverita  Spanish for  little skull    and instead of  trick or treat   the children ask ¿me da mi calaverita    can you give me my little skull     where a calaverita is a small skull made of sugar or chocolate   1  History  1 1  Origin  The practice of dressing up in costumes and begging door to door for treats on holidays dates back to the Middle Ages and includes Christmas wassailing  Trick or treating resembles the late medieval Christian practice of souling  when poor folk would go door to door on Hallowmas  November 1   receiving food in return for prayers for the dead on All Souls Day  November 2   It originated in Ireland and Britain  although similar practices for the souls of the dead were found as far south as Italy  Shakespeare mentions the practice in his comedy The Two Gentlemen of Verona  1593   when Speed accuses his master of  puling  whimpering or whining  like a beggar at Hallowmas   The custom of wearing costumes and masks at Halloween goes back to Celtic traditions of attempting to copy the evil spirits or placate them  in Scotland for instance where the dead were impersonated by young men with masked  veiled or blackened faces  dressed in white   Guising at Halloween in Scotland is recorded in 1895  where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of scooped out turnips  visit homes to be rewarded with cakes  fruit and money  The practice of Guising at Halloween in North America is first recorded in 1911  where a newspaper in Kingston  Ontario reported children going  guising  around the neighborhood   American historian and author Ruth Edna Kelley of Massachusetts wrote the first book length history of the holiday in the US  The Book of Hallowe en  1919   and references souling in the chapter  Hallowe en in America    The taste in Hallowe en festivities now is to study old traditions  and hold a Scotch party  using Burn s poem Hallowe en as a guide  or to go a souling as the English used  In short  no custom that was once honored at Hallowe en is out of fashion now  Kelley lived in Lynn  Massachusetts  a town with 4 500 Irish immigrants  1 900 English immigrants  and 700 Scottish immigrants in 1920  In her book  Kelley touches on customs that arrived from across the Atlantic   Americans have fostered them  and are making this an occasion something like what it must have been in its best days overseas  All Hallowe en customs in the United States are borrowed directly or adapted from those of other countries    While the first reference to  guising  in North America occurs in 1911  another reference to ritual begging on Halloween appears  place unknown  in 1915  with a third reference in Chicago in 1920  The earliest known use in print of the term  trick or treat  appears in 1927  from Blackie  Alberta   Hallowe’en provided an opportunity for real strenuous fun  No real damage was done except to the temper of some who had to hunt for wagon wheels  gates  wagons  barrels  etc   much of which decorated the front street  The youthful tormentors were at back door and front demanding edible plunder by the word “trick or treat” to which the inmates gladly responded and sent the robbers away rejoicing  The thousands of Halloween postcards produced between the start of the 20th century and the 1920s commonly show children but do not depict trick or treating  The editor of a collection of over 3 000 vintage Halloween postcards writes   There are cards which mention the custom  of trick or treating  or show children in costumes at the doors  but as far as we can tell they were printed later than the 1920s and more than likely even the 1930s  Tricksters of various sorts are shown on the early postcards  but not the means of appeasing them    Trick or treating does not seem to have become a widespread practice until the 1930s  with the first U S  appearances of the term in 1934  and the first use in a national publication occurring in 1939   1 2  Increased popularity  Almost all pre 1940 uses of the term  trick or treat  are from the western United States and Canada  Trick or treating spread from the western United States eastward  stalled by sugar rationing that began in April 1942 during World War II and did not end until June 1947   Early national attention to trick or treating was given in October 1947 issues of the children s magazines Jack and Jill and Children s Activities  and by Halloween episodes of the network radio programs The Baby Snooks Show in 1946 and The Jack Benny Show and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet in 1948  Trick or treating was depicted in the Peanuts comic strip in 1951  The custom had become firmly established in popular culture by 1952  when Walt Disney portrayed it in the cartoon Trick or Treat  and Ozzie and Harriet were besieged by trick or treaters on an episode of their television show  In 1953 UNICEF first conducted a national campaign for children to raise funds for the charity while trick or treating   Although some popular histories of Halloween have characterized trick or treating as an adult invention to rechannel Halloween activities away from vandalism  there are very few records supporting it  Des Moines  Iowa is the only area known to have a record of trick or treating being used to deter crime  Elsewhere  adults  as reported in newspapers from the mid 1930s to the mid 1950s  typically saw it as a form of extortion  with reactions ranging from bemused indulgence to anger  Likewise  as portrayed on radio shows  children would have to explain what trick or treating was to puzzled adults  and not the other way around  Sometimes even the children protested  for Halloween 1948  members of the Madison Square Boys Club in New York City carried a parade banner that read  American Boys Don t Beg   The National Confectioners Association reported in 2005 that 80 percent of adults in the United States planned to give out confectionery to trick or treaters  and that 93 percent of children  teenagers  and young adults planned to go trick or treating or participating in other Halloween activities  In 2008  Halloween candy  costumes and other related products accounted for $5 77 billion in revenue   1 3  Phrase introduction to the UK and Ireland  Despite the concept of trick or treating originating in Ireland and Scotland in the form of guising  the use of the term  trick or treat  at the doors of home owners was not common until the 1980s  Guising is devoid of any jocular threat  and according to one BBC journalist  in the 1980s it was still often viewed as an exotic and not particularly welcome import  with the BBC referring to it as  the Japanese knotweed of festivals  and  making demands with menaces   In Ireland before the phrase  trick or treat  became common  children would say  Help the Halloween Party   Very often  the phrase  trick or treat  is simply said and the revellers are given sweets  with the choice of a trick or a treat having been discarded   2  Local variants  2 1  Guising  In Scotland and Ireland   guising  — children going from door to door in disguise — is traditional  and a gift in the form of food  coins or  apples or nuts for the Halloween party   in more recent times chocolate  is given out to the children dressed up in various costumes  The tradition is called  guising  because of the disguises or costumes worn by the children  In the West Mid Scots dialect  guising is known as  galoshans   Among the earliest record of guising at Halloween in Scotland is in 1895  where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of scooped out turnips  visit homes to be rewarded with cakes  fruit and money  Guising also involved going to wealthy homes  and in the 1920s  boys went guising at Halloween up to the affluent Thorntonhall  South Lanarkshire  An account of guising in the 1950s in Ardrossan  North Ayrshire  records a child receiving 12 shillings and sixpence having knocked on doors throughout the neighborhood and performed  There is a significant difference from the way the practice has developed in North America with the jocular threat  In Scotland and Ireland  the children are only supposed to receive treats if they perform a party trick for the households they go to  This normally takes the form of singing a song or reciting a joke or a funny poem which the child has memorized before setting out  Occasionally a more talented child may do card tricks  play the mouth organ  or something even more impressive  but most children will earn plenty of treats even with something very simple  Often they won t even need to perform  While going from door to door in disguise has remained popular among Scots and Irish at Halloween  the North American saying  trick or treat  has become common   2 2  Trunk or Treat  Some organizations around the US sponsor a  Trunk or Treat  on Halloween night  or on occasion  a day immediately preceding Halloween   where trick or treating is done from parked car to parked car in a local parking lot  often at a school or church  This annual event began in 2010  The trunk of one s car is opened  displaying candy  and often sometimes games and decorations  Concerned parents see it as safer for their children  while other parents see it as an easier alternative to walking the neighborhood with their kids  Some have called for more city or community group sponsored Trunk or Treats  so they can be more inclusive  These have become increasingly popular in recent years   Churches are expanding on the original idea of trunk or treat by adding food  music  games and rides  Their goal is to reach more of the community with an alternative to trick or treat  It not only has become a way to provide an alternative for children in the church but to the entire community  They have also found that it opens up opportunities to invite parents and children to other events or services going on at the church  To this end  some church groups hand out tracts or other information on the church at a Trunk or Treat   2 3  Other  Children of the St  Louis  Missouri area are expected to perform a joke  usually a simple Halloween themed pun or riddle  before receiving any candy  this  trick  earns the  treat   Children in Des Moines  Iowa also tell jokes or otherwise perform before receiving their treat  In some parts of Ohio  Iowa  Massachusetts and other states  the night designated for trick or treating is referred to as Beggars Night  and in some communities it is held on a night prior to Halloween itself   In most areas of the United States and Canada  trick or treating is a practice strictly meant for children  In fact  several US cities have banned trick or treaters older than 12 from participating in the event  and most young people stop trick or treating by the age of fourteen  In both countries it is expected that a teenager will transition into more mature expressions of celebrating the holiday  such as fancy dress  games and diversions like bonfires and bobbing for apples  and sweets like caramel apples  and teenagers will often attend school or community events with a Halloween theme where there will be dancing and music   In some parts of Canada  children sometimes say  Halloween apples  instead of  trick or treat   This probably originated when the toffee apple was a popular type of candy  Apple giving in much of Canada  however  has been taboo since the 1960s when stories  of almost certainly questionable authenticity  appeared of razors hidden inside Halloween apples  parents began to check over their children s  loot  for safety before allowing them to eat it  In Quebec  children also go door to door on Halloween  However  in French speaking neighbourhoods  instead of  Trick or treat    they will simply say  Halloween   though in tradition it used to be La charité s il vous plaît   Charity  please     In Portugal children go from house to house in All Saints day and All Souls Day  carrying pumpkin carved lanterns called coca  asking every one they see for Pão por Deus singing rhymes where they remind people why they are begging  saying     It is for me and for you  and to give to the deceased who are dead and buried       or       It is to share with your deceased        If a door is not open or the children don t get anything  they end their singing saying       In this house smells like lard  here must live someone deceased   In the Azores the bread given to the children takes the shape of the top of a skull  The tradition of pão por Deus was already recorded in the 15th century  After this ritual begging  takes place the Magusto and big bonfires are lit with the  firewood of the souls   The young people play around smothering their faces with the ashes  The ritual begging for the deceased used to take place all over the year as in several regions the dead  those who were dear  were expected to arrive and take part in the major celebrations like Christmas and a plate with food or a seat at the table was always left for them   In Sweden children dress up as witches and go trick or treating on Maundy Thursday  the Thursday before Easter  while Danish children dress up in various attires and go trick or treating on Fastelavn  or the next day  Shrove Monday   In Norway  trick or treat  is called  knask eller knep   which means almost the same thing  although with the word order reversed  and the practice is quite common among children  who come dressed up to people s doors asking for  mainly  candy  Many Norwegians prepare for the event by consciously buying a small stock of sweets prior to it  to come in handy should any kids come knocking on the door  which is very probable in most areas  The Easter witch tradition is done on Palm Sunday in Finland  In parts of Flanders and some parts of the Netherlands and most areas of Germany  Switzerland and Austria  children go to houses with homemade beet lanterns or with paper lanterns  which can hold a candle or electronic light   singing songs about St  Martin on St  Martin s Day  the 11th of November   in return for treats  In Northern Germany and Southern Denmark children dress up in costumes and go trick or treating on New Year s Eve in a tradition called  Rummelpott    3  See also  Hop tu Naa  Poisoned candy scare  Samhain  4  References  5  Further reading  Ben Truwe  The
