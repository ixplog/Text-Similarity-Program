The Book of the Courtier     is a courtesy book  It was written by Baldassare Castiglione over the course of many years  beginning in 1508  and published in 1528 by the Aldine Press in Venice just before his death  an English edition was published in 1561  It addresses the constitution of a perfect courtier  and in its last installment  a perfect lady   The Book of the Courtier is an example of the Renaissance dialogue  a literary form that incorporated elements of drama  conversation  philosophy  and essay  Considered the definitive account of Renaissance court life  it is cited frequently along with Stefano Guazzo s The civil conversation  1574  and Giovanni Della Casa s Galateo  1558   They are among the most important Renaissance works of the Italian Renaissance   1  Principles  The book is organized as a series of fictional conversations that occur between the courtiers of the Duke of Urbino in 1507  when Castiglione was in fact part of the Duke s Court   In the book  the courtier is described as having a cool mind  a good voice  with beautiful  elegant and brave words  along with proper bearing and gestures  At the same time though  the courtier is expected to have a warrior spirit  to be athletic  and have good knowledge of the humanities  Classics and fine arts  Over the course of four evenings  members of the court try to describe the perfect gentleman of the court  In the process they debate the nature of nobility  humor  women  and love   2  Reception  The Book of the Courtier was one of the most widely distributed books of the 16th century  with editions printed in six languages and in twenty European centers  The 1561 English translation by Thomas Hoby had a great influence on the English upper class s conception of English gentlemen   3  Rhetoric  Of the many qualities Castiglione’s characters attribute to their imperfection of the courtier  oratory and the manner in which courtier presents himself while speaking is amongst one of the most highly discussed  Wayne Rebhorn  a Castiglione scholar  states that the courtier’s speech and behavior in general is “designed to make people marvel at him  to transform himself into a beautiful spectacle for others to contemplate   As explained by Count Ludovico  the success of the courtier depends greatly on his reception by the audience from the first impression  This partly explains why the group considers the courtier s dress so vital to his success   Castiglione s characters opine about how their courtier can impress his audience and win its approval  Similar to the Classical Roman rhetoricians Cicero and Quintilian  Castiglione stresses the importance of delivery while speaking  In Book I  the Count states that when the courtier speaks he must have a “sonorous  clear  sweet and well sounding” voice that is neither too effeminate nor too rough and be “tempered by a calm face and with a play of the eyes that shall give an effect of grace ”  Castiglione 1 33  This grace  or grazia  becomes an important element in the courtier’s appearance to the audience  Edoardo Saccone states in his analysis of Castiglione  “grazia consists of  or rather is obtained through  sprezzatura ”  According to the Count  sprezzatura is amongst one of the most important  if not the most important  rhetorical device the courtier needs  Peter Burke describes sprezzatura in The Book of the Courtier as “nonchalance”  “careful negligence”  and “effortless and ease ” The ideal courtier is someone who “conceals art  and presents what is done and said as if it was done without effort and virtually without thought ”  31    The Count advocates the courtier engage in sprezzatura  or this “certain nonchalance”  in all the activities he participates in  especially speech  In Book I  he states   Accordingly we may affirm that to be true art which does not appear to be art  nor to anything must we give greater care than to conceal art  for if it is discovered  it quite destroys our credit and brings us into small esteem    Castiglione 1 26  The Count reasons that by obscuring his knowledge of letters  the courtier gives the appearance that his “orations were composed very simply” as if they sprang up from “nature and truth  rather  than from study and art ”  1 26   This much more natural appearance  even though it is not natural by any means  is more advantageous to the courtier   The Count contends that if the courtier wants to attain grazia and be esteemed excellent  it would be in his best interest to have this appearance of nonchalance  By failing to employ sprezzatura  he destroys his opportunity for grace  By applying sprezzatura to his speech and everything else he does  the courtier appears to have grazia and impresses his audience  thereby achieving excellence and perfection   Saccone 16    Another feature of rhetoric which Castiglione discusses is the role of written language and style  Castiglione declined to imitate Boccaccio and write in Tuscan Italian  as was customary at the time  instead he wrote in the Italian used in his native Lombardy  he was born near Mantua   as the Count says  “certainly it would require a great deal of effort on my part if in these discussions of ours I wished to use those old Tuscan words which the Tuscans of today have discarded  and what’s more I’m sure you would all laugh at me”  Courtier 70   Here  the use of the old and outdated Tuscan language is seen as a form of excess rather than a desirable trait  Castiglione states that had he followed Tuscan usage in his book  his description of sprezzatura would appear hypocritical  in that his effort would be seen without a sense of nonchalance  Courtier 71    Federico responds to the Count s assessment of the use of spoken language by posing the question as to what is the best language in which to write rhetoric  The Count’s response basically states that the language does not matter  but rather the style  authority  and grace of the work matters most  Courtier 71   Robert J  Graham  a Renaissance literary scholar  notes that “questions of whose language is privileged at any given historical moment are deeply implicated in matters of personal  social and cultural significance”  which he states is the primary reason for Castiglione’s usage of the native vernacular  This also illustrates the Count’s response on the relativity of language in Latin  With the role of language set  Castiglione begins to describe the style and authority in which the courtier must write in order to become successful   The Count explains   it is right that greater pains would be taken to make what is written more polished and correct…they should be chosen from the most beautiful of those employed in speech   Courtier 71   This is where the style of which the courtier writes encourages the persuasiveness or successfulness of a speech  The success of a written speech  in contrast to the spoken speech  hinges on the notion that  we are willing to tolerate a great deal of improper and even careless usage  in oral rhetoric than written rhetoric  The Count explains that along with proper word usage  an ideal courtier must have a proper sense of style and flow to their words  These words must be factual yet entertaining as the Count states  “then  it is necessary to arrange what is to be said or written in its logical order  and after that to express it well in words that  if I am not mistaken  should be appropriate  carefully chosen  clear and well formed  but above all that are still in popular use   Courtier 77   This form of emphasis on language is noted by Graham as   Although the Count is aware that more traditional aspects of the orator  appearance  gestures  voice  etc  …all this will be futile and of little consequence if the ideas conveyed by these words themselves are not witty or elegant to the requirements of the situation”  Graham 49    4  See also  Sprezzatura  5  References
