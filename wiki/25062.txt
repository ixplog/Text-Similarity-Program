Palestinian views on the peace process refer to the views of Palestinians in the ongoing peace talks with Israel   1  Background  Palestinians have held diverse views and perceptions of the peace process  A key starting point for understanding these views is an awareness of the differing objectives sought by advocates of the Palestinian cause   New Historian  Israeli academic Ilan Pappe says the cause of the conflict from a Palestinian point of view dates back to 1948 with the creation of Israel  rather than Israel’s views of 1967 being the crucial point and the return of occupied territories being central to peace negotiations   and that the conflict has been a fight to bring home refugees to a Palestinian state  Therefore this for some was the ultimate aim of the peace process  and for groups such as Hamas still is  However Slater says that this ‘maximalist’ view of a destruction of Israel in order to regain Palestinian lands  a view held by Arafat and the PLO initially  has steadily moderated from the late 1960s onwards to a preparedness to negotiate and instead seek a two state solution  The Oslo Accords demonstrated the recognition of this acceptance by the then Palestinian leadership of the state of Israel’s right to exist in return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and West Bank  However there are recurrent themes prevalent throughout peace process negotiations including a feeling that Israel offers too little and a mistrust of its actions and motives  Yet  the demand for the  Right of Return   ROR  by descendants of Palestinian refugees to Israel has remained a cornerstone of the Palestinian view and has been repeatedly enunciated by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas who is leading the Palestinian peace effort   2  Yasser Arafat and the PLO  The PLO has complex  often contradictory attitudes toward the peace process  Officially  the PLO acceptance of Israel s right to exist in peace was the first of the PLO s obligations in the Oslo Accords  In Yasser Arafat s September 9  1993 letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin  as part of the first Oslo accord  Arafat stated that  The PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security   Remarks from Arafat a shift away from one of the PLO s primary aims—the destruction of Israel   However  evidence throughout history and even during the 1990s and 2000s have shown that the PLO leadership considered any peace made with Israel to be temporary until the dream of Israel s destruction could be realized  Arafat often spoke of the peace process in terms of  justice  for the Palestinians  terms historian Efraim Karsh described as  euphemisms rooted in Islamic and Arabic history for the liberation of the whole of Palestine from  foreign occupiers    When describing his views of the peace process among Arab leaders and in the media of the Arab world  Arafat s rhetoric became noticeably more bellicose than it was when among Western leaders and media outside of the Arab world  The period saw a disconnect between what the PLO s second in command Abu Iyad referred to as  the language of peace  and support of Palestinian terrorism   Since the 1990s  there has been a debate within the PLO as to whether to halt terrorist activities completely or to continue attacking Israel as well as negotiate diplomatically with Israel  In practice  terrorism was never fully banned  Furthermore  assassination attempts by radical Palestinian factions within the PLO since the early years of the peace process kept Arafat from expressing full  public support of the peace process or condemnation of terrorism without risking further danger to his own life   In 2000  after Yasser Arafat rejected the offer made to him by Ehud Barak based on the two state solution and declined to negotiate for a more favorable offer  it became clear that Arafat would not make a deal with Israel unless it included the full Palestinian right of return  which would demographically destroy the Jewish character of the State of Israel  For this reason  critics of Arafat claim that he put his desire to destroy the Jewish state above his dream of building an autonomous Palestinian state   3  Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad  The stated goal of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad is to conquer Israel and replace it with an Islamist state  Both groups reject the Oslo Accords and other plans for peace with Israel  Throughout the 1990s and 2000s  the two groups worked together to derail the peace process by attacking Israeli civilians  Hamas undertook a ceasefire with Israel in August 2004  The Palestinian Islamic Jihad was unhappy with the ceasefire  In September 2005  Hamas was criticized by Islamic Jihad for calling off rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza   In 2008  Hamas publicly offered a long term hudna  truce  with Israel if Israel agreed to return to its 1967 borders and to grant the  right of return  to all Palestinian refugees  In 2010  Ismail Haniyeh announced that Hamas would accept the outcome of a Palestinian referendum on a peace treaty with Israel even if the results were not in line with their ideology  This represented a departure from their earlier insistence that they would not be bound by any such result  In 2012  Mousa Abu Marzook  a high ranking Hamas official in competition with Haniyeh for Hamas  top leadership post  gave an interview in which he expressed a range of opinions  some of which differed from the organisation s actual stance  He said that Hamas will not recognize Israel and will not feel bound to understand a peace treaty negotiated by Fatah as a recognition of Israel  calling instead for a hudna  temporary truce   Abu Marzook echoed Haniyeh s demand that Palestinians should be given the unconditional right to return into what is now Israel proper   4  Prominent Palestinians  When Sari Nusseibeh was the representative of the Palestinian Authority in Jerusalem  circa 2000   he called for historic compromises by both Palestinians and Israelis  to secure a permanent and lasting peace  For example  he stated that Palestinians must give up their claim of a right of return  With this concession  he argued  a true and lasting peace could emerge   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said on August 5  2000   Palestinians are no strangers to compromise  In the 1993 Oslo Accords  we agreed to recognize Israeli sovereignty over 78 percent of historic Palestine and to establish a Palestinian state on only 22 percent   Rashid Abu Shbak  a senior PA security official declared   The light which has shone over Gaza and Jericho  when the PA assumed control over those areas  will also reach the Negev and the Galilee  which constitute a large portion of pre 1967 Israel     The PA s Voice of Palestine radio station broadcast a Friday prayer sermon by Yusuf Abu Sneineh  official preacher at Jerusalem s Al Aqsa Mosque  over the radio  In it  he asserted   The struggle we are waging is an ideological struggle and the question is  where has the Islamic land of Palestine gone  Where  are  Haifa and Jaffa  Lod and Ramle  Acre  Safed and Tiberias  Where is Hebron and Jerusalem    PA cabinet minister Abdul Aziz Shaheen told the official PA newspaper  Al Havat Al Jadida  on January 4  1998   The Oslo accord was a preface for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority will be a preface for the Palestinian state which  in its turn  will be a preface for the liberation of the entire Palestinian land    Faisal Husseini  former Palestinian Authority Minister for Jerusalem  compared the al Aqsa intifada following the Oslo peace process to the tactic of coming out of the Trojan Horse used by the Greeks in the myth of the Trojan War   5  References  6  External links  online interview with Fawaz Gerges  washingtonpost com  8 February 2005   by Aluma Solnik and Yotam Feldner  Middle East Media Research
