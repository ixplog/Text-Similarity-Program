Transport in the United Kingdom is facilitated with road  air  rail  and water networks  A radial road network totals of main roads  of motorways and of paved roads  The National Rail network of 10 072 route miles  16 116 km  in Great Britain and 189 route miles  303 route km  in Northern Ireland carries over 18 000 passenger and 1 000 freight trains daily  Urban rail networks exist in London  Manchester  Birmingham  Edinburgh  Glasgow  Cardiff  Belfast  Leeds and Liverpool  There are many regional and international airports  with Heathrow Airport in London being one of the busiest in the world  The UK also has a network of ports which received over 558 million tons of goods in 2003舑2004   1  Transport trends  Since 1952  the earliest date for which comparable figures are available   the United Kingdom has seen a growth of car use  increasing its modal share  while the use of buses has declined  and railway use has grown more slowly   In 1952 27% of distance travelled was by car or taxi  with 42% being by bus or coach and 18% by rail  A further 11% was by bicycle and 3% by motorcycle  The distance travelled by air was negligible   By 2003 85% of distance travelled was by car or taxi  with 6% being by bus and 6% by rail  Air  pedal cycle and motorcycle accounted for roughly 1% each  In terms of journeys  slightly over 1 billion are made per annum by main line rail  1 billion by light rail  4 5 billion by bus  and 21 million on domestic air flights   Passenger transport has grown in recent years  Figures from the DTI show that total passenger travel inside the United Kingdom has risen from 403 billion passenger kilometres in 1970 to 797 billion in 2004   Freight transport has undergone similar changes  increasing in volume and shifting from railways onto the road  In 1953 89 billion tonne kilometres of goods were moved  with rail accounting for 42%  road 36% and water 22%  By 2002 the volume of freight moved had almost trebled to 254 billion tonne kilometres  of which 7 5% was moved by rail  26% by water  4% by pipeline and 62% by road  Despite the growth in tonne kilometres  the environmental external costs of trucks and lorries in the UK have reportedly decreased  Between 1990 and 2000  there has been a move to heavier goods vehicles due to major changes in the haulage industry including a shift in sales to larger articulated vehicles  A larger than average fleet turnover has ensured a swift introduction of new and cleaner vehicles in the UK   Although the decline in railway use led to a reduction in the length of the rail network  the length of the road network has not increased in proportion to the increase in road use  Whereas the rail network has halved from in 1950 to today  the major road network only increased from in 1951 to in 1990  and reduced slightly to by 2010  In 2008  the Department for Transport stated that traffic congestion is one of the most serious transport problems facing the United Kingdom  According to the government sponsored Eddington report of 2006  bottleneck roads are in serious danger of becoming so congested that it may damage the economy   2  Air transport  There are 471 airports and airfields in the United Kingdom  of which 334 are paved  There are also 11 heliports   2004 CIA estimates   BAA is the United Kingdom s largest airport operator  its flagship being London Heathrow Airport  the largest traffic volume international airport in the world and is the world s busiest airports  Gatwick Airport  the second largest  is owned by Global Infrastructure Partners and was previously owned by BAA  The third largest is Manchester Airport  in Manchester  which is run by Manchester Airport Group  which also owns various other airports   Other major airports include London Stansted Airport in Essex  about north of London and Birmingham Airport  in Solihull   Outside England  Cardiff Airport  Edinburgh Airport and Belfast International Airport  are the busiest airports serving Wales  Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively   The largest airline in the United Kingdom is British Airways  Others include easyJet  Monarch Airlines  Flybe  Jet2  Thomson Airways and Virgin Atlantic   3  Railways  The rail network in the United Kingdom consists of two independent parts  that of Northern Ireland and that of Great Britain  Since 1994  the latter has been connected to mainland Europe via the Channel Tunnel  The network of Northern Ireland is connected to that of the Republic of Ireland  The National Rail network of in Great Britain and 189 route miles  303 route km  in Northern Ireland carries over 18 000 passenger trains and 1 000 freight trains daily  Urban rail networks are also well developed in London and several other cities  There were once over of rail network in the UK  however  most of this was reduced over a time period from 1955 to 1975  much of it after a report by a government advisor Richard Beeching in the mid 1960s  known as the Beeching Axe    3 1  Great Britain  The rail network in Great Britain is the oldest such network in the world  The system consists of five high speed main lines  the West Coast  East Coast  Midland  Great Western and Great Eastern   which radiate from London to the rest of the country  augmented by regional rail lines and dense commuter networks within the major cities  High Speed 1 is operationally separate from the rest of the network  and is built to the same standard as the TGV system in France   The world s first intercity railway was the Liverpool and Manchester Railway  designed by George Stephenson and opened by the Prime Minister  the Duke of Wellington on 15 September 1830  The network grew rapidly as a patchwork of literally hundreds of separate companies during the Victorian era  which eventually was consolidated into just four by 1922  as the boom in railways ended and they began to lose money  Eventually the entire system came under state control in 1948  under the British Transport Commission s Railway Executive  After 1962 it came under the control of the British Railways Board  then British Railways  later British Rail   and the network was reduced to less than half of its original size by the infamous Beeching cuts of the 1960s when many unprofitable branch lines were closed  Several stations have been reopened in Wales  British Rail during 1986 electrified the Hastings Line   In 1994 and 1995  British Rail was split into infrastructure  maintenance  rolling stock  passenger and freight companies  which were privatised from 1996 to 1997  The privatisation has delivered very mixed results with healthy passenger growth  mass refurbishment of infrastructure  investment in new rolling stock  and safety improvements being offset by concerns over network capacity and the overall cost to the taxpayer  It has also led to some confusion as to who looks after different aspects of the rail service among the general public  This is because for example  different companies run the tracks to those that run the trains and locomotives   In Britain  the infrastructure  track  stations  depots and signalling chiefly  is owned and maintained by Network Rail  a not for profit company  Network Rail replaced Railtrack  which became bankrupt in 2002 following the Hatfield rail crash in 2000  Passenger services are operated by train operating companies  TOCs   which are franchises awarded by the United Kingdom Government or the Scottish Government  Examples include First Group  East Coast and Virgin Trains  Freight trains are operated by Freight Operating Companies  such as DB Schenker Rail  UK   which are commercial operations unsupported by government  Most Train Operating Companies do not own the locomotives and coaches that they use to operate passenger services  Instead  they are required to lease these from the three Rolling Stock Operating Companies  ROSCOs   with train maintenance carried out by companies such as Bombardier and Alstom   In Great Britain there is of gauge track  reduced from a historic peak of over   Of this  is electrified and is double or multiple tracks  The maximum scheduled speed on the regular network has historically been around on the InterCity lines  On High Speed 1  trains are now able to reach the speeds of French TGVs   A High Speed 2 line running north from London has been proposed and the legislation needed for the first phase is  as of May 2014  proceeding through parliament  Network Rail are considering reopening a line in south west England connecting Tavistock to Okehampton and Exeter as an alternative to the coastal mainline which was damaged at Dawlish by coastal storms in February 2014  causing widespread disruption   3 2  Northern Ireland  In Northern Ireland  Northern Ireland Railways  NIR  both owns the infrastructure and operates passenger rail services  The Northern Ireland rail network is one of the few networks in Europe that carry no freight  It is publicly owned  NIR was united in 1996 with Northern Ireland s two publicly owned bus operators — Ulsterbus and Metro  formally Citybus  — under the brand Translink   In Northern Ireland there is of track at gauge  of it is double track   3 3  International rail services  Eurostar operates trains via the Channel Tunnel to France and Belgium and Enterprise trains link Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland   3 4  Rapid transit  Two cities in the United Kingdom have rapid transit systems  The most well known is the London Underground  commonly known as the Tube   the oldest rapid transit system in the world  Another system in London is the separate Docklands Light Railway  though this is more of a light metro system due to its lower passenger capacities  further  it is integrated with the Underground in many ways   Outside of London  there is the Glasgow Subway which is the third oldest rapid transit system in the world  One other system  the Tyne and Wear Metro  has some similarities to a rapid transit system  but is generally considered to be light rail   3 5  Urban rail  Urban commuter rail networks are focused on many of the country s major cities   Belfast   Belfast Suburban Rail  Birmingham   London Midland City  Bristol   First Great Western and proposed Greater Bristol Metro  Cardiff   Valley Lines  Edinburgh   First ScotRail  Glasgow   First ScotRail  Leeds   MetroTrain  Liverpool   Merseyrail  London   London Underground and London Overground  with Crossrail under construction   Manchester   Northern Rail and First TransPennine Express They consist of several railway lines connecting city centre stations of major cities to suburbs and surrounding towns  Train services and ticketing are fully integrated with the national rail network and are not considered separate   In London  a route for Crossrail 2 has been safeguarded   3 6  Trams and light rail  Tram systems were popular in the United Kingdom in the late 19th and early 20th century  However  with the rise of the car they began to be widely dismantled in the 1950s  By 1962 only the Blackpool tramway and the Glasgow Corporation Tramways remained  the final Glasgow service was withdrawn on 2 September 1962  Recent years have seen a revival the United Kingdom  as in other countries  of trams together with light rail systems   4  Roads  The road network in Great Britain  in 2006  consists of of trunk roads  including of motorway   of principal roads  including of motorway   of  B  and  C  roads  and of unclassified roads  mainly local streets and access roads  舒 totalling    Road is the most popular method of transportation in the United Kingdom  carrying over 90% of motorised passenger travel and 65% of domestic freight  The major motorways and trunk roads  many of which are dual carriageway  form the trunk network which links all cities and major towns  these carry about one third of the nation s traffic  and occupy about 0 16% of its land area   The motorway system  which was constructed from the 1950s onwards  is stated by the British Chambers of Commerce to be  by virtually every measurement of motorway capacity  well below the capacity of other leading European nations  They give comparative figures for a selection of nations of  units   km million population   Luxembourg 280  Spain 225  Austria 200  France 185  Belgium 165  Denmark 165  Sweden 165  Netherlands 140  Germany 140  Italy 115  Finland 100  Portugal 80  United Kingdom 60  Greece 45 and Ireland 30   The Highways Agency  an Executive Agency of the Department for Transport  is responsible for maintaining motorways and trunk roads in England  Other English roads are maintained by local authorities  In Scotland and Wales roads are the responsibility of Transport Scotland  an Executive Agency of the Scottish Government  and the Welsh Assembly Government respectively  Northern Ireland s roads are overseen by the Roads Service Northern Ireland  a section of the Department for Regional Development  In London  Transport for London is responsible for all trunk roads and other major roads  which are part of the Transport for London Road Network   Toll roads are rare in the United Kingdom  though there are many toll bridges such as the Severn crossing  Road traffic congestion has been identified as a key concern for the future prosperity of the United Kingdom  and policies and measures are being investigated and developed by the government to ameliorate its effects  In 2003  the United Kingdom s first toll motorway  the M6 Toll  opened in the West Midlands area to relieve the congested M6 motorway  Rod Eddington  in his 2006 Transport’s role in sustaining the UK’s productivity and competitiveness report  recommended that the congestion problem should be tackled with a  sophisticated policy mix  of congestion targeted road pricing and improving the capacity and performance of the transport network through infrastructure investment and better use of the existing network  Congestion charging systems do operate in the cities of London and Durham and on the Dartford Crossing  In 2005  the Government published proposals for a United Kingdom wide road pricing scheme  This was designed to be revenue neutral with other motoring taxes to be reduced to compensate  The plans have been extremely controversial with 1 8 million people signing a petition against them   Driving is on the left  The maximum speed limit is 70 miles per hour  112 km h  on motorways and dual carriageways   5  Road passenger transport  5 1  Buses  Local bus services cover the whole country  Since deregulation the majority  80% by the late 1990s  of these local bus companies have been taken over by one of the  Big Five  private transport companies  Arriva  part of Deutsche Bahn AG   First Group  Go Ahead Group  National Express Group  owners of National Express  and Stagecoach Group  In Northern Ireland coach  bus  and rail  services remain state owned and are provided by Translink   5 2  Coaches  Coaches provide long distance links throughout the United Kingdom  in England and Wales the majority of coach services are provided by National Express  Megabus run no frills coach services in competition with National Express and services in Scotland in co operation with Scottish Citylink   6  Water transport  Due to the United Kingdom s island nature  before the Channel Tunnel and the advent of air travel the only way to enter or leave the country was on water  except at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland   6 1  Ports and harbours  Approximately 95% of freight enters the United Kingdom by sea  75% by value   Three major ports handle most freight traffic   Grimsby & Immingham on the east coast   Port of London  on the River Thames   Milford Haven  in south west Wales  There are many other ports and harbours around the United Kingdom  including the following towns and cities   Aberdeen  Avonmouth  Barrow  Barry  Belfast  Boston  Bristol  Cardiff  Dover  Edinburgh Leith  Falmouth  Felixstowe  Fishguard  Glasgow  Gloucester  Grangemouth  Grimsby  Harwich  Heysham  Holyhead  Hull  Kirkwall  Larne  Liverpool  Londonderry  Manchester  Oban  Peterhead  Plymouth  Poole  Port Talbot  Portishead  Portsmouth  Scapa Flow  Southampton  Stornoway  Stranraer  Sullom Voe  Swansea  Tees  Tyne   6 2  Merchant marine  For long periods of the last millennium Britain had the largest merchant fleet in the world  but it has slipped down the rankings as the use of Flags of convenience has grown  There are 429 ships of or over  making a total of     These are split into the following types  bulk carrier 18  cargo ship 55  chemical tanker 48  container ship 134  liquefied gas 11  passenger ship 12  passenger cargo ship 64  petroleum tanker 40  refrigerated cargo ship 19  roll on roll off 25  vehicle carrier 3  There are also 446 ships registered in other countries  and 202 foreign owned ships registered in the United Kingdom   2005 CIA estimate   6 3  Ferries  Ferries  both passenger only and passengers and vehicles  operate within the United Kingdom across rivers and stretches of water  In London the Woolwich Ferry links the North and South circular roads  Gosport and Portsmouth are linked by the Gosport Ferry  Southampton and Isle of Wight are linked by ferry and fast Catamaran ferries  North Shields and South Shields on Tyneside are linked by the Shields Ferry  and the Mersey has the Mersey Ferry   In Scotland  Caledonian MacBrayne provides passenger and RO RO ferry services in the Firth of Clyde  to various islands from Oban and within the inner and outer Hebrides  Orkney Ferries provides services within the Orkney Isles  and NorthLink Ferries provides services from the Scottish mainland to Orkney and Shetland  mainly from Aberdeen although other ports are also used  Ferries operate to Northern Ireland from Stranraer and Cairnryan to Larne and Belfast   Holyhead  in Wales  is the principal ferry port for Wales and England to Dublin and Dún Laoghaire  in Ireland   Passenger ferries operate internationally to nearby countries such as France  the Republic of Ireland  Belgium  the Netherlands  Denmark and Spain  Ferries usually originate from one of the following   Dover with services to Calais operated by P&O Ferries  My Ferry Link and DFDS Seaways   Portsmouth International Port is the main hub for longer services on the Western Channel to Ouistreham  Le Havre  Cherbourg and Saint Malo in France  and Santander and Bilbao in Spain  Most services are operated by French company Brittany Ferries with some to Cherbourg and Le Havre by Condor Ferries and DFDS Seaways   Services from Plymouth operate to Santander  Spain  and Roscoff  France  with Brittany Ferries   Services from Weymouth and Poole operate to the Channel Islands with Condor Ferries and to Cherbourg  from Poole  with Brittany Ferries   Holyhead is the principal ferry port for services to Ireland  operated by Irish Ferries and Stena Line with some services originating from Pembroke   Hull and Harwich are the main hubs for services to the Netherlands  More services from Ramsgate  Liverpool  Newhaven  Southampton  Lymington and Fishguard operate to Ireland  France  Belgium and the Isle of Wight   Waterbuses operate on rivers in some of the country s largest cities such as London  London River Services and Thames Clippers   Cardiff  Cardiff Waterbus  and Bristol  Bristol Ferry Boat    6 4  Other shipping  Cruise ships depart from the United Kingdom for destinations worldwide  many heading for ports around the Mediterranean and Caribbean  The Cunard Line still offer a scheduled transatlantic service between Southampton and New York with RMS Queen Mary 2  The Solent is a world centre for yachting and home to largest number of private yachts in the world   6 5  Inland waterways  see canals of the United Kingdom  Major canal building began in the United Kingdom after the onset of the Industrial revolution in the 18th century  A large canal network was built and it became the primary method of transporting goods throughout the country  however  by the 1830s with the development of the railways  the canal network began to go into decline   There are currently of waterways in the United Kingdom and the primary use is recreational  is used for commerce   2004 CIA estimate   7  Education and professional development  The United Kingdom also has a well developed network of organisations offering education and professional development in the transport and logistics sectors   7 1  Educational organisations  A number of Universities offer degree programmes in transport  usually covering transportation planning  engineering of transport infrastructure  and management of transport and logistics services  The Institute for Transport Studies  University of Leeds is one such organisation   7 2  Professional development  Professional development for those working in the transport and logistics sectors is provided by a number of Professional Institutes representing specific sectors  These include   Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport  CILT UK    Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation  CIHT   Institution of Railway Operators  Transport Planning Society  TPS  Through these professional bodies  transport planners and engineers can train for a number of professional qualifications  including   Chartered Engineer  Incorporated Engineer  Transport Planning Professional  8  See also  Air transport of the
