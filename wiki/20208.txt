Margaret Alice Murray  13 July 1863 – 13 November 1963  was a prominent English Egyptologist  archaeologist  anthropologist  and folklorist  The first female to be appointed as a lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom  she worked at University College London  UCL  from 1898 to 1935  She served as President of the Folklore Society from 1953 to 1955  and published widely over the course of her career   Born to a wealthy middle class family in Calcutta  British India  Murray divided her youth between India and Britain  training as both a nurse and a social worker  In 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL  developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie  who appointed her Junior Professor in 1898  In 1902舑03 she took part in Petrie s excavations at Abydos  Egypt  there discovering the Osireion temple  and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery  both of which established her reputation in Egyptology  On return to London she became closely involved in the first wave feminist movement and devoted much time to improving women s status at UCL   Undertaking public lectures at Manchester Museum  where she became the first woman to publicly unwrap a mummy in 1908  she began to author books on Egyptology for a general audience  Unable to return to Egypt due to World War I  she focused her research into the witch cult hypothesis  the theory that the witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre Christian  pagan religion devoted to a Horned God  Although later academically discredited  the theory provided a significant influence on the religion of Wicca  From 1921 to 1931 she undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on Malta and Minorca  and developed her interest in folkloristics  Appointed assistant professor in 1928  she was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927 and retired in 1935  She continued lecturing and publishing in an independent capacity until her death   Murray has been recognised as one of the earliest women to  make a serious impact upon the world of professional scholarship   Although widely acclaimed for her work in Egyptology  Murray s work in folkloristics and the history of witchcraft has been discredited and her reputation tarnished in those fields   1  Biography  1 1  Youth  1863舑93  Margaret Murray was born on 13 July 1863 in Calcutta  West Bengal  then a major military city in British India  A member of the wealthy British imperial elite  she lived in the city with her family  parents James and Margaret Murray  an older sister named Mary  and her paternal grandmother and great grandmother  James Murray was an Indian born English businessman who worked as manager of the Serampore paper mills  and was thrice elected President of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce  His wife  Margaret  née Carr  had been born in Britain but had moved to India in 1857 to work as a missionary preaching Christianity and educating Indian women  She continued with this work after marrying James and giving birth to her two daughters  Although most of their lives were spent in the wealthy European area of Calcutta  walled off from the indigenous sectors of the city  Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family s employ of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie   In 1870  Margaret and her sister Mary were sent to Britain  there moving in with their uncle John  a vicar  and his wife Harriet at their home in Lambourn  Berkshire  Although John provided them with a strongly Christian education and a belief in the inferiority of women  John awakened Murray s interest in archaeology through taking her to see local monuments  In 1873  the girls  mother arrived in Europe and took them with her to Germany  where they both became fluent in German  In 1875 they returned to Calcutta  staying there till 1877  They then moved with their parents back to England  where they settled in Sydenham  South London  There  they spent much time visiting The Crystal Palace  while their father worked at his firm s London office  In 1880  they returned to Calcutta  where Margaret remained for the next seven years  She became a nurse at the Calcutta General Hospital  which was run by the Sisters of the Anglican Sisterhood of Clower  where she dealt with a cholera outbreak  In 1887  she returned to England  moving to Rugby  Warwickshire  where her uncle John had moved  now widowed  Here she took up employment as a social worker dealing with local underprivileged people  When her father retired and moved to England  she moved into his house in Bushey Heath  Hertfordshire  living with him until his death in 1891  In 1893 she then traveled to Madras  Tamil Nadu  where her sister had moved to with her new husband   1 2  Early years at University College London  1894舑1905  Encouraged by her mother and sister  Murray decided to enrol at the newly opened department of Egyptology at University College London  UCL  in Bloomsbury  Central London  Having been founded by an endowment from Amelia Blanford Edwards  one of the co founders of the Egypt Exploration Fund  EEF   the department was run by the pioneering early archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie  and based in the Edwards Library of UCL s South Cloisters  Murray began her studies at UCL aged 30 in January 1894  as part of a class that composed largely of other women and old men  There  she took courses in the Ancient Egyptian and Coptic languages which were taught by Francis Llewellyn Griffith and Walter Ewing Crum respectively   Murray soon got to know Petrie  becoming his copyist and illustrator and producing the drawings for the published report on his excavations at Qift  Koptos  In turn  he aided and encouraged her to write her first research paper   The Descent of Property in the Early Periods of Egyptian History   which was published in the Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology in 1895  Becoming Petrie s de facto though unofficial assistant  Murray began to give some of the linguistic lessons in Griffith s absence  In 1897 Murray was one of a group who unpacked  exhibited and drew plates from the excavation at El Kab  In 1898 she was appointed to the position of Junior Lecturer  responsible for teaching the linguistic courses at the Egyptology department  this made her the first female lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom  In this capacity  she spent two days a week at UCL  devoting the other days to caring for her ailing mother  As time went on  she came to teach courses on Ancient Egyptian history  religion  and language  Referring to her students as  the Gang   among some of her early individuals were Reginald Engelbach  Georgina Aitken  Guy Brunton  and Myrtle Broome  all of whom went on to produce noted contributions to Egyptology  She supplemented her UCL salary by teaching evening classes in Egyptology at the British Museum   At this point  Murray had no experience in field archaeology  and so during the 1902舑03 field season  she traveled to Egypt to join Petrie s excavations at Abydos  Petrie and his wife  Hilda Petrie  had been excavating at the site since 1899  having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar Émile Amélineau  Murray at first joined as site nurse  but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position  This led to some issues with a number of male excavators disliking the idea of taking orders from a woman  This experience  coupled with discussions with other female excavators  some of whom were active in the feminist movement  led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints  While excavating at Abydos  Murray uncovered the Osireion  a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom  She published her site report as The Osireion at Abydos in 1904  in which she examined the inscriptions that she discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building   During the 1903舑04 field season  Murray returned to Egypt  and at Petrie s instruction began her investigations at the Saqqara cemetery near to Cairo  which dated from the period of the Old Kingdom  Murray did not have legal permission to excavate the site  instead spending her time transcribing the inscriptions from ten of the tombs that had been excavated during the 1860s by Auguste Mariette  She published her findings in 1905 as Saqqara Mastabas I  although would not publish translations of the inscriptions until 1937 as Saqqara Mastabas II  Both The Osireion at Abydos and Saqqara Mastabas I proved to be very influential in the Egyptological community  with Petrie recognising Murray s contribution to his own career   1 3  Feminism  the First World War  and Folklore  1905舑20  On returning to London  Murray took an active role in the feminist movement  volunteering and financially donating to the cause and taking part in feminist demonstrations  protests  and marches  Joining the Women s Social and Political Union  she was present at large marches like the Mud March of 1907 and the Women s Coronation Procession of June 1911  She would however conceal the militancy of her actions in order to retain the image of respectability within academia  Murray also pushed the professional boundaries for women throughout her own career  and mentored other women in archaeology and throughout academia  As women could not use the men s common room  she successfully campaigned for UCL to open a common room for women  and later successfully ensured that a larger  better equipped room was converted for the purpose  it was later renamed the Margaret Murray Room  At UCL  she became a friend of fellow female lecturer Winifred Smith  and together they campaigned to improve the status and recognition of women in the university  with Murray becoming particularly annoyed at female staff who were afraid of upsetting or offending the male university establishment with their demands   Petrie had established connections with the Egyptological wing of Manchester Museum in Manchester  and it was there that many of his finds had been housed  Murray thus often travelled to the museum to catalogue these artefacts  and during the 1906舑07 school year regularly lectured there  In 1907  Petrie excavated the Tomb of the Two Brothers  a Middle Kingdom burial of two Egyptian priests  Nakht ankh and Khnum nakht  and it was decided that Murray would carry out the public unwrapping of the latter s mummified body  Taking place at the museum in May 1908  it represented the first time that a woman had led a public mummy unwrapping  and was attended by over 500 onlookers  attracting press attention  Murray was particularly keen to emphasise the importance that the unwrapping would have for the scholarly understanding of the Middle Kingdom and its burial practices  and lashed out against members of the public who saw it as immoral  she declared that “every vestige of ancient remains must be carefully studied and recorded without sentimentality and without fear of the outcry of the ignorant ” She subsequently published a book about her analysis of the two bodies  The Tomb of the Two Brothers   Murray was dedicated to public education  hoping to infuse Egyptomania with solid scholarship about Ancient Egypt  and to this end authored a series of books aimed at a general audience  In 1905 she published Elementary Egyptian Grammar which was followed in 1911 by Elementary Coptic  Sahidic  Grammar  In 1913  she published Ancient Egyptian Legends for John Murray s  The Wisdom of the East  series  She was particularly pleased with the increased public interest in Egyptology that followed Howard Carter s discovery of the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun in 1922  From at least 1911 until his death in 1940  Murray was a close friend of the anthropologist Charles Gabriel Seligman of the London School of Economics  and together they co authored a variety of papers on Egyptology that were aimed at an anthropological audience  Many of these dealt with subjects that Egyptological journals would not publish  such as the  Sa  sign for the uterus  and thus were published in Man  the journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute   In 1914  Petrie launched the academic journal Ancient Egypt  published through his own British School of Archaeology in Egypt  BSAE   which was based at UCL  Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt  Murray was left to operate as de facto editor much of the time  She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews   The outbreak of World War I in 1914  in which the United Kingdom went to war against Germany and the Ottoman Empire  meant that Petrie and other staff members were unable to return to Egypt for excavation  Instead  Petrie and Murray spent much of the time reorganising the artefact collections that they had attained over the past decades  To aid Britain s war effort  Murray enrolled as a volunteer nurse in the Volunteer Air Detachment of the College Women s Union Society  and for several weeks was posted to Saint Malo in France  However  after being taken ill herself  she was sent to recuperate in Glastonbury  Somerset  where she became interested in Glastonbury Abbey and the folklore surrounding it which connected it to the legendary figure of King Arthur and to the idea that the Holy Grail had been brought there by Joseph of Aramathea  Pursuing this interest  she published the paper  Egyptian Elements in the Grail Romance  in the journal Ancient Egypt  although few agreed with her conclusions and it was criticised by scholars like Jessie Weston for making unsubstantiated leaps with the evidence   1 4  The Witch Cult  Malta  and Minorca  1921舑35  Murray s interest in folklore led her to develop an interest in the witch trials of Early Modern Europe  In 1917  she published a paper in the Folklore journal which she first articulated her version of the witch cult theory  arguing that the witches persecuted in European history were actually followers of  a definite religion with beliefs  ritual  and organization as highly developed as that of any cult in the end   She articulated these views more fully in her 1921 book The Witch Cult in Western Europe  which received both criticism and support on publication  Many reviews in academic journals were critical  with historians claiming that she had distorted and misinterpreted the contemporary records that she was using  As a result of her work in this area  she was invited to provide the entry on  witchcraft  for the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1929  She used the opportunity to propagate her own Witch Cult theory  failing to mention the alternate theories proposed by other academics  Her entry would be included in the encyclopedia until 1969  becoming readily accessible to the public  and it was for this reason that her ideas on the subject had such a significant impact  Murray became active in the Folklore Society from 1927   From 1921 to 1927  Murray led archaeological excavations on Malta  assisted by Guest and Caton Thompson  She excavated the Bronze Age megalithic monuments of Santa Sfia  Santa Maria tal Bakkari  Għar Dalam  and Borġ in Nadur  all of which were threatened by the construction of a new aerodrome  In this she was funded by the Percy Sladen Memorial Fund  Her resulting three volume excavation report came to be seen as an important publication within the field of Maltese archaeology  During the excavations  she had taken an interest in the island s folklore  resulting in the 1932 publication of her book Maltese Folktales  In 1932 Murray returned to Malta to aid in the cataloguing of the Bronze Age pottery collection held in Malta Museum  resulting in her publication  Corpus of the Bronze Age Pottery of Malta  On the basis of her work in Malta  Louis C G  Clarke  the curator of the Cambridge Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology  invited her to lead excavations on the island of Minorca from 1930 to 1931  With the aid of Guest  she excavated the megalithic sites of Trapucó and Sa Torrera  resulting in the publication of Cambridge Excavations in Minorca  Murray also continued to publish works on Egyptology for a general audience  such as Egyptian Sculpture  1930  and Egyptian Temples  1931   which received largely positive reviews   In 1924  UCL promoted Murray to the position of assistant professor  and in 1927 she was awarded an honorary doctorate for her career in Egyptology  Although having reached legal retirement age in 1927  the rules were waived for Murray  and she was reappointed on an annual basis each year until 1935  At this point  she expressed the opinion that she was glad to leave UCL  for reasons that she did not make clear  In 1933  Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine with his wife  Murray therefore took over as editor of the Ancient Egypt journal  renaming it Ancient Egypt and the East to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt  However  in 1935 the journal ceased  perhaps due to Murray s retirement  Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem  where she aided the Petries in their excavation at Tall al Ajjul   Murray reiterated her Witch Cult theory in her 1931 book  The God of the Witches  From this publication  she cut out or toned down what she saw as the more unpleasant aspects of the Witch Cult  such as animal and child sacrifice  and her use of language became  emotionally inflated and coloured with religious phraseology    1 5  Retirement  1935舑63  From 1934 to 1940  Murray aided the cataloguing of Egyptian antiquities at Girton College  Cambridge  and also gave lectures in Egyptology at the university until 1942  During World War II  Murray escaped the Blitz of London by moving to Cambridge  where she volunteered for a group  probably either the Army Bureau of Current Affairs or The British Way and Purpose who educated military personnel to prepare them for post war life  Murray s interest in popularising Egyptology among the wider public continued  in 1949 she published Ancient Egyptian Religious Poetry  her second work for John Murray s  The Wisdom of the East  series  That same year she also published The Splendour That Was Egypt  in which she collated many of her UCL lectures  The book adopted a diffusionist perspective that argued that Egypt influenced Greco Roman society and thus modern Western society  This was seen as a compromise between Petrie s belief that other societies influenced the emergence of Egyptian civilisation and Grafton Elliot Smith s highly unorthodox and heavily criticised hyperdiffustionist view that Egypt was the source of all global civilisation  The book received a mixed reception from the archaeological community   In 1953  Murray was appointed to the presidency of the Folklore Society  the first time that she had served on the council  taking over from the former president  Allan Gomme  She remained President for two terms  until 1955  For the autumn 1961 issue of their Folklore journal  the Folklore Society published a festschrift to Murray to commemorate her 98th birthday  The issue contained contributions from various scholars paying tribute to her  with papers dealing with archaeology  fairies  Near Eastern religious symbols  Greek folksongs  but notably not about witchcraft  In May 1957  Murray had championed the archaeologist Thomas Charles Lethbridge s controversial claims that he had discovered three pre Christian chalk hill figures on Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Downs  Cambridgeshire  Privately however she expressed concern about the reality of the figures   Amid failing health  in 1962 Murray moved in to the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn  Hertfordshire  where she could receive 24 hour care  she lived here for the final 18 months of her life  Her doctor drove her to UCL to celebrate her 100th birthday  where a party was held in her honour attended by many of her friends  colleagues  and former students  That year she published her autobiography  My First Hundred Years  which received predominantly positive reviews  She died on 13 November 1963  and her corpse was cremated   2  Murray s Witch Cult hypotheses  2 1  Thesis  Murray s Witch Cult in Western Europe 1921  written during a period she was unable to do field work in Egypt  laid out the essential elements of her thesis that a common pattern of underground pagan resistance to the Christian Church existed across Europe  The pagans organized in covens of thirteen worshippers  dedicated to a male god and held ritual sabbaths  Murray maintained that pagan beliefs and religion  dating from the neolithic through the medieval period  secretly practiced human sacrifice until exposed by the witchhunt starting around 1450   In The Witch Cult in Western Europe  Murray stated that she had restricted her research to Great Britain  although made some recourse to sources from France  Flanders  and New England  She drew a division between what she termed  Operative Witchcraft   which referred to the performance of charms and spells with any purpose  and  Ritual Witchcraft   by which she meant  the ancient religion of Western Europe   a fertility based faith that she also termed  the Dianic cult   She claimed that the cult had  very probably  once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a  Mother Goddess  but that  at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female   Describing this witch cult as  a joyous religion   she claimed that the two primary festivals that it celebrated were on May Eve and November Eve  although that 1 February and 1 August were also observed   Murray asserted that paganism had survived the Christianisation process in Britain  although that it came to be  practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community   In her thesis  Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches  god   manifest and incarnate   to whom the witches offered their prayers  She claimed that at the witches  meetings  the god would be personified  usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal  when a human personified this entity  Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly  although appeared in full costume for the witches  Sabbaths   Murray s later books were written for a more popular audience and in a style that was far more imaginative and entertaining than standard academic works  The God of the Witches  1931  expanded on her claims that the witch cult had worshiped a Horned God whose origins went back to prehistory  Murray decided that the witches  admissions in trial that they worshiped Satan proved they actually did worship such a god  Thus  according to Murray  reports of Satan actually represented pagan gatherings with their priest wearing a horned helmet to represent their Horned God  Murray also discussed the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury  Thomas Becket  claiming to show that he too was a pagan by saying that his death  presents many features which are explicable only by the theory that he also was the substitute for a Divine King   Murray 171   Murray became more and more emotional in her defence of her ideas  claiming that anyone who opposed her did so out of religious prejudice  In The Divine King in England  1954  she expanded on her earlier claims there was a secret conspiracy of pagans amongst the English nobility  the same English nobility who provided the leading members of the Church  Murray claimed the suspicious death of King William II of England was a ritual sacrificial killing of a sacred king carried out by Henry I  a man so pious he later founded one of the biggest Abbeys in England  This secret conspiracy  according to her  had killed many early English sovereigns  through to James I in the early seventeenth century  Saint Joan of Arc   whose Catholic piety and orthodoxy are attested in numerous documents and who was executed by the English for what even the tribunal members later admitted were political reasons   was rewritten as a pagan martyr by Murray   2 2  Criticism  Ever since its first publication  Murray s theory has come under criticism for flaws in its use of evidence  with later historian Ronald Hutton remarking that it consisted of  a few well known works by Continental demonologists  a few tracts printed in England and quite a number of published records of Scottish witch trials  The much greater amount of unpublished evidence was absolutely ignored   Various critics  including historian Norman Cohn and folklorist Jacqueline Simpson  have highlighted what they see as Murray s  extreme selectivity  in choosing only sources that backed her argument  and ignoring those that did not  Regarding this  Jacqueline Simpson comments that   Murray s work involved her rationalizing many elements of the witch trials  particularly those she deemed impossible  such as the accounts of witches flying through the air or the Devil existing as a supernatural entity  However  Simpson criticised her for taking this rationalization too far in claiming that some of them are so ridiculous that they are  unintentionally funny   As evidence for this  Simpson highlights Murray s claim that trial accounts of Satan s cloven hoof were instead referring to  perhaps a specially formed boot or shoe  that the coven leader wore so that he could be recognized  Subsequent historians examining the Early Modern witch trials  particularly Carlo Ginzburg  Eva Pocs and Emma Wilby have also emphasised that the accounts in many of the witch trials represent visionary experiences  containing within them imaginary and surreal elements  which goes against Murray s rationalization of the trial accounts   Murray was also criticised by Simpson for her  passionate system building   developing her own image of a  rigidly codified and uniform  religious  system throughout Britain and Europe  that had its own set  Rites of initiation  dates for festivals  sabbath rituals  discipline and hierarchy within covens    2 3  Reception  2 3 1  1920 1962  As soon as Murray published her theory she received criticism from other historians who had studied the Early Modern witch trials  As later historian Ronald Hutton noted   Among that small number of scholars who were familiar with the trial records   Murray s theories  never had a chance  The use of source material which underpinned them was too blatantly flawed   In a 1922 review of The Witch Cult in Western Europe in the Folklore journal for instance  W B  Halliday  an expert on ancient religion  dismissed her theory  and noted that her hypothesis relied upon  documents torn from the background of their own age and divorced from the serious study of their historical antecedents   In a similar vein  C  L Estrange Ewen  a specialist in the witch trials  referred to them in 1938 as simple  fancies  that were nothing but  vapid balderdash   However  whilst a few historians chose to challenge her theories  most simply chose to ignore them as irrelevant  and as later folklorist and vocal critic of the theory Jacqueline Simpson noted   Normally this is an effective technique for ensuring the oblivion of bad books  but in this case it backfired  since it left her theory free to spread  seemingly unchallenged  among an eager public    Murray responded to much criticism by claiming that it was religiously motivated  coming from Christians who did not want her theories to be true  in one case she stated that her theory had received  a hostile reception from many strictly Christian sects and reviewers  but it made its way in spite of opposition   As Hutton noted  she had  a tendency to deny any good motives or virtues to those who criticized her theories   and  Her own reviews of  L Estrange Ewen  s work in the Folk Lore Society s periodical were amazingly ungracious  avoiding any engagement with his actual arguments or evidence and dismissing him completely in general terms as  unscientific    uncritical    dull   and so valueless and worthy only to be ignored    It was likely because few experts in the witch trials actually bothered to counter her arguments that many Britons  including several historians not familiar with the witch trials  simply assumed that Murray s view was the consensus as to the nature of European witchcraft  and included her ideas in their own works  For instance  the historian G C  Coulton  an expert on Mediaeval monasteries  included her theories in his work  Five Centuries of Religion  Volume One  1923   as did the novelist John Buchan  who included it into his Witch Wood  1927    In 1962  Canadian historian Elliot Rose published A Razor for a Goat  A Discussion of Certain Problems in Witchcraft and Diabolism  in which he provided one of the first popular history books to openly criticise Murray s interpretation  Later commenting on A Razor for a Goat  Richard Kieckhefer noted that when the book was first published  it was recognised as a biting critique of the views of Margaret Murray    Now  forty years later  Rose s book may perhaps seem more of a revisionist work within Murray s school of interpretation  So much has happened in the historiography of witchcraft that what seemed at first a wide gulf between Rose and Murray now seems narrower  and factors shared by the two have become clearer    2 3 2  1963–present  Following Murray s death  critics began to attack her theory more openly and voraciously  Norman Cohn  in his book Europe s Inner Demons  also accused Murray of falsifying her evidence by selectively quoting from the testimony of accused witches  deliberately leaving out fantastical elements to support her claim that real events were being described rather than fantasies  such elements include testimonies of flying to meetings  transforming into animals  or seeing the devil disappear and reappear suddenly  Jani Farrell Roberts has argued that Cohn is misrepresenting Murray  for she did indeed discuss such fantastical elements at length  and many of the supposedly omitted passages can be found in her books  Ronald Hutton is in agreement with Cohn  Carlo Ginzburg  on the other hand  regards Cohn s views as a polemic and believes that although Murray was too eager to accept all testimonies as accurate  and failed to critically differentiate those elements introduced by the interventions of judges  inquisitors and demonologists  she still had a  correct intuition  in identifying the remnants of a pre Christian  religion of Diana   and in believing that witch trial testimonies did at times represent actual or perceived experiences   In 1994  folklorist Jacqueline Simpson published an article in the Folklore journal entitled  Margaret Murray  Who Believed Her  and Why   in which she took a particularly critical approach to the Murrayite theory  explaining its faults  and looking at the history of the hypotheses  criticism  within it she remarked that  No British folklorist can remember Dr Margaret Murray without embarrassment   Similar criticism of Murray came from the historian Ronald Hutton  in both his 1991 book on ancient paganism  The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles  Their Nature and Legacy and in his 1999 study of Wiccan history  The Triumph of the Moon  A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft   3  Legacy  Murray is primarily known for her work in Egyptology  which represented  the core of her academic career   However  within archaeology  Murray was often thought of primarily as one of Petrie s assistants  with her work being overshadowed by his  By her retirement she had come to be highly regarded within the discipline  although Murray s reputation declined following her death  something that was probably due to the rejection of her witch cult theory and the general erasure of women archaeologists from the discipline s male dominated history   In 1935  UCL introduced the Margaret Murray Prize  awarded to the student who is deemed to have produced the best dissertation in Egyptology  it continued to be presented annually into the 21st century  In 1969  UCL named one of their common rooms in her honour  but it was converted into an office in 1989  UCL also hold two busts of Murray  one kept in the Petrie Museum and the other in the library of the UCL Institute of Archaeology  UCL also possess a watercolour painting of Murray by Winifred Brunton  formerly exhibited in the Petrie Gallery  it was later placed into the Art Collection stores  In 2013  on the 150th anniversary of Murray s birth and the 50th of her death  UCL Institute of Archaeology s Ruth Whitehouse described Murray as  a remarkable woman  whose life was  well worth celebrating  both in the archaeological world at large and especially in UCL    3 1  In Wicca and Paganism  Murray s Witch Cult theories would provide the blueprint for the Contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca   Murray s ideas proved highly influential over the ideas of Gerald Gardner  1884–1964   an English Wiccan who founded the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca in the 1950s before authoring the books Witchcraft Today  1954  and The Meaning of Witchcraft  1959   Gardner was the only member of the Folklore Society to  wholeheartedly  accept Murray s Witch Cult hypothesis   Prominent Wiccan Doreen Valiente described Murray as  a remarkable woman    3 2  In academia  In a 1994 academic paper  the folklorist Jacqueline Simpson noted that British folklorists remembered Murray with  embarrassment  and a  sense of paradox   Considering Murray s reputation to be  deservedly low  in academia  she argued that Murray s status as President of the Folklore Society had harmed the society s reputation and was a causal factor in the mistrustful attitude that many historians held toward folkloristics as an academic discipline   In a Folklore paper from 2003  Niall Finneran described Murray as  one of the greatest characters of post war British archaeology    4  Personal life  One of her friends  the antiquarian Hilda Davidson  who knew Murray in her old age  described her as being  not at all assertive     never thrust her ideas on anyone   In relation to her Witch Cult theory   She behaved in fact rather like someone who was a fully convinced member of some unusual religious sect  or perhaps  of the Freemasons  but never on any account got into arguments about it in public    Raised a devout Christian by her mother  Murray had initially become a Sunday School teacher in order to preach the faith  However  after entering the academic profession she rejected religion  gaining a reputation amongst other members of the Folklore Society as a noted sceptic and a rationalist  Despite her rejection of religion  she continued to maintain a personal belief in a God of some sort  relating in her autobiography that she believed in  an unseen over ruling Power    which science calls Nature and religion calls God   She was also a believer and a practitioner of magic  performing curses against those whom she felt deserved it  as Ronald Hutton noted   Once she carried out a ritual to blast a fellow academic whose promotion she believed to have been undeserved  by mixing up ingredients in a frying pan in the presence of two colleagues  The victim actually did become ill  and had to change jobs  This was only one among a number of such acts of malevolent magic she perpetrates  and which the friend who recorded them assumed  rather nervously  were pranks  with coincidental effects    5  Bibliography  6  References  6 1  Footnotes  6 2  Bibliography  7  External links  7 1  Books   text in HTML and
