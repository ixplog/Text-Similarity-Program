The politics of Nepal function within a framework of a republic with a multi party system  Currently  the position of President  head of state  is occupied by Dr  Ram Baran Yadav  The position of Prime Minister  head of government  is held by Sushil Koirala  Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and his cabinet  while legislative power is vested in the Constituent Assembly   Until May 28  2008  Nepal was a constitutional monarchy  On that date  the constitution was altered by the Constituent Assembly to make the country a republic   1  Political conditions  1 1  1990–1996  Parliamentary monarchy  Until 1990  Nepal was a constitutional monarchy running under the executive control of the king  Faced with a people s movement against the absolute monarchy  King Birendra  in 1990  agreed to large scale political reforms by creating a parliamentary monarchy with the king as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of the government   Nepal s legislature was bicameral consisting of a House of Representatives and a National Council  The House of Representatives consisted of 205 members directly elected by the people  The National Council had 60 members  10 nominated by the king  35 elected by the House of Representatives and the remaining 15 elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns  The legislature had a five year term  but was dissolved by the king before its term could end  All Nepalese citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote   The executive comprised the King and the Council of Ministers  the Cabinet   The leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the Prime Minister  The Cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Prime Minister   Governments in Nepal have tended to be highly unstable  no government has survived for more than two years since 1991  either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch   In the first free and fair elections in Nepal in 1991  the Nepali Congress was victorious   The 1994 election defeat of the Nepali Congress Party by the Communist Party of Nepal  Unified Marxist Leninist   CPN UML   made Nepal the first communist led monarchy in Asia  with Man Mohan Adhikary prime minister  In mid 1994  parliament was dissolved due to dissension within the Nepali Congress Party  The subsequent general election  held 15 November 1994  gave no party a majority and led to several years of unstable coalition governments  As of the May 1999 general elections  the Nepali Congress Party once again headed a majority government  There have been three Nepali Congress Party Prime Ministers since the 1999 elections  K P  Bhattarai  31 May 1999 – 17 March 2000   Girija Prasad Koirala  20 March 2000 – 19 July 2001   and Sher Bahadur Deuba  23 July 2001 – 2003   The final distribution of seats in Parliament gave the Nepali Congress 113  the CPN UML  69  the RPP 11  the RJM 5  the NSP 5  the Workers and Peasants Party 1  and the United People s Front 1  Nepali Congress Party has divided to Nepali Congress Party led by G  P  Koirala and Nepali Congress  Democratic  led by Sher Bahadur Deuba  Amongst the elected MPs  39 MPs belong to Nepali Congress  Democratic   Former Prime Minister and Influential Leader Krishna Prasad Bhattarai has expressed his support for Nepali Congress  Democratic   Both Congress parties regard Krishna Prasad Bhattarai as their main leader   1 2  1996  Maoist insurgency  In February 1996  the Communist Party of Nepal  Maoist  began a violent insurgency in more than 50 of the country s 75 districts  About 13 000 police  civilians  and insurgents have been killed in the conflict since 1996  In July 2001 Prime Minister Deuba announced a cease fire  which the Maoists pledged to observe  as part of a government effort to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict  Although Maoist instigated intimidation and extortion continue  the killings have largely subsided since the cease fire was announced  The government and Maoists held talks in August and September 2001   Political parties agreed in 1991 that the monarchy would remain to enhance political stability and provide an important symbol of national identity for the culturally diverse Nepali people  The King exercises limited powers  including the right to declare a state of emergency in the event of war or armed revolt  with the advice and consent of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister  According to the constitution  the King s declaration of a state of emergency must be approved by a two thirds majority of the lower house of the Parliament   1 3  2001  Royal massacre  On June 1  2001  Crown Prince Dipendra was officially reported to have shot and killed his father  King Birendra  his mother  Queen Aishwarya  his brother  his sister  his father s younger brother  Prince Dhirendra  and several aunts  before turning the gun on himself  Although he never regained consciousness before dying  Crown Prince Dipendra was nonetheless the king under the law of Nepalese royal succession  After his death two days later  the late King s surviving brother Gyanendra was proclaimed king   1 4  2005–2007  Suspension of parliament and Loktantra Andolan  On 1 February 2005 King Gyanendra suspended the Parliament  appointed a government led by himself  and enforced martial law  The King argued that civil politicians were unfit to handle the Maoist insurgency  Telephone lines were cut and several high profile political leaders were detained  Other opposition leaders fled to India and regrouped there  A broad coalition called the Seven Party Alliance  SPA  was formed in opposition to the royal takeover  encompassing the seven parliamentary parties who held about 90% of the seats in the old  dissolved parliament   The UN OHCHR  in response to events in Nepal  set up a monitoring program in 2005 to assess and observe the human rights situation there  On 22 November 2005  the Seven Party Alliance  SPA  of parliamentary parties and the Communist Party of Nepal  Maoist  agreed on a historic and unprecedented 12 point memorandum of understanding  MOU  for peace and democracy  Nepalese from various walks of life and the international community regarded the MOU as an appropriate political response to the crisis that was developing in Nepal  Against the backdrop of the historical sufferings of the Nepalese people and the enormous human cost of the last ten years of violent conflict  the MOU  which proposes a peaceful transition through an elected constituent assembly  created an acceptable formula for a united movement for democracy  As per the 12 point MOU  the SPA called for a protest movement  and the Communist Party of Nepal  Maoist  supported it  This led to a countrywide uprising called the Loktantra Andolan that started in April 2006  All political forces including civil society and professional organizations actively galvanized the people  This resulted in massive and spontaneous demonstrations and rallies held across Nepal against King Gyanendra s autocratic rule   The people s participation was so broad  momentous and pervasive that the king feared being overthrown  On 21 April 2006  King Gyanendra declared that  power would be returned to the people   This had little effect on the people  who continued to occupy the streets of Kathmandu and other towns  openly defying the daytime curfew  Finally King Gyanendra announced the reinstatement the House of Representatives  thereby conceding one of the major demands of the SPA  at midnight on 24 April 2006  Following this action the coalition of political forces decided to call off the protests   Twenty one people died and thousands were injured during the 19 days of protests   On 19 May 2006  the parliament assumed total legislative power and gave executive power to the Government of Nepal  previously known as His Majesty s Government   Names of many institutions  including the army  were stripped of the  royal  adjective and the Raj Parishad  a council of the King s advisers  was abolished  with his duties assigned to the Parliament itself  The activities of the King became subject to parliamentary scrutiny and the King s properties were subjected to taxation  Moreover  Nepal was declared a secular state abrogating the previous status of a Hindu Kingdom  However  most of the changes have  as yet  not been implemented  On 19 July 2006  the prime minister  G  P  Koirala  sent a letter to the United Nations announcing the intention of the Nepalese government to hold elections to a constituent assembly by April 2007   1 5  December 2007 to May 2008  Abolition of the monarchy  On 23 December 2007  an agreement was made for the monarchy to be abolished and the country to become a federal republic with the Prime Minister becoming head of state  Defying political pundits  who had predicted it to be trounced in the April 2008 elections  the Communist Party of Nepal  Maoist  became the largest party amidst a general atmosphere of fear and intimidation from all sides  A federal republic was established in May 2008  with only four members of the 601 seat Constituent Assembly voting against the change  which ended 240 years of royal rule in Nepal  The government announced a public holiday for three days   May 28—May 30   to celebrate the country becoming a federal republic   1 6  Since 2008  Major parties such as the Unified Communist Party of Nepal  Maoist   Communist Party of Nepal  Unified Marxist Leninist   CPN UML  and the Nepali Congress agreed to write a constitution to replace the interim one within 2 years  However  uncooperative and  selfish  behavior of the political parties has been cited as the major cause behind the de railing of the peace process   The Maoists  as the largest party of the country  took power right after the elections and named Pushpa Kamal Dahal  Prachanda  as the Prime Minister of the country  CPN UML also joined this government  but the Nepali Congress took the part of the main opposition party  People soon saw that the country s situation deteriorated and political turmoils were in store  Prachanda soon fell into a dispute with the then army chief Rookmangud Katwal and decided to sack him  But the President Ram Baran Yadav  as the supreme head of military power in the country  revoked this decision and gave the army chief additional time in office  An angry Prachanda and his party quit the government  majorly citing this reason and decided to operate as the main opposition to the government headed by CPN UML and its co partner Nepali Congress afterwards  Madhav Kumar Nepal was named the Prime Minister   The Maoists have been to this date demanding civilian supremacy over the army   The Maoists have been forcing closures   commonly known as bandhs   in the country  and have also declared autonomous states for almost all the ethnic groups in Nepal   seen as a part of revenge against the action that foiled their decision to sack the army chief   Political leaders continue to discuss plans to end this turmoil  but none of the talks have been successful  Rising inflation  economic downturn  poverty  insecurity and uncertainty are the major problems  Many analysts opine that freedom has brought anarchy to the country  Many doubt that the political parties will succeed in writing a constitution   On May 2012 constitution assembly was dissolved and another election to select the constitution assembly members was declared by Dr  Baburam Bhattarai   1 6 1  Environmental policy  As a mountainous country with agriculture  hydropower and tourism all important for its economy  Nepal is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change  such as rising temperatures  erratic rainfall patterns and incidents of drought  According to the Climate & Development Knowledge Network  this has prompted the government to introduce new initiatives and institutional reforms   2  Legislative branch  2 1  Pre 2006  From 1991 to 2002 the Parliament  Sansad  had two chambers  The House of Representatives  Pratinidhi Sabha  had 205 members elected for five year term in single seat constituencies  The National Council  Rashtriya Sabha  had 60 members  35 members elected by the Pratinidhi Sabha  15 representatives of Regional Development Areas and 10 members appointed by the king  Parliament was subsequently dissolved by the king in 2002 on the pretext that it was incapable of handling the Maoists rebels   2 2  From Loktantra Andolan to the Constituent Assembly  After the victory of Loktantra Andolan in the spring of 2006  a unicameral interim legislature replaced the previous parliament  The new body consists both of members of the old parliament as well as nominated members  As of December 2007  the legislature had the following composition   2 3  The first elections after becoming a Republic  the Constituent Assembly  In May 2008 the first democratic elections made the Communist Party of Nepal the largest party in the Constituent Assembly  which will have a term of two years   3  Judicial branch  The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court  Sarbochha Adalat   appellate courts  and various Trial court district courts  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was appointed by the monarch on recommendation of the Constitutional Council  the other judges were appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the Judicial Council   Nepal s judiciary is legally separate from the executive and legislative branches and has increasingly shown the will to be independent of political influence  The judiciary has the right of judicial review under the constitution   4
