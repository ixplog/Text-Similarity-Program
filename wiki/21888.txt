The National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST   known between 1901 and 1988 as the National Bureau of Standards  NBS   is a measurement standards laboratory  also known as a National Metrological Institute  NMI   which is a non regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce  The institute s official mission is to   NIST had an operating budget for fiscal year 2007  October 1  2006 September 30  2007  of about $843 3 million  NIST s 2009 budget was $992 million  and it also received $610 million as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  NIST employs about 2 900 scientists  engineers  technicians  and support and administrative personnel  About 1 800 NIST associates  guest researchers and engineers from American companies and foreign countries  complement the staff  In addition  NIST partners with 1 400 manufacturing specialists and staff at nearly 350 affiliated centers around the country  NIST publishes the Handbook 44 that provides the  Specifications  tolerances  and other technical requirements for weighing and measuring devices    1  History  1 1  Initial mandate  In 1821 John Quincy Adams stated   Weights and measures may be ranked among the necessities of life to every individual of human society   but this had long been understood  The Articles of Confederation  ratified by the colonies in 1781  contained the clause   The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck by their own authority  or by that of the respective states—fixing the standards of weights and measures throughout the United States   Article 1  section 8  of the Constitution of the United States  1789   transferred this power to Congress   The Congress shall have power   To coin money  regulate the value thereof  and of foreign coin  and fix the standard of weights and measures    In January 1790 President Washington  in his first annual message to Congress stated that   Uniformity in the currency  weights  and measures of the United States is an object of great importance  and will  I am persuaded  be duly attended to   and ordered Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson to prepare a plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage  Weights  and Measures of the United States  afterwards referred to as the Jefferson report  On October 25  1791  Washington appealed a third time to Congress   A uniformity of the weights and measures of the country is among the important objects submitted to you by the Constitution and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and universal  must be no less honorable to the public council than conducive to the public convenience   but it was not until 1838 that a uniform set of standards was worked out   1 2  History  From 1830 until 1901  the role of overseeing weights and measures was carried out by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures  which was part of the U S  Treasury Department  In 1901  in response to a bill proposed by Congressman James H  Southard  R  Ohio   the National Bureau of Standards was founded with the mandate to provide standard weights and measures  and to serve as the national physical laboratory for the United States   Southard had previously sponsored a bill for metric conversion of the United States   President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Samuel W  Stratton as the first director  The budget for the first year of operation was $40 000  The Bureau took custody of the copies of the kilogram and meter bars that were the standards for U S  measures  and set up a program to provide metrology services for United States scientific and commercial users  A laboratory site was constructed in Washington  D C   and instruments were acquired from the national physical laboratories of Europe  In addition to weights and measures  the Bureau developed instruments for electrical units and for measurement of light  In 1905 a meeting was called that would be the first  National Conference on Weights and Measures    Initially conceived as purely a metrology agency  the Bureau of Standards was directed by Herbert Hoover to set up divisions to develop commercial standards for materials and products page 133 Some of these standards were for products intended for government use  but product standards also affected private sector consumption  Quality standards were developed for products including some types of clothing  automobile brake systems and headlamps  antifreeze  and electrical safety  During World War I  the Bureau worked on multiple problems related to war production  even operating its own facility to produce optical glass when European supplies were cut off  Between the wars  Harry Diamond of the Bureau developed a blind approach radio aircraft landing system  During the Second World War  military research and development was carried out  including development of radio propagation forecast methods  the proximity fuze and the guided bomb   In 1948  financed by the Air Force  the Bureau began design and construction of SEAC  the Standards Eastern Automatic Computer  The computer went into operation in May 1950 using a combination of vacuum tubes and solid state diode logic  About the same time the Standards Western Automatic Computer  was built at the Los Angeles office of the NBS and used for research there  A mobile version  DYSEAC  was built for the Signal Corps in 1954   The  National Bureau of Standards  became the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 1988   1 3  Metric system  The Congress of 1866 legalized the use of the metric system through the passage of U S  code 1952 Ed   Title 15  Ch 6  sections 204 and 205  On May 20  1875  17 out of 20 countries signed a document known as the Metric Convention or the Treaty of the Meter  which established the International Bureau of Weights and Measures under the control of an international committee elected by the General Conference on Weights and Measures   2  Organization  NIST is headquartered in Gaithersburg  Maryland  and operates a facility in Boulder  Colorado  NIST s activities are organized into laboratory programs and extramural programs  Effective October 1  2010  NIST was realigned by reducing the number of NIST laboratory units from ten to six  NIST Laboratories include    CNST    EL    ITL    NCNR    MML    PML  Extramural programs include     a nationwide network of centers to assist small and mid sized manufacturers to create and retain jobs  improve efficiencies  and minimize waste through process improvements and to increase market penetration with innovation and growth strategies   Technology Innovation Program  TIP   a grant program where NIST and industry partners cost share the early stage development of innovative but high risk technologies   Baldrige Performance Excellence Program  which administers the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award  the nation s highest award for performance and business excellence  NIST s Boulder laboratories are best known for NIST‑F1  which houses an atomic clock  NIST‑F1 serves as the source of the nation s official time  From its measurement of the natural resonance frequency of caesium舒which defines the second舒NIST broadcasts time signals via longwave radio station WWVB near Fort Collins  Colorado  and shortwave radio stations WWV and WWVH  located near Fort Collins and Kekaha  Hawaii  respectively   NIST also operates a neutron science user facility  the NIST Center for Neutron Research  NCNR   The NCNR provides scientists access to a variety of neutron scattering instruments  which they use in many research fields  materials science  fuel cells  biotechnology  etc     The SURF III Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility is a source of synchrotron radiation  in continuous operation since 1961  SURF III now serves as the U S  national standard for source based radiometry throughout the generalized optical spectrum  All NASA borne  extreme ultraviolet observation instruments have been calibrated at SURF since the 1970s  and SURF is used for measurement and characterization of systems for extreme ultraviolet lithography   The performs research in nanotechnology  both through internal research efforts and by running a user accessible cleanroom nanomanufacturing facility  This  NanoFab  is equipped with tools for lithographic patterning and imaging  e g   electron microscopes and atomic force microscopes    2 1  Committees  NIST has seven standing committees   Technical Guidelines Development Committee  TGDC   Advisory Committee on Earthquake Hazards Reduction  ACEHR   National Construction Safety Team Advisory Committee  NCST Advisory Committee   Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board  ISPAB    VCAT   Baldrige National Quality Program Board of Overseers  BNQP Board of Overseers   Manufacturing Extension Partnership National Advisory Board  MEPNAB   3  Projects  3 1  Measurements and standards  As part of its mission  NIST supplies industry  academia  government  and other users with over 1 300  SRMs   These artifacts are certified as having specific characteristics or component content  used as calibration standards for measuring equipment and procedures  quality control benchmarks for industrial processes  and experimental control samples   3 2  Handbook 44  NIST publishes the Handbook 44 each year after the annual meeting of the National Conference on Weights and Measures  NCWM   Each edition is developed through cooperation of the Committee on Specifications and Tolerances of the NCWM and the Weights and Measures Division  WMD  of the NIST  The purpose of the book is a partial fulfillment of the statutory responsibility for  cooperation with the states in securing uniformity of weights and measures laws and methods of inspection    NIST has been publishing various forms of what is now the Handbook 44 since 1918 and began publication under the current name in 1949  The 2010 edition conforms to the concept of the primary use of the SI  metric  measurements recommended by the Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988   3 3  Homeland security  NIST is currently developing government wide identification card standards for federal employees and contractors to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to government buildings and computer systems   3 4  World Trade Center Collapse Investigation  In 2002 the National Construction Safety Team Act mandated NIST to conduct an investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings 1 and 2 and the 47 story 7 World Trade Center  The  World Trade Center Collapse Investigation   directed by lead investigator Shyam Sunder  covered three aspects  including a technical building and fire safety investigation to study the factors contributing to the probable cause of the collapses of the WTC Towers  WTC 1 and 2  and WTC 7  NIST also established a research and development program to provide the technical basis for improved building and fire codes  standards  and practices  and a dissemination and technical assistance program to engage leaders of the construction and building community in implementing proposed changes to practices  standards  and codes  NIST also is providing practical guidance and tools to better prepare facility owners  contractors  architects  engineers  emergency responders  and regulatory authorities to respond to future disasters  The investigation portion of the response plan was completed with the release of the final report on 7 World Trade Center on November 20  2008  The final report on the WTC Towers—including 30 recommendations for improving building and occupant safety—was released on October 26  2005   3 5  Election technology  NIST works in conjunction with the Technical Guidelines Development Committee of the Election Assistance Commission to develop the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines for voting machines and other election technology   4  People  Four scientific researchers at NIST have been awarded Nobel Prizes for work in physics  William D  Phillips in 1997  Eric A  Cornell in 2001  John L  Hall in 2005 and David J  Wineland in 2012  which is the largest number for any U S  government laboratory  All four were recognized for their work

Guardian and the New York Times reported that NIST allowed the National Security Agency  NSA  to insert a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator called Dual EC DRBG into NIST standard SP 800 90 that had a backdoor that the NSA can use to covertly decrypt material that was encrypted using this pseudorandom number generator  Both papers report that the NSA worked covertly to get its own version of SP 800 90 approved for worldwide use in 2006  The leaked document states that  eventually  NSA became the sole editor   The reports confirm suspicions and technical grounds publicly raised by cryptographers in 2007 that the EC DRBG could contain an asymmetric backdoor  perhaps placed in the standard by NSA    NIST responded to the allegations  stating that  NIST works to publish the strongest cryptographic standards possible  and that it uses  a transparent  public process to rigorously vet our recommended standards   The agency stated that  there has been some confusion about the standards development process and the role of different organizations in it   The National Security Agency  NSA  participates in the NIST cryptography process because of its recognized expertise  NIST is also required by statute to consult with the NSA   Recognizing the concerns expressed  the agency reopened the public comment period for the SP800 90 publications  promising that  if vulnerabilities are found in these or any other NIST standards  we will work with the cryptographic community to address them as quickly as possible”   7  See also  Title 15 of the Code of Federal
