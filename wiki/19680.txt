compete in go kart races  controlling one of a selection of characters from the Mario franchise  Up to twelve characters can compete in each race depending on which installment in the series   One of

race and the top three players with the most points overall will receive a trophy   Time Trial – The player races alone in order to finish any course in the fastest time possible  The best time is then saved as a ghost  which the player can compete against in later trials   VS – Multiple human players race against each other on any course with customized rules such as team racing and item
