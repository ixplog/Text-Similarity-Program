Rungholt was a wealthy city in Nordfriesland  in the Danish duchy of Schleswig  It sank beneath the waves when a storm tide  the first  Grote Mandrenke   in the North Sea tore through the area on January 16  1362   Rungholt was situated on the island of Strand  which was rent asunder by another storm tide in 1634  and of which the islets of Pellworm  Nordstrand and Nordstrandischmoor are the only remaining fragments   Relics of the city were being found in the Wadden Sea until the late 20th century  but shifting sediments have carried the last of these into the sea  In the 1920s and 1930s  some remains of the city were exposed  they suggested a population of at least 1 500 to 2 000  which is fairly large for that region and time  and it is likely that Rungholt was a major port  Legend has greatly exaggerated its size and wealth  however   Impressed by the fate of the city  the relics  and not least legend s excessive descriptions  the German poet Detlev von Liliencron wrote a popular poem called  Trutz  Blanke Hans  about this lost city which starts with the words   Heut bin ich Ã¼ber Rungholt gefahren  die Stadt ging unter vor sechshundert Jahren     Today I traveled over Rungholt  the city sank 600 years ago     Local myth has it that one can still hear the church bells of Rungholt ringing when sailing through the area on a stormy night   1  See also  Lost city  Dunwich and Ravenser Odd  2  External links
