The Wu Tang Clan is an American hip hop group from New York City  originally composed of East Coast rappers RZA  GZA  Method Man  Raekwon  Ghostface Killah  Inspectah Deck  U God  Masta Killa  and the late Ol  Dirty Bastard  The group was formed in and is associated with the New York City borough of Staten Island  referred to by members as  Shaolin     They have introduced and launched the careers of a number of affiliated artists and groups  often collectively known as the Wu Tang Killa Bees  and in 2008  About com ranked them the No  1 greatest hip hop group of all time  Kris Ex of Rolling Stone called Wu Tang Clan  the best rap group ever   In 2004  NME hailed them as one of the most influential groups of the last ten years   1  History  1 1  Foundation and name  The Wu Tang Clan was assembled in the early 1990s with RZA as the de facto leader and the group s producer  RZA and Ol  Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after the film Shaolin and Wu Tang  The group s debut album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs  Wu Tang theme  dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu Tang sections   The group developed backronyms for the name  as hip hop pioneers such as KRS One and Big Daddy Kane did with their names   including  We Usually Take All Niggas  Garments    Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game   and  Wisdom of the Universe  and the Truth of Allah for the Nation of the Gods    1 2  1992–96  Enter the Wu Tang  36 Chambers  and solo albums  The Wu Tang Clan first became known in 1993 following the release of the independent single  Protect Ya Neck   which immediately gave the group a sizable underground following  especially after their tour with Kat Nu and Cypress Hill  Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign the Wu Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels  Loud RCA finally agreed  releasing their debut album  Enter the Wu Tang  36 Chambers   in November 1993  This album turned out to be critically acclaimed  and to date is regarded as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time  The success of Enter the Wu Tang  36 Chambers established the group as a creative and influential force in mid 1990s hip hop  allowing Ol  Dirty Bastard  GZA  RZA  Raekwon  U God  Method Man  and Ghostface Killah to negotiate solo contracts  RZA spoke on the Wu Tang Clan s unorthodox business model   RZA was the first to follow up on the success of Enter the Wu Tang with a side project  founding the Gravediggaz with Prince Paul and Frukwan  both of Stetsasonic  and Poetic  The Gravediggaz released 6 Feet Deep in August 1994  which became one of the best known works to emerge from hip hop s small subgenre of horrorcore   It had always been planned for Method Man to be the first breakout star from the group s lineup  with the b side of the first single being his now classic eponymous solo track  In November 1994 his solo album Tical was released  It was entirely produced by RZA  who for the most part continued with the grimy  raw textures he explored on 36 Chambers  RZA s hands on approach to Tical extended beyond his merely creating the beats to devising song concepts and structures  The track  All I Need  from Tical was the winner of the  Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group  at the 1995 Grammy Awards   After the release of Method Man s Tical  Ol  Dirty Bastard was the next member to launch a solo career  His debut album Return to the 36 Chambers  The Dirty Version was released in March 1995  and is considered a hip hop classic   Late summer  and early fall of 1995 saw the release of Raekwon s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx     and GZA s Liquid Swords  which would turn out to be the group s two most significant and well received solo projects  Cuban Linx was a diverse  theatrical criminological epic that saw RZA move away from the raw  stripped down beats of the early albums and towards a richer  cinematic sound more reliant on strings and classic soul samples  The album is highly notable in that it revived  and expanded the Mafioso rap subgenre  which started to decline several years beforehand  Lavish living and the crime underworld are referenced throughout using quotes from the John Woo movie The Killer  with the mystique of the Wu Tang Clan deepened by the adoption of crime boss aliases and the crew name Wu Gambinos  The album introduced a flurry of slang words to the rap lexicon  and many artists have gone on to imitate its materialism  Cuban Linx featured all but one Wu member  and featured the debut from Cappadonna  The album also featured rapper Nas  who was the first non Wu Tang affiliated MC to appear on a Wu Tang Clan album  GZA s Liquid Swords had a similar focus on inner city criminology akin to Only Built 4 Cuban Linx  but it was far darker  both in GZA s grim lyrics and in the ominous  foreboding production that saw RZA experimenting more with keyboards than ever before  Liquid Swords features guest appearances from every Wu Tang Clan member  and is linked together by excerpts from the movie Shogun Assassin  1995 also saw the release of the Wu Wear clothing line  which would turn out to be massively successful  and influential on hip hop culture  It initially started as a mere way to make money from the demand for bootleg Wu Tang Clan shirts  and evolved into an extensive collection of designer garments  Soon  other hip hop artists were making similar ventures and by the mid 2000s  a clothing line was almost a prerequisite for hip hop superstardom  with clothing lines launched by Puff Daddy  Jay Z  Busta Rhymes  Nelly  Ludacris  50 Cent  and more   Almost a year after the release of Liquid Swords  Ghostface Killah released his first solo album  Ironman in late October 1996  The album struck a balance between the sinister keyboard laden textures of Liquid Swords and the sentimental soul samples of Cuban Linx  while Ghostface himself explored new territory as a lyricist  Ironman was critically acclaimed and is still widely considered to be one of the best of Wu Tang solo albums  Although the 1994–1996 albums were released as solo  RZA s presence behind the production  and the large number of guest appearances from other Wu Tang Clan members has rendered them to be mostly all round group efforts   In 1996  the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization s compilation CD  America Is Dying Slowly  alongside Biz Markie  Coolio  and Fat Joe  among many other prominent hip hop artists  The CD  meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men  was heralded as  a masterpiece  by The Source magazine   1 3  1997–2000  Wu Tang Forever  diversification and second string of solo albums  With their solo careers firmly established  the Wu Tang Clan reassembled to release the highly anticipated Grammy nominated multiplatinum double album Wu Tang Forever in June 1997  debuting at number one on the Billboard Charts  This event was featured in a CNN roundup for the extraordinary sales the group achieved without a mainstream sound or commercial appeal  The album s first single   Triumph   was over five minutes long  featured nine verses  one from each member plus Cappadonna and excluding ODB who appeared on the intro and bridge   and no hook or a repeated phrase  The sound of the album built significantly on the previous three solo albums  with RZA using more keyboards and string samples  as well as  for the first time  assigning some of the album s production to his protégés True Master and 4th Disciple  The group s lyrics differed significantly from those of 36 Chambers  with many verses written in a dense stream of consciousness form heavily influenced by the teachings of the Five Percent Nation  According to Nielsen SoundScan  the album has sold over 8 3 million copies to date worldwide   Wu Tang Forever also marked the end of RZA s  five year plan   After    Forever s success  RZA ceased to oversee all aspects of Wu Tang product as he had done previously  delegating much of his existing role to associates such as Oliver  Power  Grant and his brother Mitchell  Divine  Diggs  This move was designed to expand Wu Tang s reach in the industry and take advantage of financial opportunities for the group  In keeping with this move  an array of Wu Tang products  both musical and otherwise  were to be released over the next two years   Following Wu Tang Forever  the focus of the Wu Tang empire largely shifted to the promoting of emerging affiliated artists  The group s close associate Cappadonna followed the group project with March 1998 s The Pillage  Soon after  Killah Priest  another close associate of the Clan  released Heavy Mental to great critical acclaim  Affiliated groups Sunz of Man and Killarmy also released well received albums  followed by Wu Tang Killa Bees  The Swarm—a compilation album showcasing these and more Wu affiliated artists  and including new solo tracks from the group members themselves  The Swarm sold well and was certified gold   There was also a long line of releases from secondary affiliates such as Popa Wu  Shyheim  GP Wu  and Wu Syndicate  Second albums from Gravediggaz and Killarmy  as well as a greatest hits album and a b sides compilation also eventually saw release   While this round was commercially successful  it was not as critically acclaimed as its predecessor  The second round of solo albums from Wu Tang saw second efforts from the five members who had already released albums  as well as debuts from all the remaining members  with the exception of Masta Killa  In the space of two years  RZA s Bobby Digital In Stereo  Method Man Tical 2000  Judgement Day and Blackout   with Redman   GZA s Beneath the Surface  Ol  Dirty Bastard s Nigga Please  U God s Golden Arms Redemption  Raekwon s Immobilarity  Ghostface Killah s Supreme Clientele and Inspectah Deck s Uncontrolled Substance were all released  seven of them being released in the space of seven months between June 1999 and January 2000   RZA also composed the score for the film Ghost Dog  The Way of the Samurai  directed by Jim Jarmusch  while he and other Wu Tang members contributed music to a companion  music inspired by the film  album   The avalanche of Wu Tang product between 1997 and 2000 was considered by some critics to have resulted in an oversaturation that was responsible for Wu Tang s decline in popularity  or at least in critical regard during that time period  Reviews such as Melody Maker s writeup on Ghostface Killah s Supreme Clientele in January 2000 which began  Another month  another Wu Tang side project  revealed critics  exhaustion at the Clan s prodigious output  The overall reception for the second round of Clan member solo albums was decidedly mixed if largely positive  and they did not live up to their pre    Forever forebears critically   Occasional albums would still receive critical acclaim  Ghostface Killah s Supreme Clientele being one of them  is regarded as one of the best solo efforts from the Clan  while Method Man and ODB remained popular in their own right as solo artists  and Wu Tang remained as a well known force  but they had seemingly lost the ability to excite the music world in the way they had throughout the earlier  and mid 1990s  Many fans and critics also bemoaned the lack of RZA s input on the post    Forever solo albums  which were mostly produced by the Wu Element producers  other lower ranking affiliates  or by outside producers such as the Trackmasters or the Neptunes   1 4  2000–01  The W  Iron Flag and New Millennium  The group reconvened once again to make The W  though without Ol  Dirty Bastard  who was at the time incarcerated in California for violating the terms of his probation  Though incarcerated  ODB managed to make it onto the track  Conditioner  which featured Snoop Dogg  ODB s vocals were recorded via the telephones used for inmates to talk with visitors  while in prison  The W was mostly well received by critics  particularly for The RZA s production  and also gave the group a hit single with the uptempo  Gravel Pit   part of a trilogy of videos where the group would visit different eras with a time traveling elevator  which also included  Protect Ya Neck  The Jump Off   and  Careful  Click  Click    which were then followed by  I Can t Go to Sleep  featuring Isaac Hayes  The album would go on to reach double platinum status   Shortly before the release of The W  ODB escaped custody while being transported from a rehab center to a Los Angeles court and was considered a fugitive  At a record release party for The W  ODB appeared with his face hidden by an orange parka  and was not recognized until introduced to the crowd  With police officers present outside  ODB performed briefly and then fled  fearing capture  Six days later ODB caused a commotion  signing autographs in a McDonald s at Broad & Girard Street in North Philadelphia  Unaware of who was causing the commotion  the manager called the police  When the law arrived  ODB mistook them for fans until they drew their guns  ODB fled the facility  but was stopped while trying to start his vehicle  After presenting a fake ID  he admitted his real identity  and was arrested   In 2001  the Wu Tang Clan released Iron Flag  an album which made extensive use of outside producers and guests  Its crossover vibe and features  including Ron Isley  Flavor Flav  and prominent producers Trackmasters  marked it as a lighter fare  while critically praised  it gained a less than stellar reputation with fans  Group member Ghostface Killah would later denounce the record   While originally featured on the cover of Iron Flag  Cappadonna was airbrushed out of the artwork and absent from the album entirely  This may be related to tension that arose within the group when it was revealed that Cappadonna s manager was  or had been  a police informant  a revelation that also brought on the manager s subsequent firing  Cappadonna would however  continue collaborating and touring with the group in the upcoming years   Around this time Method Man began his acting career  along with close collaborator Redman  by starring in the stoner comedy film How High   1 5  2004  Legal issues  death of Ol  Dirty Bastard and resurgence  In early 2004  U God apparently left the group in disgust  A DVD titled Rise of a Fallen Soldier was released detailing his problems  which were mostly with his treatment by RZA  who he claimed had hindered his success as a solo artist  He formed a group of young protegés called the Hillside Scramblers with whom he released the album U Godzilla Presents the Hillside Scramblers in March 2004  The dispute culminated in a heated phone conversation between RZA and U God on live radio  which ultimately saw the two reconcile  He has since returned to the group   2004 saw the unexpected return of the Clan to the live stage  They embarked on a short European tour before coming together as a complete group for the first time in several years to headline the Rock the Bells festival in California  The concert was released on CD under the name Disciples of the 36 Chambers  Chapter 1  and they also released a music video greatest hits album  Legend of the Wu Tang Clan   1 5 1  Death of Ol  Dirty Bastard  Ol  Dirty Bastard s career in Wu Tang was marked by erratic behavior  At the 1998 Grammy Awards  he protested the Clan s loss  in Best Rap Album  by interrupting Puff Daddy s acceptance speech for his Song of the Year award  In addition  ODB s run ins with the law were well publicized—he was arrested several times for offenses including assault  shoplifting  wearing body armor after being convicted of a felony  and possession of cocaine  and he missed multiple court dates  In late 2000  Ol  Dirty Bastard unexpectedly escaped near the end of his rehab sentence  spending one month on the run as a fugitive before showing up on stage at the record release party for The W in New York City  He managed to escape the club but was later captured by police in Philadelphia and sent to New York to face charges of cocaine possession  In April 2001  he was sentenced to two to four years in prison  Once released from prison  he signed a one million dollar contract with Roc a Fella Records   On November 13  2004  ODB collapsed at Wu Tang s recording studio  36 Chambers on West 34th Street in New York City  and was pronounced dead later that night  Wu Tang paid him homage a number of times  in August 2006  one of his sons came out at a Wu Tang concert at Webster Hall and rapped  Brooklyn Zoo   along with his mother  and during a concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom the Clan brought his mother out on stage for a sing along to  Shimmy Shimmy Ya    1 6  2006–10  Fourth round of solo albums and 8 Diagrams  2005 saw the release of RZA s first book  The Wu Tang Manual  the release of U God s second album  Mr  Xcitement and the long awaited collaboration between GZA and producer DJ Muggs  entitled Grandmasters  The collaborative record received good reviews and played fairly well with fans  who by and large had been waiting to see the Wu step up the quality of their releases   On March 28  2006  Ghostface Killah released the street rap oriented Fishscale  to much critical acclaim and some commercial success  The entire Clan  including Cappadonna and the deceased ODB  appeared on the track  9 Milli Bros   The album also offered an expansion of Ghostface s traditional sound—precipitated by the moderately successful club song  Be Easy  and battle rhymes in the Just Blaze produced  The Champ   After its reception from fans  label Def Jam asked Ghost to release another album that year  the result  More Fish  excited fans and critics somewhat less   On June 25  2006  Inspectah Deck released a street album entitled The Resident Patient  a prelude to his upcoming album  titled The Rebellion  which is said to be his final solo album  Late summer of 2006 saw the release of Masta Killa s second studio album  Made in Brooklyn  to lukewarm reviews  as well as Method Man s 4 21    the Day After  on which the rapper endeavored to make up for the poor response to Tical 0  The Prequel  Around this time  he was heavily featured in the media due to his displeasure with Def Jam s handling of his previous project  Despite what the rapper felt to be little promotion compared to other Def Jam artists  421    debuted in the Billboard Top Ten  and received much greater reviews than those of his previous album  Method Man also made the decision to fall back from Hollywood  and to only do acting work on films being handled by close friends   The summer of 2007 was the original release date scheduled for Raekwon s long anticipated sequel to his 1995 debut Only Built 4 Cuban Linx  entitled Only Built 4 Cuban Linx    Pt  II  The album was to be released on Dr  Dre s Aftermath Records  however  it would turn out to be released on Raekwon s Ice H2O Records  and EMI on September 8  2009  after numerous delays   Ghostface Killah released his seventh full length album The Big Doe Rehab in December 2007  and exactly one week later  Wu Tang released their fifth full length group album entitled 8 Diagrams on Steve Rifkind s SRC Records  whose now defunct Loud Records released the group s four previous albums  This album marked the inclusion of Cappadonna as an official member of the group  In an interview with MTV com  Ghostface Killah stated that he was upset with RZA for starting the 8 Diagrams project while he was in the middle of writing and recording The Big Doe Rehab  and further upset with RZA for giving 8 Diagrams the same release date as The Big Doe Rehab  for which RZA re scheduled a release date one week later  The final outcome of 8 Diagrams received mixed views from both fans and critics  and is regarded as being RZA s most experimental work to date  Both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah were unhappy with the album  and proposed recording a group album titled  Shaolin Vs  Wu Tang  without RZA production  That album would eventually become Raekwon s fifth solo album Shaolin vs  Wu Tang   In the summer of 2008  RZA released Digi Snacks  which was another Bobby Digital album  He used the album primarily to put over lesser known Wu Tang Clan affiliates such as Freemurder  Killa Sin  Black Knights and others  The summer of 2008 also saw the release of GZA s Pro Tools album   Almost a year later  U God released his third solo album entitled Dopium  which features guest appearances from several Wu Tang members  and affiliates  among others  and was met with mostly lukewarm reviews  Released one week later was Wu Tang Chamber Music  a side project executively produced by RZA  featuring live instrumentation from a Brooklyn soul band called The Revelations  The album features appearances from five Wu Tang members  along with New York City mainstays AZ  Kool G Rap  Cormega  Havoc  Sean Price  and M O P  The first single from Chamber Music was a track titled  Harbor Masters  featuring Ghostface Killah  Inspectah Deck  and AZ  To clear up confusion  RZA spoke about the album to Billboard com   September 2009 saw the release of the long anticipated album  Only Built 4 Cuban Linx    Pt  II which features guest appearances from several big name artists  and Clan members  with Ghostface being the most prominent  and also production from RZA  Dr  Dre  Pete Rock  and J Dilla  among others  The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 and at number 2 on the Top R&B Hip Hop Albums chart  and has been praised by most music critics  Several weeks later  Ghostface released Ghostdini  Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City  which is a hip hop R&B album   Talk of the album Shaolin vs  Wu Tang re surfaced in July 2009  originally planned as a full on Wu album without RZA s input  the project evolved to include RZA from an MC standpoint  without contributing to production  Raekwon stated   Speaking to MTV com  Method Man revealed his  Ghostface Killah s and Raekwon s plans to record a separate album as a trio   Soon after  Ghostface Killah cemented the details  the record—featuring other Wu Tang Clan members—will consist primarily of him  Method Man  and Raekwon  The title  as announced in three separate trailers  directed by Rik Cordero  promoting the upcoming release  is Wu Massacre  Speaking on their willingness to complete the album  Ghost said the three would begin recording within the next few months and estimated the release date to be the end of 2009 or January 2010   More recently  it was announced that the album would be pushed back from December to March 30  2010  the single   Meth vs  Chef Part II   was released after the announcement  Produced by Mathematics  it is an update of the song  Meth vs  Chef  from Method Man s first solo album  Tical  featuring verses by only Method Man and Raekwon  It had been confirmed by Raekwon that Shaolin vs  Wu Tang would in fact be his next solo album and that Wu Massacre is a separate project  while the rapper stated that he himself had petitioned to have Wu Massacre s release date postponed in order to yield more studio time   On February 25  2011 Wu Tang Live At The Palladium NYC was released through the groups official Facebook page as a collectors digital download  This included exclusive  unreleased freestyles  It was limited to 100 downloads before the page was disabled after this figure was reached   1 6 1  Business deals  In September 2008  RZA announced that he had inked a deal with digital music company The Orchard to release the Wu Tang Clan s back catalogue worldwide digitally  for the first time  In addition to forthcoming material  the Wu Tang Clan s catalogue includes 13 previous releases that have been previously unavailable digitally  including recordings by the group as a whole  U God  Wu Syndicate  Killarmy  Shyheim  West Coast Killa Beez  Black Knights and others  and will be available online beginning September 23   The time is right to bring some older Wu material to the masses digitally   said RZA  de facto leader of Wu Tang Clan   Our fans have been dedicated and patient and they re hungry to hear the music that has set us apart from so many others  Hip hop is alive in Wu Music  and with The Orchard  we ve got a solid partner that understands our audience and is committed to doing all they can to help us reach the fans  I m definitely looking forward to working with them to see what else we all come up with  There s much more to come    1 6 2  Documentaries  Gerald K  Barclay directed the Wu Tang documentary  entitled Wu  The Story of the Wu Tang Clan  which premiered on BET on November 13  2008  The

a new studio album  still in early stages  Ghostface Killah later said that the album should be released in May 2012   Members went back and forth on the issue  While GZA hinted that a new album was unlikely  the RZA said a new Wu Tang Clan album might happen after all  on the occasion of the group s 20th anniversary  though Raekwon doubted it   On January 9  2013  work on the sixth Wu Tang Clan album was announced via the group s official Facebook page  In early March 2013 Method Man announced that the Clan was working on a sixth studio album and it would be released during 2013 in celebration of their 20 year anniversary since 36 Chambers  Cappadonna has said the album is in recording process taking place in New York  Los Angeles and the Wu mansion in New Jersey  RZA has also said he had talked to Adrian Younge about working on a song for the album  On April 11  2013  it was announced via a press release that their upcoming sixth studio album would be titled  A Better Tomorrow and was set to be released in July  2013  During late April 2013  the Clan performed at the 2013 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival  On May 17  a unreleased Wu Tang song titled

 and the Wu Mansion West  Unreleased verses from Ol  Dirty Bastard will also be featured on the album  He also stated he was hoping to release the album in November 2013  In July 2013 Cappadonna indicated the album was half way finished  Once November 2013 arrived  RZA gave an update on the album  saying that not every member had been significantly working on the album  He gave credit to Method Man  Cappadonna  U God and Masta Killa for working hard on the album  while saying he needed more effort from Ghostface  Raekwon and GZA  Shortly after Method Man stated that Raekwon had not worked on the album at all  and Ghostface had only recorded two songs for the album so far  In late November  RZA suggested that the album was approximately six weeks from completion  In January 2014  the group posted a message on their Facebook page  saying   The new Wu album  A Better Tomorrow  coming soon   After several disputes between Raekwon and RZA about the direction of the group and album  they reconciled  with the latter agreeing to record verses for A Better Tomorrow  On October 3  2014 it was announced that the album will arrive December 2  2014 courtesy of a new deal with Warner

website  The album is encased in a handcrafted silver and nickel box made by British Moroccan artist Yahya and features never before heard music recorded over years  RZA stated he has been receiving multiple million dollar offers for the album  Despite the album s exclusivity it made an appearance in electronic dance music producer Skrillex s music video for his song  Fuck That  even though he

sitcom Method & Red  both co starring with Redman  with whom he also made an album in 1999 titled Blackout  as well as the 2009 sequel Blackout  2  Method Man s friendship with the Notorious B I G  is credited for preventing more heat between Biggie  Raekwon and Ghostface   Ol  Dirty Bastard  born Russell Jones  1968–2004  – Arguably the most eccentric and erratic member of the group  his wild behavior drew significant media – and often police – attention  He was known for his off beat rhymes  charismatic ululations  slightly garbled style  and unpredictable vocal inflections  ODB was among the most popular members of Wu Tang  with high sales and guest spots with industry giants like Mariah Carey  He collapsed in Wu Tang s recording studio on November 13  2004 and was pronounced dead less than an hour later  with a later autopsy confirming an accidental drug overdose to be the cause of his death   Raekwon  born Corey Woods  1970  – Nicknamed  The Chef  for having  lyrical flavor   and ability to cook cocaine into  crack rock   His lyrics contain extensive use of New York slang  and some of which he invented   which is often delivered in an aggressive  fast paced manner  He is also known for his vivid storytelling about wealth  power  and prestige derived from the illegal drug trade  His influential solo album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx    is often credited with initiating the Mafioso rap phenomenon of the mid to late 1990s  and is generally considered one of the best of the solo albums by both fans and critics  The sequel to the influential album was released in late 2009 titled Only Built 4 Cuban Linx    Pt  II   U God  born Lamont Hawkins  1970  – A founding member with his own solo career  U God s has had a relatively low profile  in part due to his limited exposure  from being incarcerated for most of the recording of 36 Chambers  in which he only delivered short verses on  Da Mystery of Chessboxin   and  Protect Ya Neck   He is known for delivering strong verses  his unique  bass like  voice  and his style of blaxploitation rap   Cappadonna  born Darryl Hill  1969  – After growing up as friends with many of the Clan members  Cappadonna made his debut as an affiliate of the Wu Tang Clan on Raekwon s hit single  Ice Cream   He was also a guest star  along with Raekwon  on Ghostface Killah s solo debut album  Ironman  He made his first appearance on a Wu Tang Clan album in 1997 on Wu Tang Forever on the single  Triumph   Following his appearance on Forever  he contributed significantly to the group s third studio album  The W  at which point his appearances were no longer marked with  Feat  Cappadonna   as they had been on Forever  After a falling out with RZA the next year over royalties  he did not appear at all on the group s subsequent album Iron Flag  He eventually reunited with the group for their concert at 2004 s Rock the Bells  and appeared on 2007 s 8 Diagrams   2 1  Production  According to RZA  he tries to have no more than 20–25% sampling on any given record  something starkly different from many other major hip hop groups  He uses  the sampler more like a painter s palette than a Xerox  Then again  I might use it as a Xerox if I find rare beats that nobody had in their crates yet   He played much of the piano himself  with Bill Evans and Thelonious Monk as major influences  for instance  he created the piano part to  Da Mystery of Chessboxin   after watching the Thelonious Monk documentary  Straight  No Chaser   RZA s production technique  specifically the manner of chopping up and or speeding or slowing soul samples to fit his beats  has been picked up by currently popular producers  most notably Kanye West and Just Blaze  the two main producers behind Roc A Fella Records  West s own take on RZA s style briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed  chipmunk soul   the pitch bending of a vocal sample to where it sounded as though the singer had inhaled helium  Several producers at the time copied the style  creating other offshoots  West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by RZA s production  and RZA has acknowledged his influence in an issue of Scratch magazine  saying he wished he had produced  Jesus Walks  and  Breathe   two 2004 hits produced by Kanye West and Just Blaze  respectively  Kanye West commented   2 2  Lyrics  Raekwon s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx    helped  with the likes of Kool G Rap  popularize the Mafia theme in rap music that remained widespread for more than half a decade  The landmark album touted a lifestyle patterned on drug dealing  regrets of living in harsh conditions  and partying  including popularizing the Cristal brand of champagne  which Nas  Mobb Deep  Notorious B I G   Jay Z  and other popular artists all borrowed and or expanded upon these themes at points in their respective careers   The Wu Tang Clan s slang has long been a staple of their music  wherein members would blend Five Percenter terms  Kung Fu oriental words  and comic book and street terms to create their own nicknames for actions  people  places and things  such as the christening of Staten Island as  Shaolin Land  and money as  C R E A M     RZA noted in the The Wu Tang Manual  that Raekwon was the resident slang master of a great deal of the slang used by the group   3  Syndication  3 1  Video games  All nine original members of the group were featured in the game Wu Tang  Shaolin Style  released for the PlayStation on October 31  1999  as well as a special collector s edition controller  Ghostface Killah and Yung Dirty Doucette  as well as collaborators  Redman and Keith Murray  also play themselves in all three games in the Def Jam video games Def Jam Vendetta  Def Jam Fight For NY  and Def Jam  Icon   Method Man is a huge fan of video games himself and has publicly stated that he loves playing SOCOM online with other PlayStation 2 users  and is part of an online clan   KMA Kiss My Ass    His SOCOM II name is  ICU   He has a fellow SOCOM player featured on a skit on his album 4 21   A video game from Acclaim  9Dragons  also sports the name Wu Tang Clan in one of the ingame branches   In EA s Army of Two  main character Salem talks about Wu Tang asking his team mate Rios who the best member is  Salem says it s RZA but he says Ghostface Killah is pretty good himself  In the ending cut scene  a reference is made when Salem says  Survey says   and Rios replies  You re dead   The exchange referenced the lyric   And the survey says    You re dead   from  Wu Tang Clan Ain t Nuthin  Ta F  Wit   from the album Enter the Wu Tang Clan  36 Chambers    Several tracks by Clan members and affiliates such as Method Man  Ghostface  Cappadonna  Trife  DJ Mathematics and others were featured in the 2006 game Saints Row   The video game of Afro Samurai  based on the cult TV series  was released in January 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360  Its soundtrack  like the show  was produced by RZA   3 2  Clothing line  Oli  Power  Grant was one of the first to move from music to clothes  The executive producer of the Wu Tang Clan  Grant started making clothes in the early 1990s  with little success  But in 1995  with the platinum success of Enter the Wu Tang  36 Chambers   suddenly the manufacturers that earlier wouldn t extend Power credit saw the potential  Power opened four Wu Wear stores  in New York City  Los Angeles  Atlanta and Norfolk  Virginia   the line is carried in Macy s  Rich s  and d e m o  among others  Power says he earned $10 million in 1998   Method Man was unhappy with the decision to bring Wu Tang into the fashion world with Wu Wear  despite the brand being a major money maker for the group   When Wu Wear started making shoes and sneakers and pants  it was shoddy material  I never rocked that shit    In 1999  Nike released a Wu Tang Clan themed dunk hi  The shoes were produced in low quantities  Their rarity and popularity makes them very sought after  leading reseller prices to be as much as $7 500   A partnership between Wu Tang and the Alife NYC clothing group took place in 2007 through 2008 for an exclusive series of custom sneakers  T shirts  hoodies and other accessories for both men and women  The collection was named  A Wu Tang Life    4  Controversy  4 1  G Unit  Ghostface had a non publicized feud with 50 Cent in the late 1990s and early 2000s  On 50 Cent s track  How to Rob  insults were aimed at many high profile rappers  including Wu Tang  In the early 2000s the argument made it on to wax with skits titled  Clyde Smith  on Supreme Clientele featuring a low pitched recording of what most fans believe to be Raekwon s voice derisively making fun of 50 Cent s behavior and his methods of attracting attention to himself  The skit also joked at other unnamed  gangster rappers  in New York  50 Cent took offense and came back with a short track dissing Wu Tang Clan  and Ghostface in particular  That track was later reworked into the titled Too Hot with 50 rapping over a sample of Ghostface on Raekwon s album  50 rose to fame  both he and Ghostface talked in interviews with SOHH com and Hot 97 Radio about the supposed argument  both saying that the argument was never that serious and nothing major had happened   A supposed diss song   Small Change  Who The Fuck Is 50 Cent    which circulated the web in the beginning of 2001 was rumoured to be by the Clan  but was proven to be recorded by Polite and Lord Superb of American Cream Team  Raekwon s then side project    G Unit member Tony Yayo has alleged that Ghostface had a ghostwriter for his critically acclaimed album Supreme Clientele  In an interview with Spin magazine  Yayo claimed that Far Rockaway native Lord Superb  who guested on the album  wrote a majority  if not all  of the lyrics  In an interview with hiphopdx com Raekwon  who also appears on the album  responded saying   He  Tony Yayo  know damn well he  Superb  ain’t write that fuckin’ album  I don’t even wanna get into shit like that  because it just makes me upset that muthafuckas be running they mouth all kinda ways  But at the end of the day  I think Ghost gonna have to really say what he gotta say   However  in a November 2007 interview with Rhapsody Music  Ghost responded with      Perb  Superb  is Rae’s  Raekwon  man  He been in the studio a few times while we’re doing shit  He ain’t write shit  All ‘Perb contributed was a couple of lines that you could put in the air  When we write  we all do that  “Say this one right here” or “Put this one right here ” We all catch lines with each other ‘cause you in the studio  You got niggas around you that write  Even if he did write a verse  he could never make an album of mine  He couldn’t make an album  you feel me  I made Supreme Clientele what it is  Those are my stories  based around whatever they’re based upon  It’s me  I can’t see what songs ‘Perb wrote  He ain’t write “Mighty Healthy” or “One” or “Apollo Kids” or “Cherchez LaGhost” or “Saturday Nite” or “Malcolm ” U God called Tony Yayo  a bitch  in an interview with Undergroundhiphop com  and threatened to beat him down when he sees him  but said that no diss tracks will be recorded  Paper Plates  one of the tracks from GZA s Pro Tools album released in 2008 is known to be a 50 cent diss track  The feud between GZA and 50 started in a concert in London  where GZA was performing and during the concert he was responding to what the crowd had to say about the current state of Hip Hop particularly in the Mainstream world  Soulja Boy and 50 cent were both mentioned  GZA made some comments such as   Fifty doesn t have any motherfuckin  lyrics  You got a lot of record sales  a lot of money nigga but no TALENT    50 cent responded back to GZA on his thoughts about his comments directed at Soulja Boy  whom he has a good relationship with personally   Recently I seen a video on YouTube and the video was of the GZA  that s short for The Genius  He s a  Genius   I m sure everyone else has forgotten who he is also  Kid is 16 years old and we Googled you  you were born in  66  He was born in 1966  laughs   Listen  I have an old school Chevy Impala your age   50 has yet to record a diss track in response to GZA s  Paper Plate    4 2  The Notorious B I G   During his career  The Notorious B I G  had a checkered relationship with the Wu Tang Clan  He collaborated with Raekwon on the 1994 Ron G song  Stop the Breaks   which also featured Killa Sin and KRS One  the same year  on B I G  s debut album Ready to Die  Method Man was featured on the song  The What   and was the only featured rapper on the album   The song   The What   was produced by Easy Mo Bee  who had strong ties to Notorious B I G  as well as several Clan members  such as RZA and GZA  According to Method Man  though even at this point friction was present between Biggie and the Clan  the two rappers got along   In 1995  on the album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx     Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commented on Big in a skit called  Shark Niggas  Biters    Alleging that he copied the cover from Nas  landmark release Illmatic  as well as styles from other rap artists  This generated longstanding controversy over their differences with Biggie  and in later interviews  both rappers would downplay the incident   In the Wu Tang Manual  a book by the RZA on the origins of the Wu Tang Clan  he recalls a concert at which Biggie and Wu Tang both performed  at which Raekwon and Ghostface were reportedly under the influence  and angry at some comments BIG made in The Source  In RZA s view  had the artists and their entourages met up that night  things could have gotten violent  but nothing of the sort ever occurred  It is worth mentioning that on B I G  s final studio album Life After Death he took a shot back at Raekwon on the song  Kick in the Door   which was a diss song to several other rappers as well  with the line   Fuck that  why try Throw bleach in ya eye  which was a response to lyrics from Raekwon s song  Ice Water   where Raekwon rhymed      To top it all off  beefin  for White Pullin  bleach out  tryin a throw it in my eyesight   On the posthumous 1997 song  Victory   released on Puff Daddy s album No Way Out  B I G  also rhymes   Militant Y all faggots ain t killin  shit   in response to a Ghostface Killah line on the song  Criminology  where he raps   RZA baked the track and it s militant Then I react like a convict  and start killin  shit   It is also worth mentioning that B I G  chose RZA to produce the track  Long Kiss Goodnight   a song allegedly aimed at Biggie s longtime rival Tupac Shakur  which appeared on Life After Death  RZA went on to comment about the collaboration  saying   On the same album  B I G  gave thanks to Wu Tang in the album s liner notes  and also inserted lyrics praising the Wu Tang Clan single  C R E A M    on the song  Notorious Thugs   he states   I mma tell you like a nigga told me Cash rules everything around me   On his 2002 album God s Son  Nas references the feud on his song  Last Real Nigga Alive   implying that although he and Big had their differences  they were friendly  while he was also on good terms with Raekwon  neither Big nor Raekwon got along  and both warned Nas the other would copy his lyrics and style  In 2006  Ghostface and Raekwon did a posthumous collaboration with Biggie  on the song  Three Bricks   which was originally intended to appear on the posthumous Biggie album  Duets  The Final Chapter  but it instead became a bonus song on the Ghostface Killah album Fishscale  In 2008  Raekwon did a cover of Jadakiss  hit  Letter to B I G    injecting his own thoughts on his deceased former rival   4 3  Sean Combs  In 1998  ODB rushed onstage unexpectedly during Shawn Colvin s acceptance speech for  Song of the Year  at the Grammy Awards  and began complaining that he had recently purchased expensive clothes in anticipation of winning the  Best Rap Album  award that he lost to Sean Combs  Before being escorted off stage  he implored the audience   I don t know how you all see it  but when it comes to the children  Wu Tang is for the children  We teach the children  Puffy is good  but Wu Tang is the best  I want you all to know that this is ODB  and I love you all  Peace   His bizarre onstage antics were widely reported in the mainstream media  Dirty made it known on The Howard Stern Show that he meant no disrespect to Combs  but that feelings were hurt on Combs  end  Later that night Combs  bodyguards would physically threaten ODB  but Dirty insisted to his friends and family in attendance that no violence broke out  Following the award show  Howard Stern asked Dirty about the incident with Diddy s bodyguards on his radio show  but Dirty wouldn t play up the incident as he didn t want to shine a bad light on hip hop because of one minor altercation   Ghostface appeared on the 2002 Bad Boy Records release  We Invented the Remix  along with Combs on the remix to the song  Special Delivery   Ghostface even gives Bad Boy Records a shout out for inviting him on the track when he raps  Bad Boy  thank you for this special delivery   Combs was one of the executive producers for Method Man s 2004 album Tical 0  The Prequel  although Meth later voiced his displeasure with the final product   On the third LP  it was suggested to bring in Harve Pierre and P Diddy  Who am I to argue  Puff knows how to sell some records  But that wasn t the direction to go in  and I know that now   In 2006  Method Man also called out Combs  decisions on the posthumous Notorious B I G  album Duets  The Final Chapter  saying that Biggie never would have rocked with some of the sub par rappers featured on it  He also brought up the fact that he was the only other rapper that Biggie chose to feature on his debut album Ready to Die   4 4  Mase  After badmouthing Wu Tang at a concert  Bad Boy recording artist Mase had a run in with Ghostface and his entourage at a club in New York City  There was some sort of physical altercation between Mase s and Ghostface s camps  and Mase left the incident with a broken jaw  Kanye West is among several rappers who have made reference to the incident  rapping     if you could feel how my face felt  You would know how Mase felt     on his single  Through the Wire   Shyheim also referred to the incident in a freestyle  with the line  The Empire State  where Ghostface retired Mase   In the June 2007 issue of Hip Hop Connection magazine  Wu Tang affiliate Cilvaringz stated that Ghostface had in fact done time in jail for  beating up  Mase   4 5  Joe Budden  In 2009  Joe Budden posted a video blog voicing his opinion on a  Best rapper  readers  poll posted in Vibe magazine  Throughout the video  Budden gave examples of rappers who were ranked too high  and claimed to be better than half of the rappers on the list  Some of the people he mentioned were Melle Mel  Prodigy  Ol  Dirty Bastard  and Method Man  At the end of the video  he went on to say that he d beat Method Man in a battle if they were face to face  Shortly after this  Budden called into Ed Lover s Power 105 1  and took his claim on Method Man even further by stating   Lyrically  I will cut that man s head off his shoulders   Several weeks later  Joe Budden did a freestyle track titled  D O A  Freestyle   which many speculated of containing veiled shots towards Method Man and several members of Wu Tang  Method Man was overseas while all of this occurred  but eventually spoke out about it on several radio interviews  While Raekwon was on the Rock the Bells tour with Joe Budden and his group Slaughterhouse  the two got together to settle any bad blood   This calmed things down for a short while  until Wu Tang member Inspectah Deck released a Joe Budden diss track entitled  House Nigga   which was a response to Budden s remarks  A few days after releasing this track  on July 9  2009  Deck went on stage at the Columbia  MD show of Rock the Bells  during Raekwon s set  and told the audience the reason for the diss track was because  the nigga tried to diss my brother  he tried to shit on my nigga like my nigga aint a made man     fuck Joe Budden   referring to what Budden said about Method Man   Joe Budden did not retaliate with a diss track  but however  posted a five minute video blog in which he said that he wanted to slap Deck and called Deck a coward  At the San Bernardino stop of Rock the Bells  Raekwon approached Budden with his Ice Water Inc  entourage  resulting in Budden getting punched in the right eye  Shortly after this occurred  Joe Budden posted yet another online video blog of him with an ice pack over his eye  with many speculating Raekwon as the one who did the assault   It was later revealed that the punch was thrown by a member of Raekwon s entourage named Hanz  Hanz stated that he  did not appreciate Budden speaking disrespectfully about Inspectah Deck and Method Man in interviews over the summer   He further commented  I punched him in the face because he was outta line  I look at him like  not the school yard bully  but the motherfucker that s always picking on a motherfucker that don t fuck with nobody  To say something about a nigga like Meth is crazy  Meth don t fuck with nobody  I m not gonna sit here and say Rae made me do it  that was a spontaneous decision on my own  I m glad I did it   cause he got a big mouth   It wasn t actually planned  he could have actually changed that whole situation as it unfolded  as it went on    Although Joe Budden and Raekwon reportedly were sat down and forced to settle things on the final day of the tour  Budden released a video on his website challenging Raekwon to a one on one fight  and called on all his fans to help persuade Raekwon to accept  despite the fact that it wasn t Raekwon who threw the punch  Raekwon however did not accept  and explained that he is a grown man with a family  and that fighting would be childish  He also stated  This has never ever been a Wu Tang versus Slaughterhouse thing  this is about a kid who gets off on doing blogs  My thing is this  I m a business man  I m here to make money  take care of my family and keep as many people safe and sound as possible  We not gonna take it there  cause that s little shit  we are grown men  I will never jump out the window to sacrifice the situation with my family for something that ain t worth it   Since the incident  Budden has stated in interviews the feud was over  and Raekwon made a similar announcement during a show  stating that he  had love  for Joe Budden   5  Wu Tang affiliates and associates  The Wu Tang Clan has a wide range of collaborators and associates  Close
