The Miranda warning  also referred to as Miranda rights or Miranda rule  is a right to silence warning given by police in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody  or in a custodial interrogation  before they are interrogated to preserve the admissibility of their statements against them in criminal proceedings   The Miranda warning is part of a preventive criminal procedure rule that law enforcement are required to administer to protect an individual who is in custody and subject to direct questioning or its functional equivalent from a violation of his or her Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination  In Miranda v  Arizona  the Supreme Court held that the admission of an elicited incriminating statement by a suspect not informed of these rights violates the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel  through the incorporation of these rights into state law  Thus  if law enforcement officials decline to offer a Miranda warning to an individual in their custody  they may interrogate that person and act upon the knowledge gained  but may not use that person s statements as evidence against him or her in a criminal trial   In Berghuis v  Thompkins  the Supreme Court held that unless a suspect expressly states that he or she is invoking this right  subsequent voluntary statements made to an officer can be used against him in court  and police can continue to interact with  or question  the suspect   1  Miranda rights  The concept of  Miranda rights  was enshrined in U S  law following the 1966 Miranda v  Arizona Supreme Court decision  which found that the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights of Ernesto Arturo Miranda had been violated during his arrest and trial for armed robbery  kidnapping  and rape of a mentally handicapped young woman   Miranda was subsequently retried and convicted    The circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards i e  Miranda rights are  custody  and  interrogation   Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest  Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response  The Supreme Court did not specify the exact wording to use when informing a suspect of his her rights  However  the Court did create a set of guidelines that must be followed  The ruling states   As a result  American English developed the verb Mirandize  meaning  read the Miranda warning to  a suspect  when the suspect is arrested    Notably  the Miranda rights do not have to be read in any particular order  and they do not have to precisely match the language of the Miranda case as long as they are adequately and fully conveyed  California v  Prysock     In Berkemer v  McCarty  1984  the Supreme Court decided that a person subjected to custodial interrogation is entitled to the benefit of the procedural safeguards enunciated in Miranda  regardless of the nature or severity of the offense of which he is suspected or for which he was arrested  On June 1  2010  in deciding the Berghuis v  Thompkins case  the United States Supreme Court declared that criminal defendant defendants who have been read the Miranda rights  and who have indicated they understand them and have not already waived them   must explicitly state during or before an interrogation begins that they wish to be silent and not speak to police for that protection against self incrimination to apply  If they speak to police about the incident before invoking the Miranda right to remain silent  or afterwards at any point during the interrogation or detention  the words they speak may be used against them if they have not stated they do not want to speak to police  Justice Anthony M  Kennedy wrote the opinion and was joined by Justices Scalia  Alito  and Thomas and by Chief Justice Roberts  Justices Sotomayor  Stevens  Ginsburg  and Breyer dissented  Elena Kagan  who had presented the government s case as Solicitor General of the U S  and who was nominated to succeed Justice Stevens  supported Kennedy s ruling in her arguments that pointed out that the ruling spelled out for prosecutors and defendants just how the right against self incrimination applies in such cases  Those who oppose the ruling contend that the requirement that the defendant must speak to indicate his intention to remain silent further erodes the ability of the defendant to stay completely silent about the case  This opposition must be put in context with the second option offered by the majority opinion  which allowed that the defendant had the option of remaining silent  saying   Had he wanted to remain silent  he could have said nothing in response or unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights  ending the interrogation   Thus  having been  Mirandized   a suspect may avow explicitly the invocation of these rights  or  alternatively  simply remain silent  Absent the former   anything  said  can and will be used against  the defendant  in a court of law    2  Typical usage  Every U S  jurisdiction has its own regulations regarding what  precisely  must be said to a person arrested or placed in a custodial situation  The typical warning states   You have the right to remain silent when questioned   Anything you say or do may be used against you in a court of law   You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future   If you cannot afford an attorney  one will be appointed for you before any questioning  if you wish   If you decide to answer any questions now  without an attorney present  you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney   Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you  are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present  The courts have since ruled that the warning must be  meaningful   so it is usually required that the suspect be asked if he she understands their rights  Sometimes  firm answers of  yes  are required  Some departments and jurisdictions require that an officer ask  do you understand   after every sentence in the warning  An arrestee s silence is not a waiver  but on June 1  2010  the Supreme Court ruled 5â€“4 that police are allowed to interrogate suspects who have invoked or waived their rights ambiguously  and any statement given during questioning prior to invocation or waiving is admissible as evidence  Evidence has in some cases been ruled inadmissible because of an arrestee s poor knowledge of English and the failure of arresting officers to provide the warning in the arrestee s language   Also because of various education levels  officers must make sure the suspect understands what the officer is saying  It may be necessary to  translate  to the suspect s level of understanding  Courts have ruled this admissible as long as the original waiver is said and the  translation  is recorded either on paper or on tape   2 1  Use in various U S  state jurisdictions  Some jurisdictions provide the right of a juvenile to remain silent if their parent or guardian is not present  Some departments in New Jersey  Nevada  Oklahoma  and Alaska modify the  providing an attorney  clause as follows   Even though this sentence may be somewhat ambiguous to some laypersons  who can  and who have actually interpreted it as meaning that they will not get a lawyer until they confess and are arraigned in court  the U S  Supreme Court has approved of it as an accurate description of the procedure in those states   In states bordering Mexico  including Texas  New Mexico  Arizona  and California  suspects who are not United States citizens are given an additional warning   Some states including Virginia require the following sentence  ensuring that the suspect knows that waiving Miranda rights is not a one time absolute occurrence   California  Texas  New York  Florida  Illinois  North Carolina  South Carolina  Virginia  Washington and Pennsylvania also add the following questions  presumably to comply with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations   An affirmative answer to both of the above questions waives the rights  If the suspect responds  no  to the first question  the officer is required to re read the Miranda warning  while saying  no  to the second question invokes the right at that moment  in either case the interviewing officer or officers cannot question the suspect until the rights are waived   Generally  when defendants invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination and refuse to testify or submit to cross examination at trial  the prosecutor cannot indirectly punish them for the exercise of a constitutional right by commenting on their silence and insinuating that it is an implicit admission of guilt  Since Miranda rights are simply a judicial gloss upon the Fifth Amendment which protects against coercive interrogations  the same rule also prevents prosecutors from commenting about the post arrest silence of suspects who invoke their Miranda rights immediately after arrest  However  neither the Fifth Amendment nor Miranda extend to pre arrest silence  which means that if a defendant takes the witness stand at trial  meaning he just waived his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent   the prosecutor can attack his credibility with his pre arrest silence  based on his failure to immediately turn himself in and confess to the things he voluntarily testified about at trial    Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice  Article 31 provides for the right against compelled self incrimination  Interrogation subjects under Army jurisdiction must first be given Department of the Army Form 3881  which informs them of the charges and their rights  and the subjects must sign the form  The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps require that all arrested personnel be read the  rights of the accused  and must sign a form waiving those rights if they so desire  a verbal waiver is not sufficient   It has been discussed whether a Miranda warningâ€”if spoken or in writingâ€”could be appropriately given to disabled persons  For example   the right to remain silent  means little to a deaf individual and the word  constitutional  may not be understood by people with only an elementary education  In one case  a deaf murder suspect was kept at a therapy station until he was able to understand the meaning of the Miranda warning and other judicial proceedings   3  Public safety exception  The Miranda rule is not  however  absolute  An exception exists in cases of  public safety   This limited and case specific exception allows certain unadvised statements  given without Miranda warnings  to be admissible into evidence at trial when they were elicited in circumstances where there was great danger to public safety   The public safety exception derives from New York v  Quarles  1984   a case in which the Supreme Court considered the admissibility of a statement elicited by a police officer who apprehended a rape suspect who was thought to be carrying a firearm  The arrest took place during the middle of the night in a supermarket that was open to the public but apparently deserted except for the clerks at the checkout counter  When the officer arrested the suspect  he found an empty shoulder holster  handcuffed the suspect  and asked him where the gun was  The suspect nodded in the direction of the gun  which was near some empty cartons  and said   The gun is over there   The Supreme Court found that such an unadvised statement was admissible in evidence because   i n a kaleidoscopic situation such as the one confronting these officers  where spontaneity rather than adherence to a police manual is necessarily the order of the day  the application of the exception we recognize today should not be made to depend on post hoc findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the police officer   Thus  the jurisprudential rule of Miranda must yield in  a situation where concern for public safety must be paramount to adherence to the literal language of the prophylactic rules enunciated in Miranda    The rule of Miranda is not  therefore  absolute and can be a bit more elastic in cases of public safety  Under this exception  to be admissible in the government s direct case at a trial  the questioning must not be  actually compelled by police conduct which overcame his will to resist   and must be focused and limited  involving a situation  in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety    In 2010  the Federal Bureau of Investigation encouraged agents to use a broad interpretation of public safety related questions in terrorism cases  stating that the  magnitude and complexity  of terrorist threats justified  a significantly more extensive public safety interrogation without Miranda warnings than would be permissible in an ordinary criminal case   continuing to list such examples as   questions about possible impending or coordinated terrorist attacks  the location  nature and threat posed by weapons that might pose an imminent danger to the public  and the identities  locations  and activities or intentions of accomplices who may be plotting additional imminent attacks   A Department of Justice spokesman described this position as not altering the constitutional right  but as clarifying existing flexibility in the rule   This exception was applied for 16 hours during the interrogation of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in 2013   4  The six rules  The Miranda rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings that is the product of custodial police interrogation  Miranda right to counsel and right to remain silent are derived from the self incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment  Therefore  for Miranda to apply  six requirements must be fulfilled   Evidence must have been gathered   The evidence must be testimonial   The evidence must have been obtained while the suspect was in custody   The evidence must have been the product of interrogation   The interrogation must have been conducted by state agents   The evidence must be offered by the state during a criminal prosecution   4 1  First requirement  Evidence must have been gathered  This requirement is obvious  If the suspect did not make a statement during the interrogation the fact that he was not advised of his Miranda rights is of no importance  Nor can the state offer evidence that the defendant asserted his rightsâ€”that he refused to talk   4 2  Second requirement  Miranda applies only to  testimonial  evidence as that term is defined under the Fifth Amendment  For purposes of the Fifth Amendment  testimonial statements mean communications that explicitly or implicitly relate a factual assertion  an assertion of fact or belief  or disclose information  The Miranda rule does not prohibit compelling a person to engage in non assertive conduct that is incriminating or may produce incriminating evidence  Thus  requiring a suspect to participate in identification procedures such as giving handwriting or voice exemplars  fingerprints  DNA samples  hair samples  and dental impressions is not within the Miranda rule  Such physical or real evidence is non testimonial and not protected by the Fifth Amendment self incrimination clause  On the other hand  certain non verbal conduct may be testimonial  For example  if the suspect nodded his head up and down in response to the question  did you kill the victim  the conduct is testimonial  it is the same as saying  yes I did  and Miranda would apply   4 3  Third requirement  The evidence must have been obtained while the suspect was in custody  This limitation follows from the fact that Miranda s purpose is to protect suspects from the compulsion inherent in the police dominated atmosphere attendant to arrest  Custody means either that the suspect was under arrest or that his freedom of movement was restrained to an extent  associated with a formal arrest   A formal arrest occurs when an officer  with the intent to make an arrest  takes a person into custody by the use of physical force or the person submits to the control of an officer who has indicated his intention to arrest the person  Telling a person he is  under arrest  is sufficient to satisfy this requirement even though the person may not be otherwise physically restrained  Absent a formal arrest  the issue is whether a reasonable person in the suspect s position would have believed that he was under  full custodial  arrest  Applying this objective test  the Court has held Miranda does not apply to roadside questioning of a stopped motorist or to questioning of a person briefly detained on the streetâ€”a Terry stop  Even though neither the motorist nor the pedestrian is free to leave  this interference with the freedom of action is not considered actual arrest or its functional equivalent for purposes of the Fifth Amendment  The court has similarly held that a person who voluntarily comes to the police station for purposes of questioning is not in custody and thus not entitled to Miranda warnings particularly when the police advise the suspect that he is not under arrest and free to leave   4 4  Fourth requirement  The evidence must have been the product of interrogation  A defendant who seeks to challenge the admissibility of a statement under Miranda must show that the statement was  prompted by police conduct that constituted  interrogation    A volunteered statement by a person in custody does not implicate Miranda  In Rhode Island v  Innis  the Supreme Court defined interrogation as express questioning and  any words or actions on the part of the police  other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody  that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect   Thus  a practice that the police  should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect     amounts to interrogation   For example  confronting the suspect with incriminating evidence may be sufficiently evocative to amount to interrogation because the police are implicitly communicating a question   How do you explain this   On the other hand   unforeseeable results of police words or actions  do not constitute interrogation  Under this definition  routine statements made during the administration of sobriety tests would not implicate Miranda  For example  a police officer arrests a person for impaired driving and takes him to the police station to administer an intoxilyzer test  While at the station the officer also asks the defendant to perform certain psycho physical tests such as the walk and turn  one leg stand or finger to nose test  It is standard practice to instruct the arrestee on how to perform the test and to demonstrate the test   Note that the police will not tell the person that they have the right to refuse to perform the test  and the refusal cannot be used in evidence against them  nor can they be in any way punished for refusing to perform it  same as the police will not tell someone that they may refuse to perform a roadside sobriety test without penalty   An incriminating statement made by an arrestee during the instruction   I couldn t do that even if I was sober   would not be the product of interrogation  Similarly  incriminating statements made in response to requests for consent to search a vehicle or other property are not considered to be the product of interrogation   4 5  Fifth requirement  The interrogation must have been conducted by state agents  To establish a violation of the defendant s Fifth Amendment rights  the defendant must show state action  In the Miranda context  this means that the interrogation must have been conducted by a known state agent  If the interrogation was conducted by a person known by the suspect to be a law enforcement officer the state action requirement is unquestionably met  On the other hand  where a private citizen obtains a statement there is no state action regardless of the custodial circumstances surrounding the statement  A confession obtained through the interrogation by an undercover police officer or a paid informant does not violate Miranda because there is no coercion  no police dominated atmosphere if the suspect does not know that they are being questioned by the police  Private security guards and  private  police present special problems  They are generally not regarded as state agents  However  an interrogation conducted by a police officer moonlighting as a security guard may well trigger Miranda s safeguards since an officer is considered to be  on duty  at all times   4 6  Sixth requirement  The evidence is being offered during a criminal proceeding  Under the exclusionary rule  a Miranda defective statement cannot be used by the prosecution as substantive evidence of guilt  However  the Fifth Amendment exclusionary rule applies only to criminal proceedings  In determining whether a particular proceeding is criminal  the courts look at the punitive nature of the sanctions that could be imposed  Labels are irrelevant  The question is whether the consequences of an outcome adverse to the defendant could be characterized as punishment  Clearly a criminal trial is a criminal proceeding since if convicted the defendant could be fined or imprisoned  However  the possibility of loss of liberty does not make the proceeding criminal in nature  For example  commitment proceedings are not criminal proceedings even though they can result in long confinement because the confinement is considered rehabilitative in nature and not punishment  Similarly  Miranda does not apply directly to probation revocation proceedings because the evidence is not being used as a basis for imposing additional punishment   4 7  Application of the requirements  Assuming that the six requirements are present and Miranda applies  the statement will be subject to suppression unless the prosecution can demonstrate   that the suspect was advised of their Miranda rights and  that the suspect voluntarily waived those rights or that the circumstances fit an exception to the Miranda rule  The defendant may also be able to challenge the admissibility of the statement under provisions of state constitutions and state criminal procedure statutes   It is important to note that immigrants who live in the United States illegally are also protected and should receive their Miranda warnings as well when being interrogated or placed under arrest   Aliens receive constitutional protections when they have come within the territory of the United States and  have  developed substantial connections with this country    The Fifth Amendment right to counsel  a component of the Miranda Rule  is different from the Sixth Amendment right to counsel  In the context of the law of confessions the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is defined by the Massiah Doctrine  Massiah v  United States  377 U S  201  1964     5  The Miranda warnings  The circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards i e  Miranda warnings are  custody  and  interrogation   Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest  Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response  Suspects in  custody  who are about to be interrogated must be properly advised of their Miranda rightsâ€”namely  the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination  and  in furtherance of this right  the right to counsel while in custody   The Fifth Amendment right to counsel means that the suspect has the right to consult with an attorney before questioning begins and have an attorney present during the interrogation  The Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination is the right to remain silentâ€”the right to refuse to answer questions or to otherwise communicate information  Therefore  before any interrogation begins  the police must advise the suspect that   they have the right to remain silent   anything the suspect does say can and may be used against them   they have the right to have an attorney present before and during the questioning  and  they have the right  if they cannot afford the services of an attorney  to have one appointed  at public expense and without cost to them  to represent them before and during the questioning  There is no precise language that must be used in advising a suspect of their Miranda rights  The point is that whatever language is used the substance of the rights outlined above must be communicated to the suspect  The suspect may be advised of their rights orally or in writing   The Supreme Court has resisted efforts to require officers to more fully advise suspects of their rights  For example  the police are not required to advise the suspect that they can stop the interrogation at any time  that the decision to exercise the right cannot be used against the suspect  or that they have a right to talk to a lawyer before being asked any questions  Nor have the courts required to explain the rights  For example  the standard Miranda right to counsel states You have a right to have an attorney present during the questioning  Police are not required to explain that this right is not merely a right to have a lawyer present while the suspect is being questioned  The right to counsel includes   the right to talk to a lawyer before deciding whether to talk to police   if the defendant decides to talk to the police  the right to consult with a lawyer before being interrogated   the right to answer police only through an attorney  The duty to warn only arises when police officers conduct custodial interrogations  The Constitution does not require that a defendant be advised of the Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure  or once officer has probable cause to arrest  or if the defendant has become a suspect of the focus of an investigation  Custody and interrogation are the events that trigger the duty to warn   6  Waiver  Simply advising the suspect of their rights does not fully comply with the Miranda rule  The suspect must also voluntarily waive their Miranda rights before questioning can proceed  An express waiver is not necessary  However  most law enforcement agencies use written waiver forms  These include questions designed to establish that the suspect expressly waived their rights  Typical waiver questions are   Do you understand each of these rights   and   Understanding each of these rights  do you now wish to speak to the police without a lawyer being present   The waiver must be  knowing and intelligent  and it must be  voluntary   These are separate requirements  To satisfy the first requirement the state must show that the suspect generally understood their rights  right to remain silent and right to counsel  and the consequences of forgoing those rights  that anything they said could be used against them in court   To show that the waiver was  voluntary  the state must show that the decision to waive the rights was not the product of police coercion  If police coercion is shown or evident  then the court proceeds to determine the voluntariness of the waiver under the totality of circumstances test focusing on the personal characteristics of the accused and the particulars of the coercive nature of the police conduct  The ultimate issue is whether the coercive police conduct was sufficient to overcome the will of a person under the totality of the circumstances  As noted previously  courts traditionally focused on two categories of factors in making this determination   1  the personal characteristics of the suspect and  2  the circumstances attendant to the waiver  However  the Supreme Court significantly altered the voluntariness standard in the case of Colorado v  Connelly  In Connelly  the Court held that  Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to a finding that a confession is not  voluntary  within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment   The Court has applied this same standard of voluntariness in determining whether a waiver of a suspect s Fifth Amendment Miranda rights was voluntary  Thus  a waiver of Miranda rights is voluntary unless the defendant can show that their decision to waive their rights and speak to the police was the product of police misconduct and coercion that overcame the defendant s free will  After Connelly  the traditional totality of circumstances analysis is not even reached unless the defendant can first show such coercion by the police  Under Connelly  a suspect s decisions need not be the product of rational deliberations  In addition to showing that the waiver was  voluntary   the prosecution must also show that the waiver was  knowing  and  intelligent   Essentially this means the prosecution must prove that the suspect had a basic understanding of their rights and an appreciation of the consequences of foregoing those rights  The focus of the analysis is directly on the personal characteristics of the suspect  If the suspect was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs  or suffered from an emotional or mental condition that substantially impaired their capacity to make rational decisions  the courts may well decide that the suspect s waiver was not knowing and intelligent   A waiver must also be clear and unequivocal  An equivocal statement is ineffective as a waiver and the police may not proceed with the interrogation until the suspect s intentions are made clear  The requirement that a waiver be unequivocal must be distinguished from situations in which the suspect made an equivocal assertion of their Miranda rights after the interrogation began  Any post waiver assertion of a suspect s Miranda rights must be clear and unequivocal  Any ambiguity or equivocation will be ineffective  If the suspect s assertion is ambiguous  the interrogating officers are permitted to ask questions to clarify the suspect s intentions  although they are not required to  In other words  if a suspect s assertion is ambiguous  the police may either attempt to clarify the suspect s intentions or they may simply ignore the ineffective assertion and continue with the interrogation  The timing of the assertion is significant  Requesting an attorney prior to arrest is of no consequence because Miranda applies only to custodial interrogations  The police may simply ignore the request and continue with the questioning  however  the suspect is also free to leave   7  Assertion  If the defendant asserts his right to remain silent all interrogation must immediately stop and the police may not resume the interrogation unless the police have  scrupulously honored  the defendant s assertion and obtain a valid waiver before resuming the interrogation  In determining whether the police  scrupulously honored  the assertion the courts apply a totality of the circumstances test  The most important factors are the length of time between termination of original interrogation and commencement of the second and a fresh set of Miranda warnings before resumption of interrogation   The consequences of assertion of Sixth Amendment right to counsel are stricter  The police must immediately cease all interrogation and the police cannot reinitiate interrogation unless counsel is present  merely consulting with counsel is insufficient  or the defendant of his own volition contacts the police  If the defendant does reinitiate contact  a valid waiver must be obtained before interrogation may resume   In Berghuis v  Thompkins  the Court ruled that a suspect must clearly and unambiguously assert their right to silence  Merely remaining silent in face of protracted questioning is insufficient to assert the right   8  Exceptions  Assuming that the six factors are present  the Miranda rule would apply unless the prosecution can establish that the statement falls within an exception to the Miranda rule  The three exceptions are   the routine booking question exception  the jail house informant exception and  the public safety exception  Arguably only the last is a true exceptionâ€“the first two can better be viewed as consistent with the Miranda factors  For example  questions that are routinely asked as part of the administrative process of arrest and custodial commitment are not considered  interrogation  under Miranda because they are not intended or likely to produce incriminating responses  Nonetheless  all three circumstances are treated as exceptions to the rule  The jail house informant exception applies to situations where the suspect does not know that he is speaking to a state agent  either a police officer posing as a fellow inmate  a cellmate working as an agent for the state or a family member or friend who has agreed to cooperate with the state in obtaining incriminating information   The window of opportunity for the exception is small  Once the suspect is formally charged  the Sixth Amendment right to counsel would attach and surreptitious interrogation would be prohibited  The public safety exception applies where circumstances present a clear and present danger to the public s safety and the officers have reason to believe that the suspect has information that can end the emergency   9  Consequences of violation  Assuming that a Miranda violation occurredâ€”the six factors are present and no exception appliesâ€”the statement will be subject to suppression under the Miranda exclusionary rule  That is  if the defendant objects or files a motion to suppress  the exclusionary rule would prohibit the prosecution from offering the statement as proof of guilt  However  the statement can be used to impeach the defendant s testimony  Further  the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine does not apply  Since the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine does not apply to Miranda violations  the exclusionary rule exceptions  attenuation  independent source and inevitable discovery  do not come into play  Therefore  derivative evidence would be fully admissible  For example  the police continue with a custodial interrogation after the suspect has asserted his right to silence  During his post assertion statement the suspect tells the police the location of the gun he used in the murder  Following this information the police find the gun  Forensic testing identify the gun as the murder weapon and fingerprints lifted from the gun match the suspect s  The contents of the Miranda defective statement could not be offered by the prosecution as substantive evidence  but the gun itself and all related forensic evidence would not be subject to suppression   10  Procedural requirements  Although the rules vary by jurisdiction  generally a person who wishes to contest the admissibility of evidence on the grounds that it was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights must comply with the following procedural requirements   The defendant must file a motion   The motion must be in writing   The motion must be filed before trial   The motion must allege the factual and legal grounds on which the defendant seeks suppression of evidence   The motion must be supported by affidavits or other documentary evidence   The motion must be served on the state  Failure to comply with a procedural requirement may result in summary dismissal of the motion  If the defendant meets the procedural requirement  the motion will normally be considered by the judge outside the presence of the jury  The judge hears evidence  determines the facts  makes conclusions of law and enters an order allowing or denying the motion   11  Related doctrines  In addition to Miranda  confession may be challenged under the Massiah Doctrine  the Voluntariness Standard  Provisions of Federal and State rules of criminal procedure and State Constitutional provisions   11 1  Massiah Doctrine  The Massiah Doctrine prohibits the admission of a confession obtained in violation of the defendant s Sixth Amendment right to counsel  Specifically  the Massiah rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings deliberately elicited by the police from a defendant after formal charges have been filed  The events that trigger the sixth amendment safeguards under Massiah are  1  the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings and  2  deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents   The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant a right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions  The purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel are to protect a defendant s right to a fair trial and to assure that the adversarial system of justice functions properly by providing competent counsel as an advocate for the defendant in his contest against the  prosecutorial forces  of the state   11 1 1  Commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings  The Sixth Amendment right  attaches  once the government has committed itself to the prosecution of the case by the initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings  by way of formal charge  preliminary hearing  indictment  information or arraignment   Determining whether a particular event or proceeding constitutes the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings requires both an examination of the rules of criminal procedure for the jurisdiction in which the crime is charged and the Supreme Courts cases dealing with the issue of when formal prosecution begins  Once adversarial criminal proceedings commence the right to counsel applies to all critical stages of the prosecution and investigation  A critical stage is  any stage of the prosecution  formal or informal  in court or out  where counsel s absence might derogate from the accused s right to a fair trial    Government attempts to obtain incriminating statement related to the offense charged from the defendant by overt interrogation or surreptitious means is a critical stage and any information thus obtained is subject to suppression unless the government can show that an attorney was present or the defendant knowingly  voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel   11 1 2  Deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents  Deliberate elicitation is defined as the intentional creation of circumstances by government agents that are likely to produce incriminating information from the defendant  Clearly express questioning  interrogation  would qualify but the concept also extends to surreptitious attempts to acquire information from the defendant through the use of undercover agents or paid informants   The definition of  deliberate elicitation  is not the same as the definition of  interrogation  under the Miranda rule  Miranda interrogation includes express questioning and any actions or statements that an officer would reasonably foresee as likely to cause an incriminating response  Massiah applies to express questioning and any attempt to deliberately and intentionally obtain incriminating information from the defendant regarding the crime charged  The difference is purposeful creation of an environment likely to produce incriminating information  Massiah  and action likely to induce an incriminating response even if that was not the officer s purpose or intent  Miranda    The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense specific â€“ the right only applies to post commencement attempts to obtain information relating to the crime charged  The right does not extend to uncharged offenses if factually related to the charged crime   As noted  information obtained in violation of the defendant s Sixth Amendment right to counsel is subject to suppression unless the government can establish that the defendant waived his right to counsel  The waiver must be knowing  intelligent and voluntary  A valid Miranda waiver operates as a wavier of Sixth Amendment right   11 2  Miranda and Massiah compared  Constitutional basis   Miranda is based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent   Massiah is based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel   Attachment   Miranda  Custody + interrogation  charging status irrelevant    Massiah  Formally charged + deliberate elicitation  custodial status irrelevant    Scope   a  Miranda applies to custodial interrogation by known governmental agents  Surreptitious acquisition of incriminating information allowed   a  Massiah applies to overt and surreptitious interrogation   b  Miranda is not offense specific   b  Massiah is offense specific   c  Miranda  interrogation +  functional equivalent   c  Massiah  interrogation +  deliberate elicitation   Waiver  Both Miranda and Massiah rights may be waived   Assertion  In each case  the assertion must be clear and unequivocal  The effects of assertion are not identical  For purposes of Miranda  the police must immediately cease the interrogation and cannot resume interrogating the defendant about any offense charged or uncharged unless counsel is present or defendant initiates contact for purposes of resuming interrogation and valid waiver obtained  Because Massiah is offense specific  an assertion of the sixth amendment right to counsel requires the police to cease interrogating the defendant about any charged offense  Apparently the police could continue questioning the defendant about uncharged crimes assuming that the defendant was not in custody  The defendant s remedy would be to leave or to refuse to answer questions   Remedy for violation  The remedy for violation of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel is identical  the statements and testimonial information are subject to suppression  Derivative evidence is not subject to suppression under Miranda â€“ fruit of poisonous tree doctrine may apply to Massiah violation  Both Miranda and Massiah defective statements can be used for impeachment purposes   Exceptions  The primary exceptions to Miranda are  1  the routine booking questions exception  2  the jail house informant exception and  3  the public safety exception  In Moulton v  Maine the Supreme Court refused to recognize a public safety exception to the Massiah rule  Massiah allows for the use of jail house informants provided the informants serve merely as  passive listeners    11 3  The voluntariness standard  The voluntariness standard applies to all police interrogations regardless of the custodial status of the suspect and regardless of whether the suspect has been formally charged  The remedy for a violation of the standard is complete suppression of the statement and any evidence derived from the statement  The statement cannot be used as either substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant s testimony  The reason for the strictness is the common law s aversion to the use of coerced confessions because of their inherent unreliability  Further the rights to be free from coerced confession cannot be waived nor is it necessary that the victim of coercive police conduct assert his right  In considering the voluntariness standard one must consider the Supreme Court s decision in Colorado v  Connelly  Although federal courts  application of the Connelly rule has been inconsistent and state courts have often failed to appreciate the consequences of the case  Connelly clearly marked a significant change in the application of the voluntariness standard  Before Connelly the test was whether the confession was voluntary considering the totality of the circumstances   Voluntary  carried its everyday meaning  the confession had to be a product of the exercise of the defendant s free will rather than police coercion  After Connelly the totality of circumstances test is not even triggered unless the defendant can show coercive police conduct  Questions of free will and rational decision making are irrelevant to a due process claim unless police misconduct existed and a causal connection can be shown between the misconduct and the confession   11 4  State constitutional challenges  Every state constitution has articles and provision guaranteeing individual rights  In most cases the subject matter is similar to the federal bill of rights  Most state courts interpretation of their constitution is consistent with the interpretation federal court s of analogous provisions of the federal constitution  With regard to Miranda issues  state courts have exhibited significant resistance to incorporating into their state jurisprudence some of the limitations on the Miranda rule that have been created by the federal courts  As a consequence a defendant may be able to circumvent the federal limitation on the Miranda rule and successfully challenge the admissibility under state constitutional provisions  Practically every aspect of the Miranda rule has drawn state court criticism  However the primary point of contention involve the following limitations on the scope of the Miranda rule   1  the Harris exception  2  the Burbine rule and  3  the Fare rule   11 5  State statutory challenges  In addition to constitutionally based challenge  states permit a defendant to challenge the admissibility of a confession on the grounds that the confession was obtained in violation of a defendant s statutory rights  For example  North Carolina Criminal Procedure Act permits a defendant to move to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a  substantial  violation of the provision of the North Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure   12  Confusion regarding use  Due to the prevalence of American television programs and motion pictures in which the police characters frequently read suspects their rights  it has become an expected element of arrest procedureâ€”in the 2000 Dickerson decision  Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that Miranda warnings had  become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture    While arrests and interrogations can legally occur without the Miranda warning being given  this procedure would generally make the arrestee s pre Miranda statements inadmissible at trial   However  pursuant to the plurality opinion in United States v  Patane  physical evidence obtained as a result of pre Miranda statements may still be admitted  There was no majority opinion of the Court in that case    In some jurisdictions  a detention differs at law from an arrest  and police are not required to give the Miranda warning until the person is arrested for a crime  In those situations  a person s statements made to police are generally admissible even though the person was not advised of their rights  Similarly  statements made while an arrest is in progress before the Miranda warning was given or completed are also generally admissible   Because Miranda applies only to custodial interrogations  it does not protect detainees from standard booking questions such as name and address  Because it is a protective measure intended to safeguard the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination  it does not prevent the police from taking blood without a warrant from persons suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol   Such evidence may be self incriminatory  but are not considered statements of self incrimination    If an inmate is in jail and invoked Miranda on one case  it is unclear whether this extends to any other cases that they may be charged with while in custody  For example  a subject is arrested  charged with cattle rustling  and is held in county jail awaiting trial  He invoked his Miranda rights on the cow case  While in custody  he is involved in a fight where a staff member loses his ability to walk  He speaks to the custodial staff regarding the fight without staff first invoking Miranda  It is unclear if this statement is admissible because of the original Miranda statement   Many police departments give special training to interrogators with regard to the Miranda warning  specifically  how to influence a suspect s decision to waive the right  For instance  the officer may be required to specifically ask if the rights are understood and if the suspect wishes to talk  The officer is allowed  before asking the suspect a question  to speak at length about evidence collected  witness statements  etc  The officer will then ask if the suspect wishes to talk  and the suspect is then more likely to talk in an attempt to refute the evidence presented  Another tactic commonly taught is never to ask a question  the officer may simply sit the suspect down in an interrogation room  sit across from him and do paperwork  and wait for the suspect to begin talking  These tactics are intended to mitigate the restrictions placed on law officers against compelling a suspect to give evidence  and have stood up in court as valid lawful tactics  Nevertheless  such tactics are condemned by legal rights groups as deceptive   12 1  Exemption for interrogations conducted by undercover agents  In Illinois v  Perkins  496 U S  292  1990   the United States Supreme Court held that undercover officers do not have to give suspects a Miranda warning prior to asking questions that may elicit incriminating responses  In this case  an undercover agent posed as an inmate and carried on a 35 minute conversation with another inmate that he suspected of committing a murder that was being investigated  During this conversation  the suspect implicated himself in the murder that the undercover agent was investigating   The Supreme Court came to this conclusion despite the government s admission that a custodial interrogation had been conducted by a government agent   12 2  Report of warnings being given to detainees in Afghanistan  Beginning in 2009  some detainees captured in Afghanistan have been read their Miranda rights by the FBI  according to Congressman Michael Rogers of Michigan  who claims to have witnessed this himself  According to the Justice Department   There has been no policy change nor blanket instruction for FBI agents to Mirandize detainees overseas  While there have been specific cases in which FBI agents have Mirandized suspects overseas at both Bagram and in other situations  in order to preserve the quality of evidence obtained  there has been no overall policy change with respect to detainees    13  Equivalent rights in other countries  13 1  Australia  Within Australia  the right to silence derives from common law  The uniform position amongst the states is that neither the judge nor the jury is permitted to draw any adverse inference about the defendant s culpability  where he she does not answer police questions  RPS v R  2000  199 CLR 620     overturning Jones v Dunkel  1959  101 CLR 298   While this is the common law position  it is buttressed by various legislative provisions within the states  For instance s 464J of the Crimes Act 1958  Vic  and s 89 of the Evidence Act 1995  NSW    It has also been upheld by the High Court in the case of Petty v R  1991  173 CLR 95  However  where a defendant answers some police questions  but not others  an inference may sometimes be drawn about the questions he refused to answer   See Coldrey  below    The current caution used in New South Wales is   The current caution used in Queensland is   Where a defendant refuses to speak to the police  but then speaks to an undercover member of the police  the court is likely to exclude that evidence to ensure that the police do not avoid their limitations  However  if a defendant speaks to a person who is not a member of the police  and who is fitted with a listening device  that evidence would be admitted  Queen v Swaffield  Pavic v The Queen  1998  192 CLR   Australian research indicates that very few suspects actually refuse to speak  Stevenson s research  see below for citation  indicates that only 4% of suspects who are subsequently charged and tried in the District Court of New South Wales in Sydney remain silent during interviews  The Victorian DPP found that 7â€“9% of suspects refused to answer police questions   A number of states have conducted enquiries into the adoption of the English changes set out in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994  All states have rejected such change  As the NSW Report said   It is also important to note that anything said to an Australian police member should be corroborated  especially by way of video or audio tape  If it is not so corroborated it will be admitted only under exceptional circumstances  S 464H  2  a  of the Crimes Act 1958  Vic   and where the circumstances  on the balance of probabilities  justify the reception of the evidence  S 464H  2  b  of the Crimes Act 1958  Vic   While initially the police were insulted by this ruling most have now come to find it useful as a way of proving that they did not invent a false  verbal confession  never made by an accused  a practice called  verballing  an accused    13 2  Bangladesh  Article 33 of the Constitution of Bangladesh compels arresting authorities to inform the accused of the accusations brought against him before he is detained  and that the detained must be presented to the nearest court within 24 hours  Exceptions to this rule include preventive detention and the arrest of an enemy alien  Right to counsel is an inalienable right  but the arresting officer need not explicitly state it to the detained   Article 35 4  of the Constitution protects individuals from self implication  Therefore  Miranda warnings must be read out to the detained if he wants to voluntarily confess to the charges  in this case  a Magistrate must read and explain the confessor s right to silence and protection from self implication  and attest to the fact that the rights of the confessor were read out to him and explained  and the confessor waived his right of silence   13 3  Canada  In Canada  equivalent rights exist pursuant to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms  Under the Charter  an arrested person has the right   To be informed promptly of the reasons therefor   To retain and instruct counsel without delay and be informed of that right   To have the validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful  The Canadian Charter warning reads  varies by police service    You are under arrest for            charge   do you understand  You have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay  We will provide you with a toll free telephone lawyer referral service  if you do not have your own lawyer  Anything you say can be used in court as evidence  Do you understand  Would you like to speak to a lawyer    See  R  v  Hebert  1990  2 S C R  151    A more detailed version   I am arresting you for  charge   It is my duty to inform you that you have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay  You may call any lawyer you want  There is a 24 hour telephone service available which provides a legal aid duty lawyer who can give you legal advice in private  This advice is given without charge and the lawyer can explain the legal aid plan to you  If you wish to contact a legal aid duty lawyer  I can provide you with a telephone number  Do you understand  Do you want to call a lawyer  You are not obliged to say anything  but anything you do say may be given in evidence   See  Brydgesa fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal  s  11 d    Section 14 of the Charter further provides that a translator must be made available so that the person can understand the proceedings against them  This right to a translator extends to the deaf   While Section 7 of the Charter guarantees the right to remain silent  Canadian law does not entitle the criminal suspect to have counsel present during the course of an interrogation  Once a suspect has asserted their right to counsel  the police are obliged to hold off in attempting to obtain evidence until the suspect has had a reasonable opportunity to contact legal counsel  however suspects do not have the right to have counsel present during the questioning  Also  in Canada even if the suspect emphatically asserts his decision to remain silent  the police may continue to interrogate him  Although this may give the suspect the impression that his claim of the right to silence is meaningless or that he has no such right  it is perfectly legal  In R  v  Singh  163 C R R   2d  280   the suspect invoked his right to remain silent 18 times and the police nevertheless continued to question him after each assertion of his right  but the Supreme Court of Canada found this consistent with Canada s Charter rights protections   13 4  European Union  Within the European Union  a gradual process of harmonising the laws of all the states of the Union has resulted in the adoption a common letter of rights that will apply to everyone across the European Union  The agreed lawâ€”also known as  the Reding Rights  taking the name of the EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding  who has proposed and negotiated the measure to become law across the entire European Unionâ€”will mean that suspects in the European Union will once detained receive a  letter of rights listing their basic rights during criminal proceedings   The European law ensures that people suspected of a criminal offence receive adequate information about their basic rights during criminal proceedings  These are the right to a lawyer  to be informed of the charge  to interpretation and translation for those who do not understand the language of the proceedings  the right to remain silent and to be brought promptly before a court following arrest   In particular  the law includes five innovations   Suspects will be informed of their rights following the arrest  They will be given a  letter of rights  spelling out their rights in writing  The letter of rights will be easy to understand  without legal jargon  It will be made available in a language the suspect understands  It will contain practical details about the person s rights  These rights are contained in a letter of rightsâ€” the Reding Rights â€”a printed document given to suspects after they are detained and before interrogation  The European Union law  proposed in July 2010 by the European Commission  was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in December 2011  The European Union Directive was published officially on 1 June 2012 in the Official Journal of the European Union L 142  1 6 2012  It will become operational across the European Union by 2 June 2014   13 4 1  England and Wales  Warnings regarding the right against self incrimination may have originated in England and Wales  In 1912  the judges of the King s Bench issued the Judges  Rules  These provided that  when a police member had admissible evidence to suspect a person of an offence and wished to question that suspect about an offence  the officer should first caution the person that he was entitled to remain silent  However  the warning about the possibility of anything the suspect said being potentially used against him predates even that  it appears for example in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle s novel The Sign of the Four  published in 1890  Chapter 6  Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration     as well as G  K  Chesterton s novel The Ball and the Cross  published in 1909  Chapter X   The Swords Rejoined     The pre trial operation of the privilege against self incrimination was further buttressed by the decision in Ibrahim v R  1914  AC 599 that an admission or confession made by the accused to the police would only be admissible in evidence if the prosecution could establish that it had been voluntary  An admission or confession is only voluntary if made in the exercise of a free choice about whether to speak or remain silent   In R v Leckey  1943  CAR 128 the Court of Criminal Appeal said   Therefore a caution of the form of   was used  Major reform to the questioning and treatment of suspected offenders occurred in 1984 when the Police and Criminal Evidence Act came into force  Under Code C the right to silence was amended by allowing adverse inferences to be drawn at a court hearing in cases where a suspect refuses to explain something  and then later produces an explanation  see right to silence in England and Wales   In other words the jury is entitled to infer that the accused fabricated the explanation at a later date  as he refused to provide the explanation during police questioning  The jury is also free to make no such inference  The new caution is   You do not have to say anything  but it may harm your defence if you do not mention  when questioned  something which you later rely on in court  Anything you do say may be given in evidence  If questioning is forthcoming   when questioned  may be substituted with  now   In cases in which the suspect has clearly nothing to gain by failing to remain silent   Anything you do say may  and will  be given in evidence  or   You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so  but I must warn you that if you fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court  your failure to take this opportunity to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you  If you do wish to say anything  what you say may be given in evidence  or even  in circumstances where no adverse inference can be drawn from silence    You do not have to say anything  but anything you do say may be given in evidence  The caution in England and Wales does not explicitly require that a suspect affirm they understand the caution  In addition the caution need not be explicitly stated if it is obvious that the suspect is already aware of his rights  for example if he is a police officer  as long as the suspect is definitely aware that he is under caution  Furthermore the invoking of that right does not prohibit officers from asking further questions   13 4 2  France  In France  any person brought in police custody   Garde Ã  vue   must be informed of the maximal duration of the custody  and a number of rights  in a language that this person understands  Among these rights are  the possibility of warning a relative or employer of the custody  that of asking to be examined by a physician  and that of discussing the case with an attorney   Since 15 April 2011  any person held by the police has new rights   The person is immediately informed by a police officer  or in the presence of one  in a language that he can understand  that  Article 3    he has the right to ask assistance of a lawyer  63 3 1 Ã  63 4 3 of Penal Procedure code    he has the right  after answering questions about his identity  to answer other questions or to remain silent   From the beginning of custody  the person can ask for the assistance of a lawyer  Article 6    The conversation with the lawyer has to remain confidential  Article 7    The lawyer has the right to access some of the documents related to the procedure and to be present at any police interview of the suspect made by the police  Article 8   In cases of terrorism and narcotrafficking  however  the individual may not consult with an attorney until the 72nd hour of detention  Further  criminal suspects in garde Ã  vue  i e   custody  do not have to be informed of their right to remain silent   Witnesses under indictment  or who are cited as suspects  cannot be heard under oath  and thus do not risk prosecution for perjury  Such witnesses must be assisted by an attorney  and must be informed of these rights when heard by the judiciary  Suspects brought before a Juge d instruction must be informed of their right to remain silent  to make statements  or to answer questions  In all cases  an attorney can be designated by the head of the bar if necessary   13 4 3  Germany  According to Â§ 136 StPO  Strafprozessordnung  or  Criminal Procedure Code     Before any interrogation begins a suspect  arrested or not  must be informed   Of the crime for which he is charged  About his right to remain silent  About his right to consult an attorney before the interview  About his right to name any evidence in his favour Though the courts may not draw inference from the complete silence of the accused in any stage of criminal proceedings  inference may be drawn if the accused is selectively silent   Foreign suspects have the following additional rights   Translation assistance  and  Consular assistance  13 4 4  Netherlands  According to the Dutch law  only the police officer will read the rights of the suspect in the police station  Security guards have the right to put somebody under arrest  but they have to hand over the suspect immediately to the police officer who will read the rights of the suspect later in the station  The rights are  to remain silent  the right to have an attorney  the right to have access to some files coming from the criminal dossier  and the right to make contact to an attorney   13 4 5  Spain  In Spain  according to the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal  Penal procedure code  article 520 2  the suspect must be informed of the charges leading to his detention  as well as the reasons for being deprived of his freedom  Additionally  the individual must be advised of the following rights   Right to remain silent  to answer only questions of his choosing  or to express their desire to make a statement only in front of a judge   Right not to give evidence against himself  as well as not to confess his guilt   Right to legal representation by a private or state funded attorney  which will assist him during hearings and procedures   Right to inform a member of his family or a person of his choosing regarding the detention as well as their location  at any moment of the proceedings  Foreigners have the right to contact their consulate in Spain   Right to request the services of an interpreter  at no cost  when the foreign national does not speak Spanish   Right to undergo a medical examination by the forensic doctor   13 5  Hong Kong  The right to silence is protected according to common law  The  Rules and Directions for the Questioning of Suspects and the Taking of Statements   Rules and Directions   promulgated by the then Attorney General in 1992  stipulate that the caution to be used to remind a suspect of his right to remain silent when he is questioned  The statement can be read in English  Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese   English  This is the same caution given in England and Wales Prior to the passage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994   13 6  Israel  In Israel  according to Sections 28  Hearing arguments of the detainee  and Section 31  Explanation of rights to the detainee  of the Criminal Procedure Law  Enforcement Authorityâ€”Arrests  1996  an officer interrogating arresting a suspect must duly warn him first that he does not have to say any thing that may incriminate him  and that any thing he will say may be used against him  According to Israeli law  the exercise of the right to remain silent may be considered as supplemental evidence in most cases  and this fact also needs to be explained to the suspect  Also the officer needs to inform the suspect that he has the right to notify a family member or acquaintance and a lawyer of his arrest  his right for counsel  and the duration he can be held before he is released or brought before a judge   Israeli law has not adopted the  Fruits of the Poisoned Tree  doctrine  and flaws in the process of collecting it affect only the weight of tainted evidence  However  in Criminal Appeal 5121 98  Issaharov v  The Military Prosecutor  a court of nine ruled that the defendant s confession  given without proper warning regarding the right of representation  was not considered as given with consent and free will  and was not accepted by the court   13 7  New Zealand  Within New Zealand  the caution is mandated by Section 23 of the Bill of Rights Act 1990  and a practice note on police questioning issued in 2006  by then Chief Justice Sian Elias  The obligation to caution arises when   a suspect is in custody   when police have enough evidence to believe the person has committed an offence   when detained  such as for the execution of a statutory or common law power of search or in the execution of drink driving investigations   other situations as dictated by statute or case law  The caution to be given is   13 8  Philippines  In the Philippines  the National Police has rules in arresting that oblige the officer to give a specific warning  The following are translations of the original Tagalog phrases used in the official warning   You have the right to be silent   The things you will say may be used as evidence against you in court   You have the right to obtain a lawyer  If you cannot obtain a lawyer  the court  shall be the one to  appoint  one  for you   13 9  South Africa  The Constitution of South Africa requires that any arrested person be informed of their right to remain silent and the consequences of not remaining silent  their right to choose and consult with a legal practitioner  and their right to have a legal practitioner assigned to the detained person by the state and at state expense if substantial injustice would otherwise result  The South African Police Service rules prescribe that arrested people be given a Form 14A  Notice of Rights in Terms of the Constitution  which describes these and other rights of arrested people   13 10  Switzerland  Article 158 of the unified Swiss code of criminal procedure  which is to enter into force by 2011  establishes that the results of an interrogation may not be used unless the accused has been informed that   he she is the subject of a criminal investigation for some specific infractions   he she has the right to remain silent and not to cooperate with police   he she has the right to legal representation by a private or state funded attorney  and  he she has the right to request the services of an interpreter  The cantonal codes of procedure  which remain in force until 2011  generally contain similar provisions   13 11  Thailand  Sections 83 and 84 of the Thai Code of Criminal Procedure  which have been amended by the Act Amending the Criminal Procedure Code  No  22   BE 2547  2004   require the police officers who conduct the arrests to inform the arrestees of the Miranda rights   Paragraph two of section 83 reads   In cases an arrest is conducted by an officer  the officer must inform the arrestee of the charge  produce to him a warrant of arrest  if any  and enlighten him that he has the right to remain silent  that anything he says can and will be used as evidence in a trial  and that he also has the right to meet and confer with a counsel or person to become his counsel  If the arrestee wishes to inform his relative or intimate of his arrest and the fulfillment of his wish would not be difficult and not be disruptive to his arrest or restraint or detrimental to any person  the officer shall allow the arrestee to so fulfill to the extent reasonable according to the circumstances  In this respect  the arresting officer shall also draw up a record of arrest  While paragraph one of section 84 prescribes   An officer or private citizen conducting an arrest must without delay bring the arrestee to the judicial police office under section 83  Upon arriving there  the arrestee must be delivered to an administrative or police officer thereof to further be dealt with as follows   2  In cases the arrest is conducted by a private citizen  the administrative or police officer receiving the arrestee shall draw up a record of the name  occupation and address of the citizen  including the information and circumstances as to the arrest as well  and require the citizen to sign such record  The officer shall then inform the arrestee of the charge and detailed grounds for his arrest  and enlighten him that he has the right to remain silent and anything he says can and will be used as evidence in a trial   13 12  Ukraine  Section 4 of Article 29 of Constitution of Ukraine reads   Everyone arrested or detained shall be informed without delay of the reasons for his or her arrest or detention  apprised of his or her rights  and from the moment of detention shall be given the opportunity to personally defend himself or herself  or to have the legal assistance of a defender  The Criminal Process Code of Ukraine has some regulations on how the rights of suspects and accused  Section 2 of Article 21 reads   Inquirer  investigator  prosecutor  judge  and court  before the first examination of the suspect  accused  and defendant  are required to advise them of the right to have a defense counsel and draw up an appropriate record thereon  as well as provide the suspect  accused  and defendant the possibility to defend themselves with legal remedies from the charge brought and ensure protection of their personal and property rights  Article 43 1  Section 1 gives the following definition of  suspect    The following person is considered to be a suspect  1  a person apprehended on the suspicion of having committed a crime  2  a person in whose respect a measure of restraint has been imposed before the decision to prosecute him her has been made  Consequently  the list of suspect s rights follows   The suspect has the right to  know what he she is suspected of  give testimonies or refuse testifying and answering questions  have a defense counsel and meet him her before the first examination  produce evidence  submit motions and propose disqualifications  request that the court or prosecutor verify legality of the apprehension  submit complaints against actions and decisions of the officer who conducts operational detective activities  inquirer  investigator  and prosecutor  and  with appropriate grounds present  have his her security ensured  The fact that the suspect was advised of his her rights is entered into the record of apprehension or decision to impose a measure of restraint  Article 53 contains the following regulation   Court  prosecutor  investigator and the inquirer are required to advice participants to the case of their rights and to ensure the possibility to enjoy such rights  However  there are no clear regulations on how the rights should be announced  This is commonly made by reading them out when announcing the decision on instituting criminal proceedings or arrest and then requiring a suspect or arrestee to sign the list of these rights   14  See also  Arrest  Civil rights  Criminal justice  Garrity Warning  Joe Jacquot  Kalkines Warning  Right to silence  Uniform Code of Military
