Adobe Flash  formerly called Macromedia Flash and Shockwave Flash  is a multimedia and software platform used for creating vector graphics  animation  games and rich Internet applications  RIAs  that can be viewed  played and executed in Adobe Flash Player  Flash is frequently used to add streamed video or audio players  advertisement and interactive multimedia content to web pages  although usage of Flash on websites is declining   Flash manipulates vector and raster graphics to provide animation of text  drawings  and still images  It allows bidirectional streaming of audio and video  and it can capture user input via mouse  keyboard  microphone and camera  Flash applications and animations can be programmed using the object oriented language called ActionScript  Adobe Flash Professional is the most popular authoring tool for creating the Flash content  which also allows automation via the JavaScript Flash language  JSFL   Adobe s attempt to foster open source Flash development appears to have been abandoned   Adobe Flash Player makes the Flash content accessible on various operating systems such as Windows  OS X and Linux  and is available free of charge for common web browsers  as a plug in  under a few of the major operating systems  some smartphones and tablets  and a few other electronic devices using Flash Lite   1  History  Flash originated with the application SmartSketch  developed by Jonathan Gay  It was published by FutureWave Software  which was founded by Charlie Jackson  SmartSketch was a drawing application for pen computers running the PenPoint OS  When PenPoint failed in the marketplace  SmartSketch was ported to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS  As the Internet became more popular  FutureWave added cell animation editing to the vector drawing capabilities of SmartSketch and released FutureSplash Animator on multiple platforms  FutureWave approached Adobe Systems with an offer to sell them FutureSplash in 1995  but Adobe turned them down at that time  FutureSplash was used by Microsoft in its early work with the Internet  MSN   and also by Disney Online for their subscription based service Disney s Daily Blast  In 1996  FutureSplash was acquired by Macromedia and released as Flash  Flash is currently developed and distributed by Adobe Systems  as the result of its 2005 purchase of Macromedia   Adobe Flash Professional is one of the common animation programs for low cost 2D television and commercial animation  in competition with Anime Studio and Toon Boom Animation  Notable users of the software include DHX Media Vancouver for productions including Pound Puppies and My Little Pony  Friendship is Magic  Fresh TV for Total Drama  Nelvana for 6teen and Clone High  Williams Street for Metalocalypse and Squidbillies  and Nickelodeon Animation Studios for Wow  Wow  Wubbzy  El Tigre  The Adventures of Manny Rivera  Danny Phantom and Happy Tree Friends  Flash is less commonly used for feature length animated films  however  2009 s The Secret of Kells  an Irish film  was animated primarily in Adobe Flash  and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 82nd Academy Awards   2  Format  2 1  FLA  Flash source files are in the FLA format  and contain graphics  animation as well as embedded assets such as bitmap images  audio files and FLV video files  The Flash source file format is a proprietary format and Adobe Flash Professional is the only available authoring tool capable of editing such files  Flash source files   fla  may be compiled into Flash movie files   swf  using Flash Professional   2 2  SWF  Flash movie files are in the SWF format  traditionally called  ShockWave Flash  movies   Flash movies   or  Flash applications   usually have a  swf file extension  and may be used in the form of a web page plug in  strictly  played  in a standalone Flash Player  or incorporated into a self executing Projector movie  with the  exe extension in Microsoft Windows   Flash Video files have a  flv file extension and are either used from within  swf files or played through a flv aware player  such as VLC  or QuickTime and Windows Media Player with external codecs added   The use of vector graphics combined with program code allows Flash files to be smaller—and thus allows streams to use less bandwidth—than the corresponding bitmaps or video clips  For content in a single format  such as just text  video  or audio   other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less CPU power than the corresponding Flash movie  for example when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades   In addition to a vector rendering engine  the Flash Player includes a virtual machine called the ActionScript Virtual Machine  AVM  for scripting interactivity at run time  with video  MP3 based audio  and bitmap graphics  As of Flash Player 8  it offers two video codecs  On2 Technologies VP6 and Sorenson Spark  and run time JPEG  Progressive JPEG  PNG  and GIF capability  In the next version  Flash is slated to use a just in time compiler for the ActionScript engine   2 3  3D  Flash Player 11 introduced a full 3D shader API  called Stage3D  which is fairly similar to WebGL   2 4  Flash Video  Virtually all browser plugins for video are free of charge and cross platform  including Adobe s offering of Flash Video  which was first introduced with Flash version 6  Flash Video has been a popular choice for websites due to the large installed user base and programmability of Flash  In 2010  Apple publicly criticized Adobe Flash  including its implementation of video playback for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration  one reason Flash is not to be found on Apple s mobile devices  Soon after Apple s criticism  Adobe demoed and released a beta version of Flash 10 1  which takes advantage of GPU hardware acceleration even on a Mac  Flash 10 2 beta  released December 2010  adds hardware acceleration for the whole video rendering pipeline   2 5  Flash Audio  Flash Audio is most commonly encoded in MP3 or AAC  Advanced Audio Coding  however it can also use ADPCM  Nellymoser  Nellymoser Asao Codec  and Speex audio codecs  Flash allows sample rates of 11  22 and 44 1 kHz  It cannot have 48 kHz audio sample rate  which is the standard TV and DVD sample rate   On August 20  2007  Adobe announced on its blog that with Update 3 of Flash Player 9  Flash Video will also implement some parts of the MPEG 4 international standards  Specifically  Flash Player will work with video compressed in H 264  MPEG 4 Part 10   audio compressed using AAC  MPEG 4 Part 3   the F4V  MP4  MPEG 4 Part 14   M4V  M4A  3GP and MOV multimedia container formats  3GPP Timed Text specification  MPEG 4 Part 17   which is a standardized subtitle format and partial parsing capability for the  ilst  atom  which is the ID3 equivalent iTunes uses to store metadata  MPEG 4 Part 2 and H 263 will not work in F4V file format  Adobe also announced that it will be gradually moving away from the FLV format to the standard ISO base media file format  MPEG 4 Part 12  owing to functional limits with the FLV structure when streaming H 264  The final release of the Flash Player implementing some parts of MPEG 4 standards had become available in Fall 2007   Adobe Flash Player 10 1 does not have acoustic echo cancellation  unlike the VoIP offerings of Skype and Google Voice  making this and earlier versions of Flash less suitable for group calling or meetings  Flash Player 10 3 Beta incorporates acoustic echo cancellation   2 6  Scripting language  ActionScript is the programming language used by Flash  It is an enhanced superset of the ECMAScript programming language  with a classical Java style class model  rather than JavaScript s prototype model   2 7  Specifications  In October 1998  Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification on its website  It did this in response to many new and often semi open formats competing with SWF  such as Xara s Flare and Sharp s Extended Vector Animation formats  Several developers quickly created a C library for producing SWF  In February 1999  MorphInk 99 was introduced  the first third party program to create SWF files  Macromedia also hired Middlesoft to create a freely available developers  kit for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5   Macromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a non disclosure agreement  but they are widely available from various sites   In April 2006  the Flash SWF file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format  Flash 8   Although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats  On2  Sorenson Spark  etc    this new documentation covered all the new features offered in Flash v8 including new ActionScript commands  expressive filter controls  and so on  The file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the Flash file format  The license forbids the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of Flash files  The Flash 9 specification was made available under similar restrictions   In June 2009  Adobe launched the Open Screen Project     which made the SWF specification available without restrictions  Previously  developers could not use the specification for making SWF compatible players  but only for making SWF exporting authoring software  The specification still omits information on codecs such as Sorenson Spark  however   3  Authoring tools  3 1  Official tools  The Adobe Flash Professional authoring program is primarily used to design graphics and animation and publish the same for websites  web applications  and video games  The program also offers limited support for audio and video embedding  and ActionScript scripting   Adobe provides four ways of developing software applications for Flash   Adobe Flash Builder  enterprise application development & debugging   Adobe Scout  visual profiler for performance optimization   Adobe Flex SDK  a free SDK to compile Flash applications from source code   CrossBridge  a free SDK to cross compile C++ code to run in Flash Player   3 2  Third party tools  Open source projects like Ajax Animator aim to create a Flash development environment  complete with a graphical user environment  Alternatively  programs such as Vectorian Giotto  swfmill  SWFTools  and MTASC provide tools to create SWF files  but do so by compiling text  ActionScript or XML files into Flash animations  It is also possible to create SWF files programmatically using the Ming library  which has interfaces for C  PHP  C++  Perl  Python  and Ruby  Haxe is an open source  high level object oriented programming language geared towards web content creation that can compile Flash files   Many shareware developers produced Flash creation tools and sold them for under US$50 between 2000 and 2002  In 2003 competition and the emergence of free Flash creation tools had driven many third party Flash creation tool makers out of the market  allowing the remaining developers to raise their prices  although many of the products still cost less than US$100 and work with ActionScript  As for open source tools  KToon can edit vectors and generate SWF  but its interface is very different from Macromedia s  Another  more recent example of a Flash creation tool is SWiSH Max made by an ex employee of Macromedia  Toon Boom Technologies also sells a traditional animation tool  based on Flash   In addition  several programs create  swf compliant files as output from their programs  Among the best known of these is Screencast  which leverages the ability to do lossless compression and playback of captured screen content to produce demos  tutorials  or software simulations of programs  These programs are typically designed for use by non programmers  and create Flash content quickly and easily  but cannot actually edit the underlying Flash code  i e  the tweening and transforms  etc    Screencam is perhaps the oldest screencasting authoring tool to adopt Flash as the preferred output format  having been developed since the mid 90s  The fact that screencasting programs have adopted Flash as the preferred output is testament to Flash s presence as a ubiquitous cross platform animation file format   Other tools focus on creating specific types of Flash content  GoAnimate is a cloud based platform for creating and distributing high quality animated videos  Anime Studio is a 2D animation software package specialized for character animation that creates SWF files  Express Animator is similarly aimed specifically at animators  Question Writer publishes its quizzes to Flash file format   Users who are not programmers or web designers will also find on line tools that allow them to build full Flash based websites  One of the oldest services available  1998  is   Such companies provide a wide variety of pre built models  templates  associated to a Content Management System that empowers users to easily build  edit and publish their websites  Other sites  that allows greater customization and design flexibility are Wix com and CirclePad   Adobe wrote a software package called Adobe LiveMotion  designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats  including SWF  LiveMotion went through two major releases  but failed to gain any notable user base   In February 2003  Macromedia purchased Presedia  which had developed a Flash authoring tool that automatically converted PowerPoint files into Flash  Macromedia subsequently released the new product as Breeze  which included many new enhancements  In addition   as of version 2  Apple s Keynote presentation software also allows users to create interactive presentations and export to SWF   Since software applications can be built on Adobe Flash  third party development tools have been created to assist developers in doing so  FlashDevelop is a free and open source Flash ActionScript IDE  which includes a project manager and debugger for building applications on Flash Player and Adobe AIR  FDT by PowerFlasher Solutions is a commercial ActionScript IDE similar to FlashDevelop   4  Players  4 1  Adobe Flash Player  Adobe Flash Player is a multimedia and application player originally developed by Macromedia and acquired by Adobe Systems  It plays SWF files  which can be created by Adobe Flash Professional  Apache Flex  or a number of other Adobe Systems and 3rd party tools  It has support for a scripting language called ActionScript  which can be used to display Flash Video from an SWF file   4 2  SwfDec  Swfdec is an outdated free open source replacement of Adobe Flash Player  It run on Linux and FreeBSD and is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License  LGPL   The last release was on    4 3  Shumway  Shumway is an open source Flash Player released by Mozilla in November 2012  It is built in JavaScript and is thus compatible with modern web browsers  In early October 2013  Shumway was included by default in the Firefox nightly branch  and is planned to be initially included in a stable version of Firefox in the first half of 2014   4 4  Gnash  Gnash is an active project that aims to create a software player and browser plugin replacement for the Adobe Flash Player  Despite potential patent worries because of the proprietary nature of the files involved  Gnash provides most SWF features but does not fully support SWF v7  SWF v8 files  or the  9 th generation  Gnash runs on Windows  Linux and other platforms for the 32 bit  64 bit  and other operating systems   4 5  Lightspark  Lightspark is a free and open source SWF player  It implements the latest ActionScript 3  Lightspark supports OpenGL based rendering for 3D content  The player is compatible with H 264 Flash videos on YouTube   4 6  ScaleForm  Scaleform GFx is a commercial alternative Flash player that features fully hardware accelerated 2D graphics rendering using the GPU  Scaleform has high conformance with both Flash 10 ActionScript 3 and Flash 8 ActionScript 2  Scaleform GFx is a game development middleware solution that helps create graphical user interfaces or HUDs within 3D video games   5  Criticisms  5 1  Vendor dependence  The reliance on Adobe for decoding Flash makes its use on the World Wide Web a concern for advocates of open standards and free software — the completeness of its public specifications are debated  and no complete implementation of Flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse  Generally  public specifications are what makes a format re implementable  see future proofing data storage   and reusable codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator   Adobe s restrictions on the use of the SWF FLV specifications were lifted in February 2009  see Adobe s Open Screen Project   However  despite efforts of projects like Gnash  Swfdec and Lightspark  a complete free Flash player is yet to be seen  as of September 2011  For example  Gnash cannot use SWF v10 yet  Notably  Gnash has been a long standing high priority project of the Free Software Foundation  since at least 2007 and it was ranked number one in September 2011   Notable advocates of free software  open standards  and the World Wide Web have warned against the use of Flash   Founder of Mozilla Europe  Tristan Nitot stated in 2008   Companies building websites should beware of proprietary rich media technologies like Adobe s Flash and Microsoft s Silverlight        You re producing content for your users and there s someone in the middle deciding whether users should see your content  Representing open standards  inventor of CSS and co author of HTML5  Håkon Wium Lie explained in a Google tech talk of 2007  entitled  the `videob element   the proposal of Theora as the format for HTML5 video   I believe very strongly  that we need to agree on some kind of baseline video format if  the video element  is going to succeed  Flash is today the baseline format on the web  The problem with Flash is that it s not an open standard  Representing the free software movement  Richard Stallman stated in a speech in 2004 that   The use of Flash in websites is a major problem for our community    5 2  Availability on desktop operating systems  Adobe Flash Player has been released for a variety of desktop operating systems  including Windows  Mac OS X  and Linux  In 2011  Adobe claimed that 99% of desktop PCs had Flash Player installed   As of May 2011  users of computers with the PowerPC processor are not able to view Flash content from some sites  e g  Facebook  that requires the latest upgrade of Adobe Flash player  which is not compatible with this processor architecture   In February 2012  Adobe announced the discontinuation of its NPAPI Flash plugin for Linux from version 11 2  Newer versions will not be available from Adobe  but integrated with Google Chrome  using its PPAPI instead  Security updates for the NPAPI version will still be provided for 5 years   Since version 11 of Adobe Flash Player  released October 4  2011  64 bit and 32 bit builds for Windows  Mac and Linux have been released in sync  Previously  Adobe offered experimental 64 bit builds of Flash Player for Linux  from November 11  2008 to June 15  2010   5 3  Availability on mobile operating systems  Adobe Flash Player has been released for a variety of mobile operating systems  including Android  between versions 2 2 and 4 0 4   Pocket PC Windows CE  QNX  e g  on BlackBerry PlayBook   Symbian  Palm OS  and webOS  since version 2 0    Flash Player for smart phones was made available to handset manufacturers at the end of 2009   Adobe stops supporting Flash Player for mobile device browsers after the release of 11 1  It continues to support deploying Flash based content as mobile applications via Adobe AIR   In November 2011  however  Adobe announced the withdrawal of support for Flash on mobile devices  Adobe is reaffirming its commitment to  aggressively contribute  to HTML5  In November 2011 there were also a number of announcements that demonstrated a possible decline in demand for rich Internet application architectures  and Flash in particular  Adobe announced the end of Flash for mobile platforms or TV  instead focusing on HTML5 for browser content and Adobe AIR for the various mobile application stores  Pundits questioned its continued relevance even on the desktop and described it as  the beginning of the end   BlackBerry LTD  formerly known as RIM  announced that it would continue to develop Flash for the PlayBook   There is no Adobe Flash Player for iOS devices  iPhone  iPad and iPod Touch   However  Flash content can be made to run on iOS devices in a variety of ways   Flash content can be bundled inside an Adobe AIR app  which will then run on iOS devices   Apple did not allow this for a while  but they relaxed those restrictions in September 2010    On March 8  2011  Techradar reported that Adobe provides an experimental server side tool    to convert Flash programs  as far as possible  to HTML5 code  thus allowing iOS devices to display the content   If the content is Flash video being served by Adobe Flash Media Server 4 5  the server will translate and send the video as HTTP Dynamic Streaming or HTTP Live Streaming  both of which can be played by iOS devices   Some specialized mobile browsers manage to accommodate Flash via streaming content from the cloud directly to a user s device  Some examples are Photon Browser and Puffin Web Browser  The mobile version of Internet Explorer 8 for Windows Phone cannot play Flash content  The IE9 web browser on Microsoft Windows Phone 7 5   Mango   cannot play Flash content either   5 4  Availability on other computing devices  Adobe Flash Lite is a lightweight version of Adobe Flash Player intended for mobile phones and other portable electronic devices like Chumby and iRiver   On the emerging single board enthusiast market  as substantially popularized by the Raspberry Pi  support from Adobe is lacking  However  Gnash have been ported and found useful   5 5  Accessibility  Using Flash tends to break conventions associated with normal HTML pages  Selecting text  scrolling  form control and right clicking act differently from with a regular HTML webpage  Many such interface unexpectancies are fixable by the designer  Usability expert Jakob Nielsen published an Alertbox in 2000 entitled  Flash  99% Bad  which listed issues like these  Some problems have been at least partially fixed since Nielsen s complaints   Text size can be controlled using full page zoom  found in many modern browsers   It has been possible for authors to include alternative text in Flash since Flash Player 6  This accessibility feature is compatible only with certain screen readers and only under Windows   5 6  Performance  Flash Player supports two distinct modes of video playback  and video decoding may not be used for older video content  Such content causes excessive CPU usage compared to comparable content played with other players   Software Rendered Video   Flash Player supports software rendered video since version 6  Such video supports vector animations displayed above the video content  This obligation may  depending on graphic APIs exposed by the operating system  prohibit using a video overlay  like a traditional multimedia player would use  with the consequence that color space conversion and scaling must happen in software   Hardware Accelerated Video   Flash Player supports hardware accelerated video playback since version 10 2  for H 264  F4V  and FLV video formats  Such video is displayed above all Flash content  and takes advantage of video decoders chipsets installed on the user s device  Developers must specifically use the  StageVideo  technology within Flash Player in order for hardware decoding to be enabled  Flash Player internally uses technologies such as DirectX Video Acceleration and OpenGL to do so  In tests done by Ars Technica in 2008 and 2009  Adobe Flash Player performed better on Windows than Mac OS X and Linux with the same hardware  Performance has later improved for the latter two  on Mac OS X with Flash Player 10 1  and on Linux with Flash Player 11   5 7  Flash blocking in web browsers  Flash content is usually embedded using the object or embed HTML element  A web browser that does not fully implement one of these elements displays the replacement text  if supplied by the web page  Often  a plugin is required for the browser to fully implement these elements  though some users cannot or will not install it   Since Flash can be used to produce content  such as advertisements  that some users find obnoxious or take a large amount of bandwidth to download  some web browsers default to not play Flash content before the user clicks on it  e g  Konqueror  K Meleon   Most current browsers have a feature to block plugins  playing one only when the user clicks it  Opera versions since 10 5 feature native Flash blocking  Opera Turbo requires the user to click to play Flash content  and the browser also allows the user to enable this option permanently  Both Chrome and Firefox have an option to enable  click to play plugins   Equivalent  Flash blocker  extensions is also available for many popular browsers  Firefox has Flashblock and NoScript  Internet Explorer has Foxie  which contains a number of features  one of them named Flashblock  WebKit based browsers under Mac OS X  such as Apple s Safari  have ClickToFlash   5 8  Security  Adobe Flash Player 10 3 introduced a Local Settings Manager that can be accessed from the Microsoft Windows Control Panel or the OS X System Preferences panel  This panel superseded the previous Global Online Settings Manager  The Privacy Settings panel allows users to specify whether websites must ask their permission before using the web camera or microphone  This was apparently part of a fix for vulnerabilities that enabled the use of Flash for spying via web camera   Intego s Year In Mac Security report states that in 2011  the Flashback trojan surfaced targeting Mac OS X users  which first masqueraded as a Flash Player installer  Intego later recommended that Adobe users get trusted updates  only directly from the vendor that publishes them    5 9  Implementational vulnerabilities  Implementational vulnerabilities are flaws in the specific player software  rather than inherent to the Flash format or its usage  In particular  this section s listing of flaws in Adobe s Flash player can not be expected to apply to other players  and vice versa   Adobe Flash Player s security record has caused several security experts to recommend against installing the player  or to block Flash content  the US CERT recommends to block Flash using NoScript  and Charlie Miller recommended  not to install Flash  at the computer security conference CanSecWest  As of July 7  2013  Adobe Flash Player has almost 300 CVE entries  of which 234 were leading to arbitrary code execution  Security vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player account for a third of all vulnerabilities reported in Adobe products   Security experts have predicted that with the rise of HTML5  the Flash plugin may become obsolete  The Sophos Security Threat Report 2013 states that  fortunately  the need for browser plugins such as Flash is diminishing   McAfee s report on 2013 Threats Predictions concurs and predicts that threats will shift towards browsers   5 10  Flash cookies  Like the HTTP cookie  a flash cookie  also known as a “Local Shared Object”  can be used to save application data  Flash cookies are not shared across domains  An August 2009 study by the Ashkan Soltani and a team of researchers at UC Berkeley found that 50% of websites using Flash were also employing flash cookies  yet privacy policies rarely disclosed them  and user controls for privacy preferences were lacking  Most browsers  cache and history suppress or delete functions did not affect Flash Player s writing Local Shared Objects to its own cache in version 10 2 and earlier  at which point the user community was much less aware of the existence and function of Flash cookies than HTTP cookies  Thus  users with those versions  having deleted HTTP cookies and purged browser history files and caches  may believe that they have purged all tracking data from their computers when in fact Flash browsing history remains  Adobe s own Flash   a submenu of Adobe s Flash   and other editors and toolkits can manage settings for and delete Flash Local Shared Objects   On Windows systems  LSOs are stored in the directory   %appdata%\Macromedia\Flash Player  Deleting the contents of this directory should remove the LSOs  flash cookies  for the current user   6  Alternatives  6 1  HTML5  HTML5 is often cited as an alternative to Adobe Flash technology usage on web pages  Adobe released a tool that converts Flash to HTML5  and Google also released an experimental tool that does the same   6 2  Tools  Commercial software packages that can create SWF files include Toon Boom  Xara Photo & Graphic Designer  Vectorian Giotto  CelAction2D  Toufee  KoolMoves  Express Animator  Alligator Flash Designer  Amara Web and Anime Studio  These applications provide additional capabilities for creating cartoons  especially with tools more tailored to traditionally trained animators  as well as additional rigging for characters  which can speed up character animation considerably  Additionally  there are programs available which translate 3D information into 2D vectors for display in Flash Player   Several third party tools are able to use and generate SWF files  and some tools such as IrfanView are capable of rendering SWF files  through the use of Flash Player  Flash Player cannot ship as part of a pure open source  or completely free operating system  as its distribution is bound to the and subject to proposition first from Adobe  There is no complete free and open source software replacement which offers all the functionality of the latest version of Adobe Flash Player  and although commercial alternatives such as Scaleform GFx do exist  they cannot work within web browsers   Open source Flash content creation software includes Ajax Animator  Clash  OpenOffice Impress  KToon  Salasaga  and Synfig   6 3  Compilers  Apache Flex is an open source software development kit  SDK  for the development of Flash based rich internet applications  The Apache Flex ActionScript 3 0 compiler generates SWF files from ActionScript 3 files  Flex was the primary ActionScript 3 compiler and was actively developed by Adobe before it was donated to Apache Software Foundation in 2011   Haxe is an open source programming language and compiler  that is able to generate SWF files from Haxe programs  As of 2012  Haxe can build programs for Flash Player that perform faster than the same application built with the Adobe Flex SDK compiler  due to additional compiler optimizations supported in Haxe   swfc is an open source ActionScript 3 0 compiler which generates SWF files from script files  which includes SVG tags  It is currently the most complete alternative for building Flash content in Linux  despite being entirely script based and not having a GUI   The Ming library is able to import and export graphics from XML into SWF  Ming has bindings for popular scripting languages such as PHP and Python   6 4  Flash 4 Linux  The Flash 4 Linux project was an initiative to develop an open source Linux application as an alternative to Adobe Flash Professional  Development plans included authoring capacity for 2D animation  and tweening  as well as outputing SWF file formats  F4L evolved into an editor that was capable of authoring 2D animation and publishing of SWF files  Flash 4 Linux was renamed UIRA  UIRA intended to combine the resources and knowledge of the F4L project and the Qflash project  both of which were Open Source applications that aimed to provide an alternative to the proprietary Adobe Flash   UIRA was free software  but was never truly completed  It reached a stage of being no more than a shell of a UI with limited functionality  Due in part to the adoption of the DADVSI law in France  the UIRA project was shut down in January 2008  according to the project s page in SourceForge   7  Open Screen Project  On May 1  2008  Adobe announced the Open Screen Project  with the intent of providing a consistent application interface across devices such as personal computers  mobile devices  and consumer electronics  When the project was announced  seven goals were outlined  the abolition of licensing fees for Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Integrated Runtime  the removal of restrictions on the use of the Shockwave Flash  SWF  and Flash Video  FLV  file formats  the publishing of application programming interfaces for porting Flash to new devices  and the publishing of The Flash Cast protocol and Action Message Format  AMF   which let Flash applications receive information from remote databases     the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of SWF and FLV F4V specs have been published  The Flash Cast protocol—now known as the Mobile Content Delivery Protocol—and AMF protocols have also been made available  with AMF available as an open source implementation  BlazeDS  Work on the device porting layers is in the early stages  Adobe intends to remove the licensing fees for Flash Player and Adobe Integrated Runtime  AIR  for devices at their release for the Open Screen Project   The list of mobile device providers who have joined the project includes Palm  Motorola  and Nokia  who  together with Adobe  have announced a $10 million Open Screen Project fund     the Open Screen Project is no longer accepting new applications according to partner BSQuare  However paid licensing is still an option for device makers who want to use Adobe software   8  See also  Creative Cloud criticism  List of 2D animation software  Saffron Type System
