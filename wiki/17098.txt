  is a modern Japanese martial art  which descended from swordsmanship  kenjutsu  and uses bamboo swords  shinai  and protective armour  bōgu   Today  it is widely practiced within Japan and many other nations across the world   Kendo is a physically and mentally challenging activity that combines martial arts practices and values with sport like strenuous physical activity   1  History  Swordsmen in Japan established schools of kenjutsu  the ancestor of kendo  which continued for centuries and which form the basis of kendo practice today  The formal kendo exercises known as kata were developed several centuries ago as kenjutsu practice for warriors  They are still studied today  in a modified form   The introduction of bamboo practice swords  shinai  and armour  bōgu  to sword training is attributed to Naganuma Shirōzaemon Kunisato during the Shotoku Era  1711–1715   Naganuma developed the use of bōgu and established a training method using the shinai   In addition  the inscription on the gravestone of third son   the 8th headmaster of the Kashima Shinden Jikishinkage ryū Kenjutsu  states that his exploits included improving the bokuto and shinai  and refining the armour by adding a metal grille to the men  head piece  and thick cotton protective coverings to the kote  gauntlets   Kunisato inherited the tradition from his father Heizaemon in 1708  and the two of them worked hard together to improve the bogu until Heizaemon s death   Chiba Shusaku Narimasa  founder of the Hokushin Ittō ryū Hyōhō  北辰一刀流兵法  introduced Gekiken  撃剣   full contact duels with shinai and bogu  to the curriculum of this koryū in the 1820s  Due to the popularity and the large number of students of the Hokushin Ittō ryū Hyōhō at the end of the Edo period  this kind of practice contributed greatly to the spread of shinai and bōgu all over Japan  Also there are many waza like Suriage Men  Oikomi Men etc  in modern Kendo which were originally Hokushin Ittō ryū techniques  named by Chiba Shusaku Narimasa for his school  After the Meiji Restoration in the late 1800s Sakakibara Kenkichi popularised public gekiken for commercial gain  but also generated an increased interest in kendo and kenjutsu as a result   The Dai Nippon Butoku Kai  DNBK  was established in 1895 to promote the ideals of  bushido  and preserve traditional systems of  bujutsu   The DNBK changed the name of the sporting form of swordsmanship  called gekiken   Kyūjitai  擊劍  Shinjitai  撃剣   hitting sword   to kendō in 1920   Kendo  along with other martial arts  was banned in Japan in 1946 by the occupying powers  This was part of  the removal and exclusion from public life of militaristic and ultra nationalistic persons  in response to the wartime militarisation of martial arts instruction in Japan  The DNBK was also disbanded  Kendo was allowed to return to the curriculum in 1950  first as and then as kendo from 1952    The All Japan Kendo Federation  AJKF or ZNKR  was founded in 1952  immediately after Japan s independence was restored and the ban on martial arts in Japan was lifted  It was formed on the principle of kendo not as a martial art but as educational sport  and it has continued to be practiced as such to this day   The International Martial Arts Federation  IMAF   established in Kyoto 1952  was the first international organisation after WWII to promote the development of martial arts worldwide  Today  IMAF includes kendo as one of the Japanese disciplines   The International Kendo Federation  FIK  was founded in April 1970  it is an international federation of national and regional kendo federations and the world governing body for kendo  The FIK is a non governmental organisation  and its aim is to promote and popularise kendo  iaido and jodo   2  Practitioners  Practitioners of kendo are called   meaning  someone who practices kendo   or occasionally   meaning  swordsman   The old term of kendoists is sometimes used   The  Kodansha Meibo   a register of dan graded members of the All Japan Kendo Federation  shows that as of September 2007  there were 1 48 million registered dan graded kendōka in Japan  According to the survey conducted by the All Japan Kendo Federation  the number of active kendo practitioners in Japan is 477 000 in which 290 000 dan holders are included  From these figures  the All Japan Kendo Federation estimates that the number of  kendōka  in Japan is 1 66 million  with over 6 million practitioners worldwide  by adding the number of the registered dan holders and the active kendo practitioners without dan grade   3  Concept and purpose  In 1975  the All Japan Kendo Federation  AJKF  developed then published  The Concept and Purpose of Kendo  which is reproduced below   3 1  Concept  Kendo is a way to discipline the human character through the application of the principles of the katana   3 2  Purpose   The Concept of Kendo was established by All Japan Kendo Federation in 1975    4  Equipment and clothing  Kendo is practiced wearing a traditional Japanese style of clothing  and using one or  less commonly  two    File Shinai jpg  File Due bokken jpg  File Men  kendo

made up of four bamboo slats  which are held together by leather fittings  A modern variation of a shinai with carbon fiber reinforced resin slats is also used   Kendōka also use hard to practice kata   Kendo employs strikes involving both one edge and the tip of the shinai or bokutō   Protective armour is worn to protect specified target areas on the head  arms and body  The head is protected by a stylised helmet  called   with a to protect the face  a series of hard leather and to protect the throat  and padded to protect the side of the neck and shoulders  The forearms  wrists  and hands are protected by long  thickly padded fabric gloves called   The torso is protected by a   while the waist and groin area is protected by the   consisting of three thick vertical fabric flaps or faulds   4 2  Clothing  The clothing worn under the bōgu comprise a jacket  kendogi or keikogi  and hakama  a garment separated in the middle to form two wide trouser legs   A is wrapped around the head  under the men  to absorb perspiration and provide a base for the men to fit comfortably   5  Modern practice  Kendo training is quite noisy in comparison to some other martial arts or sports  This is because kendōka use a shout  or   to express their fighting spirit when striking  Additionally  kendōka execute   an action similar to a stomp of the front foot  when making a strike   Like some other martial arts  kendōka train and fight barefoot  Kendo is ideally practiced in a purpose built dōjō  though standard sports halls and other venues are often used  An appropriate venue has a clean and well sprung wooden floor  suitable for fumikomi ashi   Modern kendo techniques comprise both strikes and thrusts  Strikes are only made towards specified on the wrists  head  or body  all of which are protected by armour  The targets are men  sayu men  sometimes called sayuno men  or yoko men  upper left or right side of the men   the right kote at any time  the left kote when it is in a raised position  and the left or right side of the dō  are only allowed to the throat  However  since an incorrectly performed thrust could cause serious injury to the opponent s neck  thrusting techniques in free practice and competition are often restricted to senior dan graded kendōka   File Wikikendo3 JPG Kendōka perform sonkyo after combat  File Kendo EM 2005   taiatari jpg Two kendōka in tsuba

waza  to initiate a strike  and ōji waza  a response to an attempted strike   Kendoka who wish to use such techniques during practice or competitions  often practice each technique with a motodachi  This is a process that requires patience  First practising slowly and then as familiarity and confidence builds  the kendoka and motodachi increase the speed to match and competition level   6 1  Shikake waza  These attack techniques are used to create suki in an opponent by initiating an attack  or strike boldly when your opponent has created a suki  Such techniques include     This is a technique used when one s opponent has weak kisei  spirit  vigour  or when they yield a suki under pressure  Always hold kisei and strike quickly     Body and shinai will lose balance as you strike or when being attacked  This technique takes advantage of this to help execute a strike  A good example is Hikibana kote  when a strike is made to an opponent s kote as they feel threatened and raise their kensen as you push forward     This provides a surprise attack  by lifting the shinai over your shoulder before striking  Here a skilful use of the kensen and spirited attack is crucial for effective katsugi waza or luring your opponent into breaking his her posture     There are two types  The first is for moving to the next waza after a failed first strike  and the second holds your opponent s attention and posture to create the suki for a second strike  The former requires a continuous rhythm of correct strikes  The latter requires continuous execution of waza  to take advantage of your opponent s suki     This can be used if one s opponent s kamae has no suki when your opponent tries to attack  Your opponent s shinai is either knocked down from above or swept up from below with a resulting strike just when his her kamae is broken     This technique involves striking your opponent as you realise he she is about to strike  This is because their concentration will be on striking and their posture will have no flexibility to respond  Thus debana waza is ideal  This can be to any part of your opponent s body  with valid strikes being  debana men  debana kote  and debana tsuki   6 2  Oji waza  These counter attack techniques are performed by executing a strike after responding or avoiding an attempted strike by your opponent  This can also be achieved by inducing the opponent to attack  then employing one of the oji waza     Avoiding an attack from another  then instantly responding  Here  timing has to be correct  A response that is too slow or fast may not be effective  Therefore close attention to an opponent s every move is required     If struck by an opponent s shinai  this technique sweeps up their shinai in a rising slide motion  with the right  ura  or left  omote  side of the shinai  Then strike in the direction of their shinai  or at the suki resulting from their composure s collapse  This technique needs to be smooth  That is  don t separate the rising slide motion and the upward sweeping motion or it will not be successful  Valid strikes include  men suriage men  kote suriage men  kote suriage kote  and tsuki suriage men     This waza knocks an opponent s shinai to the right or left  This neutralises a potential strike and gives the ideal chance to strike as an opponent is off balance  For success  an opponent s maai has to be correctly perceived and then one knocks down their shinai before their arm fully extends  Valid examples are  do uchiotoshi men and tsuki uchiotoshi men    This technique is a response  As an opponent strikes  you parry their shinai with yours  Then flip over  turn over your hands  and strike their opposite side  Valid strikes include men kaeshi men  men kaeshi kote  men kaeshi do  kote kaeshi men  kote kaeshi kote  and do kaeshi men   7  Rules of Competition  A scorable in a kendo competition  tai kai  is defined as an accurate strike or thrust made onto a datotsu bui of the opponent s kendo gu with the shinai making contact at its datotsu bu  the competitor displaying high spirits  correct posture and followed by zanshin   Datotsu bui or point scoring targets in kendo are defined as   Men bu  the top or sides of the head protector  sho men and sayu men    Kote bu  a padded area of the right or left wrist protector  migi kote and hidari kote    Do bu  an area of the right or left side of the armour that protects the torso  migi do and hidari do    Tsuki bu  an area of the head protector in front of the throat  tsuki dare   Datotsu bu of the  shinai  is the forward  or blade side  jin bu  of the top third  monouchi  of the shinai     or continuation of awareness  must be present and shown throughout the execution of the strike  and the kendōka must be mentally and physically ready to attack again   In competition  there are usually three   Each referee holds a red flag and a white flag in opposing hands  To award a point  a referee raises the flag corresponding to the colour of the ribbon worn by the scoring competitor  Usually at least two referees must agree for a point to be awarded  The match continues until a pronouncement of the point that has been scored   Kendo competitions are usually a three point match  The first competitor to score two points  therefore wins the match  If the time limit is reached and only one competitor has a point  that competitor wins   In the case of a tie  there are several options     The match is declared a draw     The match is continued until either competitor scores a point     The victor is decided by the referees  The three referees vote for victor by each raising one of their respective flags simultaneously   8  International Kendo Competition  The World Kendo Championships have been held every three years since 1970  They are organised by the International Kendo Federation  FIK  with the support of the host nation s kendo federation  The European championship is held every year  except in those years in which there is a world championship  Kendo is also one of the martial arts in the World Combat Games   9  Advancement  9 1  Grades  Technical achievement in kendo is measured by advancement in grade  rank or level  The and grading system  created in 1883  is used to indicate one s proficiency in kendo  The dan levels are from to   There are usually six grades below first dan  known as kyu  The kyu numbering is in reverse order  with being the grade immediately below first dan  and being the lowest grade  There are no visible differences in dress between kendo grades  those below dan level may dress the same as those above dan level   is the highest dan grade attainable through a test of physical kendo skills  In the AJKF the grades of and tenth dan are no longer awarded  but ninth dan kendōka are still active in Japanese kendo  International Kendo Federation  FIK  grading rules allow national kendo organisations to establish a special committee to consider the award of those grades   All candidates for examination face a panel of examiners  A larger  more qualified panel is usually assembled to assess the higher dan grades  Kendo examinations typically consist of jitsugi  a demonstration of the skill of the applicants  Nihon Kendo Kata and a written exam  The eighth dan kendo exam is extremely difficult  with a reported pass rate of less than 1 percent   9 2  Titles  can be earned in addition to the above dan grades by kendōka of a defined dan grade  These are     and   The title is affixed to the front of the dan grade when said  for example   The qualifications for each title are below   10  Kata  Kata are fixed patterns that teach kendoka the basic elements of swordsmanship  The kata include fundamental techniques of attacking and counter attacking  and have useful practical application in general kendo  There are ten   These are generally practised with   Occasionally  real swords or swords with a blunt edge  called or   may be used for display of kata   All are performed by two people  the   the teacher  and   the student  The uchidachi makes the first move or attack in each kata  As this is a teaching role  the uchidachi is always the losing side  thus allowing the shidachi to learn and to gain confidence   Kata one to seven are performed with both partners using a normal length wooden sword  Kata eight to ten are performed with uchidachi using a normal length weapon and shidachi using a shorter one  kodachi    The forms of the were finalised in 1933 based on the Dai nihon Teikoku Kendo Kata  composed in 1912   It is impossible to link the individual forms of Dai nihon Teikoku Kendo Kata to their original influences  although the genealogical reference diagram does indicate the masters of the various committees involved  and it is possible from this to determine the influences and origins of Kendo and the Kata    In 2003  the All Japan Kendo Federation introduced   a set of basic exercises using a bokuto  This form of practice  is intended primarily for kendōka up to   but is very useful for all kendo students which are organised under FIK   Kata can also be treated as competitions where players are judged upon their performance and technique   11  National and international organisations  Many national and regional organisations manage and promote kendo activities outside Japan  The major organising body is the International Kendo Federation  FIK   The FIK is a non governmental international federation of national and regional kendo organisations  An aim of the FIK is to provide a link between Japan and the international kendo community and to promote and popularise kendo  iaido and jodo  The FIK was established in 1970 with 17 national federations  The number of affiliated and recognised organisations has increased over the years to 53  as of February 2012   The FIK is recognised by SportAccord as a  Full Member   and by the World Anti Doping Agency   Other organisations that promote the study of Japanese martial arts  including kendo  are the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai  DNBK  and the International Martial Arts Federation  IMAF   The current DNBK has no connection to the pre war organisation  although it shares the same goals  The International Martial Arts Federation  IMAF  was established in Kyoto in 1952 and is dedicated to the promotion and development of the martial arts worldwide  including kendo   12  See also  Gendai budō modern Japanese martial arts  Iaidō Sword drawing  Jōdō A martial art using a short wooden staff  or stick
