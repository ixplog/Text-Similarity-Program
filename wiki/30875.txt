Theocracy is a form of government in which clergy have official recognition as the civil ruler and official policy is either governed by officials regarded as divinely guided  or is pursuant to the doctrine of a particular religion or religious group   1  Synopsis  From the perspective of the theocratic government   God himself is recognized as the head  of the state  hence the term theocracy  from the Koine Greek  rule of God   a term used by Josephus for the kingdoms of Israel and Judah   Taken literally or strictly  theocracy means rule by God or gods and refers primarily to an internal  rule of the heart   especially in its biblical application  The common  generic use of the term  as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership  would be more accurately described as an ecclesiocracy   In a pure theocracy  the civil leader is believed to have a personal connection with the civilization s religion or belief  For example  Moses led the Israelites  and Muhammad ruled the early Muslims  Law proclaimed by the ruler is also considered a divine revelation  and hence the law of God  An ecclesiocracy  on the other hand  is a situation where the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state  but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation  For example  the prince bishops of the European Middle Ages  where the bishop was also the temporal ruler  Such a state may use the administrative hierarchy of the religion for its own administration  or it may have two  arms  — administrators and clergy — but with the state administrative hierarchy subordinate to the religious hierarchy  The papacy in the Papal States occupied a middle ground between theocracy and ecclesiocracy  since the pope did not claim he was a prophet who received revelation from God and translated it into civil law   Religiously endorsed monarchies fall between these two poles  according to the relative strengths of the religious and political organs   Theocracy is distinguished from other  secular forms of government that have a state religion  or are influenced by theological or moral concepts  and monarchies held  By the Grace of God   In the most common usage of the term  some civil rulers are leaders of the dominant religion  e g   the Byzantine emperor as patron and defender of the official Church   the government proclaims it rules on behalf of God or a higher power  as specified by the local religion  and divine approval of government institutions and laws  These characteristics apply also to a caesaropapist regime  The Byzantine Empire however was not theocratic since the patriarch answered to the emperor  not vice versa  similarly in Tudor England the crown forced the church to break away from Rome so the royal  and  especially later  parliamentary  power could assume full control of the now Anglican hierarchy and confiscate most church property and income   Secular governments can also co exist with a state religion or delegate some aspects of civil law to religious communities  For example  in Israel marriage is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents  yet no form of civil marriage  free of religion  for atheists  for example  exists nor marriage by non recognized minority religions  India similarly delegates control of marriage and some other civil matters to the religious communities  in large part as a way of accommodating its Muslim minority   2  Etymology  The word theocracy originates from the Greek θεοκρατία meaning  the rule of God   This in turn derives from θεός  theos   meaning  god   and κρατέω  krateo   meaning  to rule   Thus the meaning of the word in Greek was  rule by god s   or human incarnation s  of god s    It was first coined by Josephus Flavius in the first century A D  to describe the characteristic government for Jews  Josephus argued that while the Greeks recognized three types of government  monarchy  aristocracy  and anarchy  the Jews were unique in that they had a system of government that did not fit into those categories  Josephus understood theocracy as a fourth form of government in which only God and his law is sovereign  Josephus  definition was widely accepted until the Enlightenment era  when the term started to collect more universalistic and negative connotations  especially in Hegel s hands  The first recorded English use was in 1622  with the meaning  sacerdotal government under divine inspiration   as in Biblical Israel before the rise of kings   the meaning  priestly or religious body wielding political and civil power  is recorded from 1825   3  Current theocracies  3 1  Christian theocracies  3 1 1  Holy See  Vatican City   Following the unification of Italy  Vatican City became the last surviving territory of the former Papal States  In 1929  the State of Vatican City was formally recognized as an independent state through treaties with the Italian government  The head of state of the Vatican is the pope  elected by the College of Cardinals  an assembly of Senatorial princes of the Church  who are usually clerics  appointed as Ordinaries  but in the past have also included men who were not bishops nor clerics  A pope is elected for life  They may resign   Voting is limited to cardinals under 80 years of age  A Secretary for Relations with States  directly responsible for international relations  is appointed by the pope  The Vatican legal system is rooted in canon law but ultimately is decided by the pope  the Bishop of Rome as the Supreme Pontiff   has the fullness of legislative  executive and judicial powers   Although the laws of Vatican City come from the secular laws of Italy  under article 3 of the Law of the Sources of the Law  provision is made for the supplementary application of the “laws promulgated by the Kingdom of Italy ” The government of the Vatican can also be considered an ecclesiocracy  ruled by the Church    3 2  Islamic states or Islamic theocracies  An Islamic state is a state that has adopted Islam  specifically Sharia  as its foundations for political institutions  or laws  exclusively  and has implemented the Islamic ruling system khilafah  Arabic  خلافة   and is therefore a theocracy  Although there is much debate as to which states or groups operate strictly according to Islamic Law  Sharia is the official basis for state laws in the following countries  Afghanistan  Iran  Mauritania  Saudi Arabia  Somalia  Sudan  and Yemen  In Nigeria  the constitution provides that states may elect to use Shari a laws and courts  though non Muslims are not required in any state to submit to Shari a jurisdiction and adherence varies by state   Saudi Arabia maintains religious courts for all aspects of law and has religious police to maintain social compliance   Pakistan has Islam as its only official religion and its Federal Shariat Court has the duty of striking down any law not complying with the Sharia code of Islamic law  however  ruling falls upon legal scholars who  while required to be Muslim  are not religious clerics   3 2 1  Iran  The Islamic Republic of Iran has been described as a  theocratic republic   by the US Central Intelligence Agency   and its constitution a  hybrid  of  theocratic and democratic elements   by Francis Fukuyama   Like other Islamic states it maintains religious laws and has religious courts to interpret all aspects of law  According to Iran s constitution   all civil  penal financial  economic  administrative  cultural  military  political  and other laws and regulations must be based on Islamic criteria    In addition  Iran has a religious ruler and many religious officials in powerful government posts  The head of state  or  Supreme Leader   is a faqih  scholar of Islamic law   and possesses more power than Iran s president  The Leader appoints the heads of many powerful posts  the commanders of the armed forces  the director of the national radio and television network  the heads of the powerful major religious foundations  the chief judge  the chief prosecutor  special tribunals  and members of national security councils dealing with defence and foreign affairs  He also co appoints the 12 jurists of the Guardian Council    The Leader is elected by the Assembly of Experts which is made up of mujtahids  Islamic scholars competent in interpreting shariah law    Another body  the Council of Guardians  has the power to veto bills from majlis  parliament   approve or disapprove candidates who wish to run for high office  president  majlis  the Assembly of Experts   The council supervises elections  and can greenlight or ban investigations into the election process  Six of the Guardians  half the council  are faqih empowered to approve or veto all bills from the majlis  parliament  according to whether the faqih believe them to be in accordance with Islamic law and customs  the Sharia   The other six members are lawyers appointed by the head of the judiciary  who is also a cleric and also appointed by the Leader   3 3  Central Tibetan Administration  The Central Tibetan Administration  colloquially known as the Tibetan government in exile  is a Tibetan exile organisation with a state like internal structure  According to its charter  the position of head of state of the Central Tibetan Administration belongs ex officio to the current Dalai Lama  a religious hierarch  In this respect  it continues the traditions of the former government of Tibet  which was ruled by the Dalai Lamas and their ministers  with a specific role reserved for a class of monk officials   On March 14  2011  at the 14th Dalai Lama s suggestion  the parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration began considering a proposal to remove the Dalai Lama s role as head of state in favor of an elected leader   The first directly elected Kalön Tripa was Samdhong Rinpoche  who was elected August 20  2001   Before 2011  the Kalön Tripa position was subordinate to the 14th Dalai Lama who presided over the government in exile from its founding  In August of that year  Lobsang Sangay polled 55 per cent votes out of 49 189  defeating his nearest rival Tethong Tenzin Namgyal by 8 646 votes  becoming the second popularly elected Kalon Tripa  The Dalai Lama announced that his political authority would be transferred to Sangay   3 3 1  Change to Sikyong  On September 20  2012  the 15th Tibetan Parliament in Exile unanimously voted to change the title of Kalön Tripa to Sikyong in Article 19 of the Charter of the Tibetans in exile and relevant articles  The Dalai Lama had previously referred to the Kalon Tripa as Sikyong  and this usage was cited as the primary justification for the name change  According to Tibetan Review   Sikyong  translates to  political leader   as distinct from  spiritual leader   Foreign affairs Kalon Dicki Chhoyang stated that the term  Sikyong  has had a precedent dating back to the 7th Dalai Lama  and that the name change  ensures historical continuity and legitimacy of the traditional leadership from the fifth Dalai Lama   The online Dharma Dictionary translates sikyong  srid skyong  as  secular ruler  regime  regent   The title sikyong had previously been used by regents who ruled Tibet during the Dalai Lama s minority   3 4  States with official state religion  Having a state religion is not sufficient to be a theocracy in the narrow sense  Many countries have a state religion without the government directly deriving its powers from a divine authority or a religious authority directly exercising governmental powers  Since the narrow sense has few instances in the modern world  the more common usage is the wider sense of an enforced state religion   4  Historic states with theocratic aspects  4 1  Buddhism  Unified religious rule in Tibet began in 1642  when the Fifth Dalai Lama allied with the military power of the Mongol Gushri Khan to consolidate the political power and center control around his office as head of the Gelug school  This form of government is known as the dual system of government  Prior to 1642  particular monasteries and monks had held considerable power throughout Tibet  but had not achieved anything approaching complete control  though power continued to be held in a diffuse  feudal system after the ascension of the Fifth Dalai Lama  Power in Tibet was held by a number of traditional elites  including members of the nobility  the heads of the major Buddhist sects  including their various tulkus   and various large and influential monastic communities   Political power was sometimes used by monastic leaders to suppress rival religious schools through the confiscation of property and direct violence  Social mobility was somewhat possible through the attainment of a monastic education  or recognition as a reincarnated teacher  but such institutions were dominated by the traditional elites and governed by political intrigue  Non Buddhists in Tibet were members of an outcast underclass   The Bogd Khaanate period of Mongolia  1911 1919  is also cited as a former Buddhist theocracy   4 2  China  Similar to the Roman Emperor  the Chinese sovereign was historically held to be the Son of Heaven however from the first historical Emperor on  this was largely ceremonial and tradition quickly established it as a posthumous dignity  like the Roman institution  The situation before Qin Shi Huang Di is less clear   The Shang dynasty essentially functioned as a theocracy  declaring the ruling family the sons of heaven and calling the chief sky god Shangdi after a word for their deceased ancestors  After their overthrow by the Zhou  the royal clan of Shang were not eliminated but instead moved to a ceremonial capital where they were charged to continue the performance of their rituals   The titles combined by Shi Huangdi to form his new title of emperor were originally applied to god like beings who ordered the heavens and earth and to culture heroes credited with the invention of agriculture  clothing  music  astrology  &c  Even after the fall of Qin  an emperor s words were considered sacred edicts    and his written proclamations  directives from above       As a result  some Sinologists translate the title huangdi  usually rendered  emperor   as thearch  The term properly refers to the head of a thearchy  a kingdom of gods   but the more accurate  theocrat  carries associations of a strong priesthood that would be generally inaccurate in describing imperial China  Others reserve the use of  thearch  to describe the legendary figures of Chinese prehistory while continuing to use  emperor  to describe historical rulers   4 3  Christianity  In the Byzantine Empire  324 1453 AD  the Emperor was the head of civil society  He also exercised authority over the ecclesiastical authorities  or patriarchates  The emperor was considered to be God s omnipotent representative on earth and he ruled as an absolute autocrat   Geneva under John Calvin s influence and the Massachusetts Bay Colony of the  Puritans  had many characteristics of Protestant theocracies   The short reign  1494–1498  of Girolamo Savonarola  a Dominican priest  over the city of Florence had features of a theocracy  During his rule   un Christian  books  statues  poetry  and other items were burned  in the Bonfire of the Vanities   sodomy was made a capital offense  and other Christian practices became law   Although having a lay ruler  the King of Jerusalem  the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem  1099 1299  is considered to have some theocratic influences   Also the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector is also considered to have a considerable amount of theocratic influence   The Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace in 1860s Qing China was a heterodox Christian theocracy led by a person who said that he was the younger brother of Jesus Christ  Hong Xiuquan  This theocratic state fought one of the most destructive wars in history  the Taiping Rebellion  against the Qing Dynasty for fifteen years before being crushed following the fall of the rebel capital Nanking   4 4  Islam  Caliphs  from the Arabic word Khalifah which means successor  did not claim to receive revelation directly from Allah  as did Muhammad  Rather  they stated that they based their decrees on the Quran  Hadith  etc    4 5  Montenegro  Prince Bishopric of Montenegro offers a singular example of monarchs willingly turning their power to ecclesiastic authority  Montenegrin Orthodox   as the last of the House of Crnojević  styled Grand Voivode  not sovereign princes  did  in order to preserve national unity before the Ottoman onslaught as a separate millet under an autochthonous ethnarch  When Montenegro re established secular dynastic succession by the proclamation of princedom in 1851  it did so in favor of the last Prince bishop  who changed his style from Vladika i upravitelj Crne Gore i Brde  Vladika  Bishop  and Ruler of Montenegro and Brda  to Po Bozjoj milosti knjaz i gospodar Crne Gore i Brde  By the grace of God Prince and Sovereign of Montenegro and Brda   thus rendering his de facto dynasty  the Petrović Njegoš family since 1696  a hereditary one   4 6  United States  Deseret   Another ecclesiocracy was the administration of the short lived State of Deseret  an independent entity briefly organized in the Western United States by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  Its original borders stretched from western Colorado to the southern California coast  When the Mormons arrived in the valley of the Great Salt Lake in 1847  the Great Basin was still a part of Mexico and had no secular government  As a result  Brigham Young administered the region both spiritually and temporally through the highly organized and centralized Melchizedek Priesthood  This original organization was based upon a concept called theodemocracy  a governmental system combining Biblical theocracy with mid 19th century American political ideals  including heavy reliance upon the U S  Constitution   The treaty of Guadalupe Hildalgo resulted in the Mexican Cession by which Deseret was incorporated into the United States  In 1849  the Saints organized a secular government in Utah  although many ecclesiastical leaders maintained their positions of secular power  The Mormons also petitioned Congress to have Deseret admitted into the Union as a state  However  under the Compromise of 1850  Utah Territory was created and Brigham Young was appointed governor  In this situation  Young still stood as head of the LDS Church as well as Utah s secular government   After the abortive Utah War of 1857–1858  the replacement of Young by an outside Federal Territorial Governor  the eventual resolution of controversies regarding plural marriage  and accession by Utah to statehood  the apparent temporal aspects of LDS theodemocracy receded markedly  However  — like many Christians  Jews  and Muslims — Latter day Saints regard some form of theocracy with God as the head  king  of a chiliastic world government to be the true political ideal  But  until the Second Coming of Christ  the Mormons teach in their 12th Article of Faith  submission to the powers that be  But true to their beliefs in individual liberty and moral accountability  they exhibit a strong preference for democratic republican  representative government as embodied in the Constitution of the United States   4 7  Western Antiquity  The imperial cults in Ancient Egypt and the Roman Empire  as well as numerous other monarchies  deified the ruling monarch  The state religion was often dedicated to the worship of the ruler as a deity  or the incarnation thereof   Early Israel was ruled by Judges before instituting a monarchy  The Judges were believed to be representatives of YHVH Yahweh  in Latin  Jehovah    In ancient and medieval Christianity  Caesaropapism is the doctrine where a head of state is at the same time the head of the church   4 8  Zoroastrianism  During the Achaemenid Empire  Zoroastrianism was the state religion and included formalized worship  The Persian kings were known to be pious Zoroastrians and also ruled with a Zoroastrian form of law called asha  However  Cyrus the Great  who founded the empire  avoided imposing the Zoroastrian faith on the inhabitants of conquered territory  Cyrus s kindness towards Jews has been cited as sparking Zoroastrian influence on Judaism   Under the Seleucids  Zoroastrianism became autonomous  During the Sassanid period  the Zoroastrian calendar was reformed  image use was banned  Fire Temples were increasingly built and intolerance towards other faiths prevailed   5  Fictional theocracies  Depictions of a fictional society dominated by a theocracy recur in science fiction  speculative fiction and fantasy  Such depictions are mostly dystopian  and in some cases humorous or satirical  positively presented theocracies are very much the exception   Some fictional Theocracies are based on a future or alternate history development of actual religions  in others the religions depicted are wholly fictional   The following table is sorted by time of publication  for series  time of earliest publication    5 1
