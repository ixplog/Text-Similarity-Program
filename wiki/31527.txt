In electronics design  tape out or tapeout is the final result of the design cycle for integrated circuits or printed circuit boards  the point at which the artwork for the photomask of a circuit is sent for manufacture   Some sources have indicated that the roots of the term can be traced back to the time when paper tape and later magnetic tape reels were loaded with the final electronic files used to create the photomask at the factory  Other sources reference the early days of printed circuit design  when the enlarged  for higher precision   artwork  for the photomask was manually  taped out  using black line tape and adhesive backed die cut elements on sheets of PET film  Subsequently the artwork was photographically reduced  A similar process was used for early integrated circuits   The term tapeout currently is used to describe the creation of the photomask itself from the final approved electronic CAD file  This stage is sometimes referred to as PG  for Pattern Generation  Designers may use this term to refer to the writing of the final file to disk or CD and its subsequent transmission to the foundry  however  in current practice the foundry will perform checks and make modifications to the mask design specific to the manufacturing process before actual tapeout  Optical proximity correction is an example of such an advanced mask modification  it corrects for the wave like behavior of light when etching the nano scale features of the most modern integrated circuits   A modern IC has to go through a long and complex design process before it is ready for tape out  Many of the steps along the way utilize software tools collectively known as electronic design automation  EDA   The design must then go through a series of verification steps collectively known as  signoff  before it can be taped out  Tape out is usually a cause for celebration by everyone who worked on the project  followed by trepidation awaiting the first article  the first physical samples of a chip from the manufacturing facility  semiconductor foundry    The weeks before the tapeout are categorized as  sleepless nights  in the parlance of IC Designers   First tapeout is rarely the end of work for the design team  Most chips will go through a set of spins in which fixes are implemented after testing the first article  Many different factors can cause a spin  including   The taped out design fails final checks at the foundry due to problems manufacturing the design itself   The design is successfully fabricated  but the first article fails functionality tests   1  References  2  See also  Semiconductor fabrication  GDSII
