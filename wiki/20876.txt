Mimosa is a genus of about 400 species of herbs and shrubs  in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the legume family Fabaceae  The generic name is derived from the Greek word  mimos   meaning  mimic    Two species in the genus are especially notable  One is Mimosa pudica  because of the way it folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat  It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value  both as a houseplant in temperate areas  and outdoors in the tropics  Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas  notably Hawaii  The other is Mimosa tenuiflora  which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark   1  Taxonomy  The taxonomy of the genus Mimosa has had a tortuous history  having gone through periods of splitting and lumping  ultimately accumulating over 3 000 names  many of which have either been synonymized under other species or transferred to other genera  In part due to these changing circumscriptions  the name  Mimosa  has also been applied to several other related species with similar pinnate or bipinnate leaves  but are now classified in other genera  most commonly to Albizia julibrissin  silk tree  and Acacia dealbata  wattle    2  Description  Members of this genus are among the few plants capable of rapid movement  examples outside of Mimosa include the telegraph plant  and the venus flytrap  The leaves of the Mimosa pudica close quickly when touched  Some mimosas raise their leaves in day and lower them at night  and experiments done by Jacques d Ortous de Mairan on mimosas in 1729 provided the first evidence of biological clocks  Mimosa can be distinguished from the large related genera  Acacia and Albizia  since its flowers have 10 or fewer stamens  Note that  botanically  what appears to be a single globular flower is actually a cluster of many individual ones  Mimosa contains some level of heptanoic acid   3  Species  There are about 400 species including   Mimosa aculeaticarpa Ortega  Mimosa aculeaticarpa var  biuncifera Ortega  Mimosa arenosa  Willd   Poir   Mimosa asperata L   Mimosa borealis Gray  Mimosa casta L   Mimosa cupica Gray  Mimosa ceratonia L   Mimosa diplotricha C Wright ex Sauvalle  Mimosa distachya Cav   Mimosa dysocarpa Benth   Mimosa emoryana Benth   Mimosa grahamii Gray  Mimosa hostilis  Mimosa hystricina  Small ex Britt  et Rose  B L Turner  Mimosa latidens  Small  B L  Turner  Mimosa laxiflora Benth   Mimosa malacophylla Gray  Mimosa microphylla Dry   Mimosa nuttallii  DC   B L  Turner  Mimosa pellita Kunth ex Willd   Mimosa pigra L   Mimosa pudica L    La sensitive  Mimosa quadrivalvis L   Mimosa quadrivalvis var  hystricina  Small  Barneby  Mimosa quadrivalvis var  quadrivalvis L   Mimosa roemeriana Scheele  Mimosa rubicaulis Lam   Mimosa rupertiana B L  Turner  Mimosa scabrella Benth   Mimosa schomburgkii Benth   Mimosa somnians  Mimosa strigillosa Torr  et Gray  Mimosa tenuiflora  Willd   Poir     Mimosa hostilis   Mimosa texana  Gray  Small  Mimosa turneri Barneby  Mimosa verrucosa Benth   4  References  Barneby  R C  1992  Sensitivae Censitae  A description of the genus Mimosa Linnaeus  Mimosaceae  in the New World  Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden  vol  65   5  External links
