A kenning  Modern Icelandic pronunciation    derived from Old Norse  is a type of circumlocution  in the form of a compound that employs figurative language in place of a more concrete single word noun  Kennings are strongly associated with Old Norse and later Icelandic and Anglo Saxon poetry   They usually consist of two words  and are often hyphenated  For example  Old Norse poets might replace sverð  the regular word for “sword”  with a more abstract compound such as “wound hoe”  Egill Skallagrímsson  Höfuðlausn 8   or a genitive phrase such as randa íss “ice of shields”  Einarr Skúlason  ‘Øxarflokkr’ 9   Modern scholars have also applied the term kenning to similar figures of speech in other languages  especially Old English   1  Etymology  The word was adopted into English in the nineteenth century from medieval Icelandic treatises on poetics  in particular the Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson  and derives ultimately from the Old Norse verb kenna “know  recognise  perceive  feel  show  teach  etc ”  as used in the expression kenna við “to name after  to express  one thing  in terms of  another ”  “name after  refer to in terms of”  and kenna til “qualify by  make into a kenning by adding”   The corresponding Modern English verb to ken survives only in highly remote English dialects  other than the derivative existing in the standard language in the set expression beyond one’s ken  “beyond the scope of one’s knowledge” and in the phonologically altered form uncanny  “surreal” or “supernatural”  Modern Scots retains  with slight differences between dialects  tae ken  Old Norse kenna  Modern Icelandic kenna  Swedish känna  Danish kende  Norwegian kjenne or kjenna  is cognate with Old English cennan  Old Frisian kenna  kanna  Old Saxon  ant kennian  Middle Dutch and Dutch kennen   Old High German  ir   in   pi   chennan  Middle High German and German kennen   Gothic kannjan   Proto Germanic *kannjanan  originally causative of *kunnanan “to know  how to ”  whence Modern English can  to be able   from the same Proto Indo European root as Modern English know and Latin derived cognition    2  Structure  Old Norse kennings take the form of a genitive phrase  báru fákr  wave’s steed    “ship”  Þorbjörn hornklofi  Glymdrápa 3   or a compound word  gjálfr marr  sea steed    “ship”  Anon   Hervararkviða 27    The simplest kennings consist of a base word  Modern Icelandic stofnorð  German Grundwort  and a determinant  Modern Icelandic kenniorð  German Bestimmung  which qualifies  or modifies  the meaning of the base word  The determinant may be a noun used uninflected as the first element in a compound word  with the base word constituting the second element of the compound word  Alternatively the determinant may be a noun in the genitive case  placed before or after the base word  either directly or separated from the base word by intervening words   Thus the base words in these examples are fákr and marr “steed”  the determinants báru “wave’s” and gjálfr “sea”  The unstated noun the kenning refers to is called its referent  in this case  skip “ship”   In Old Norse poetry  either component of a kenning  base word  determinant or both  could consist of an ordinary noun or a heiti “poetic synonym”  In the above examples  fákr and marr are distinctively poetic lexemes  the normal word for “horse” in Old Norse prose is hestr   3  Complex kennings  The skalds also employed complex kennings in which the determinant  or sometimes the base word  is itself made up of a further kenning  grennir gunn más “feeder of war gull”   “feeder of raven”   “warrior”  Þorbjörn hornklofi  Glymdrápa 6   eyðendr arnar hungrs “destroyers of eagle’s hunger”   “feeders of eagle”   “warrior”  Þorbjörn Þakkaskáld  Erlingsdrápa 1   referring to carnivorous birds scavenging after a battle   Where one kenning is embedded in another like this  the whole figure is said to be tvíkent “doubly determined  twice modified”   Frequently  where the determinant is itself a kenning  the base word of the kenning that makes up the determinant is attached uninflected to the front of the base word of the whole kenning to form a compound word  mög fellandi mellu “son slayer of giantess”   “slayer of sons of giantess”   “slayer of giants”   “the god Thor”  Steinunn Refsdóttir  Lausavísa 2    If the figure comprises more than three elements  it is said to be rekit “extended”  Kennings of up to seven elements are recorded in skaldic verse  Snorri himself characterises five element kennings as an acceptable license but cautions against more extreme constructions  Níunda er þat at reka til hinnar fimtu kenningar  er ór ættum er ef lengra er rekit  en þótt þat finnisk í fornskálda verka  þá látum vér þat nú ónýtt  “The ninth  license  is extending a kenning to the fifth determinant  but it is out of proportion if it is extended further  Even if it can be found in the works of ancient poets  we no longer tolerate it ” The longest kenning found in skaldic poetry occurs in Hafgerðingadrápa by Þórður Sjáreksson and reads nausta blakks hlé mána gífrs drífu gim slöngvir “fire brandisher of blizzard of ogress of protection moon of steed of boat shed”  which simply means  warrior    4  Word order and comprehension  Word order in Old Norse was generally freer than in Modern English  This freedom is exploited to the full in skaldic verse and taken to extremes far beyond what would be natural in prose  Other words can intervene between a base word and its genitive determinant  and occasionally between the elements of a compound word  tmesis   Kennings  and even whole clauses  can be interwoven  Ambiguity is usually less than it would be if an English text were subjected to the same contortions  thanks to the more elaborate morphology of Old Norse   Another factor aiding comprehension is that Old Norse kennings tend to be highly conventional  Most refer to the same small set of topics  and do so using a relatively small set of traditional metaphors  Thus a leader or important man will be characterised as generous  according to one common convention  and called an  enemy of gold    attacker of treasure    destroyer of arm rings   etc  and a friend of his people  Nevertheless there are many instances of ambiguity in the corpus  some of which may be intentional  and some evidence that  rather than merely accepting it from expediency  skalds favoured contorted word order for its own sake   5  Definitions  Some scholars take the term kenning broadly to include any noun substitute consisting of two or more elements  including merely descriptive epithets  such as Old Norse grand viðar “bane of wood”   “fire”  Snorri Sturluson  Skáldskaparmál 36    while others would restrict it to metaphorical instances  such as Old Norse sól húsanna “sun of the houses”   “fire”  Snorri Sturluson  Skáldskaparmál 36    specifically those where “ t he base word identifies the referent with something which it is not  except in a specially conceived relation which the poet imagines between it and the sense of the limiting element ”  Brodeur  1959  pp  248–253   Some even exclude naturalistic metaphors such as Old English forstes bend “bond of frost”   “ice” or winter ġewǣde “winter raiment”   “snow”  “A metaphor is a kenning only if it contains an incongruity between the referent and the meaning of the base word  in the kenning the limiting word is essential to the figure because without it the incongruity would make any identification impossible”  Brodeur  1959  pp  248–253   Descriptive epithets are a common literary device in many parts of the world  whereas kennings in this restricted sense are a distinctive feature of Old Norse and  to a lesser extent  Old English poetry   Snorri’s own usage  however  seems to fit the looser sense  “Snorri uses the term  kenning  to refer to a structural device  whereby a person or object is indicated by a periphrastic description containing two or more terms  which can be a noun with one or more dependent genitives or a compound noun or a combination of these two structures ”  Faulkes  1998 a   p  xxxiv   The term is certainly applied to non metaphorical phrases in Skáldskaparmál  En sú kenning er áðr var ritat  at kalla Krist konung manna  þá kenning má eiga hverr konungr  “And that kenning which was written before  calling Christ the king of men  any king can have that kenning  Likewise in Háttatal  Þat er kenning at kalla fleinbrak orrostu       “It is a kenning to call battle ‘spear crash’      ”   Snorri’s expression kend heiti  qualified terms  appears to be synonymous with kenningar  although Brodeur applies this more specifically to those periphrastic epithets which don’t come under his strict definition of kenning   Sverdlov approaches the question from a morphological standpoint  Noting that the modifying component in Germanic compound words can take the form of a genitive or a bare root  he points to behavioural similarities between genitive determinants and the modifying element in regular Old Norse compound words  such as the fact that neither can be modified by a free standing  declined  adjective  According to this view  all kennings are formally compounds  notwithstanding widespread tmesis   6  Semantics  Kennings could be developed into extended  and sometimes vivid  metaphors  tröddusk törgur fyr       hjalta harðfótum “shields were trodden under the hard feet of the hilt  sword blades ”  Eyvindr Skáldaspillir  Hákonarmál 6   svarraði sárgymir á sverða nesi “wound sea   blood  sprayed on headland of swords   shield ”  Eyvindr Skáldaspillir  Hákonarmál 7   Snorri calls such examples nýgervingar and exemplifies them in verse 6 of his Háttatal  The effect here seems to depend on an interplay of more or less naturalistic imagery and jarring artifice  But the skalds weren’t averse either to arbitrary  purely decorative  use of kennings  “That is  a ruler will be a distributor of gold even when he is fighting a battle and gold will be called the fire of the sea even when it is in the form of a man’s arm ring on his arm  If the man wearing a gold ring is fighting a battle on land the mention of the sea will have no relevance to his situation at all and does not contribute to the picture of the battle being described”  Faulkes  1997   pp  8–9    Snorri draws the line at mixed metaphor  which he terms nykrat “made monstrous”  Snorri Sturluson  Háttatal 6   and his nephew called the practice löstr “a fault”  Óláfr hvítaskáld  Third Grammatical Treatise 80   In spite of this  it seems that “many poets did not object to and some must have preferred baroque juxtapositions of unlike kennings and neutral or incongruous verbs in their verses”  Foote & Wilson  1970   p  332   E g  heyr jarl Kvasis dreyra “listen  earl  to Kvasir’s blood   poetry ”  Einarr skálaglamm  Vellekla 1    Sometimes there is a kind of redundancy whereby the referent of the whole kenning  or a kenning for it  is embedded  barmi dólg svölu “brother of hostility swallow”   “brother of raven”   “raven”  Oddr breiðfirðingr  Illugadrápa 1   blik meiðendr bauga láðs “gleam harmers of the land of rings”   “harmers of gleam of arm”   “harmers of ring”   “leaders  nobles  men of social standing  conceived of as generously destroying gold  i e  giving it away freely ”  Anon   Líknarbraut 42    While some Old Norse kennings are relatively transparent  many depend on a knowledge of specific myths or legends  Thus the sky might be called naturalistically él ker “squall vat”  Markús Skeggjason  Eiríksdrápa 3  or described in mythical terms as Ymis haus “Ymir’s skull”  Arnórr jarlaskáld  Magnúsdrápa 19   referring to the idea that the sky was made out of the skull of the primeval giant Ymir  Still others name mythical entities according to certain conventions without reference to a specific story  rimmu Yggr “Odin of battle”   “warrior”  Arnórr jarlaskáld  Magnúsdrápa 5    Poets in medieval Iceland even treated Christian themes using the traditional repertoire of kennings complete with allusions to heathen myths and aristocratic epithets for saints  Þrúðr falda “goddess of headdresses”   “Saint Catherine”  Kálfr Hallsson  Kátrínardrápa 4    Kennings of the type AB  where B routinely has the characteristic A and thus this AB is tautological  tend to mean  like B in that it has the characteristic A   e g   shield Njörðr   tautological because the god Njörðr by nature has his own shield  means  like Njörðr in that he has a shield   i e   warrior   A modern English example is  painted Jezebel  as a disapproving expression for a woman too fond of using cosmetics   Sometimes a name given to one well known member of a species  is used to mean any member of that species  For example  Old Norse valr means  falcon   but Old Norse mythology mentions a horse named Valr  and thus in Old Norse poetry valr is sometimes used to mean  horse   A modern example of this is an ad hoc usage by a helicopter ambulance pilot   the Heathrow of hang gliders  for the hills behind Hawes on Yorkshire in England  when he found the air over the emergency site crowded with hang gliders   7  Ellipsis  A term may be omitted from a well known kenning  val teigs Hildr “hawk ground’s valkyrie goddess”  Haraldr Harðráði  Lausavísa 19   The full expression implied here is “goddess of gleam fire adornment of ground land seat perch of hawk”   “goddess of gleam of arm”   “goddess of gold”   “lady”  characterised according to convention as wearing golden jewellery  the arm kenning being a reference to falconry   The poet relies on listeners’ familiarity with such conventions to carry the meaning   8  Old Norse kennings in context  In the following dróttkvætt stanza  the Norwegian skald Eyvind Finnson skáldaspillir  d  ca 990  compares the greed of king Harald Gråfell to the generosity of his predecessor Haakon the Good    Eyvindr skáldaspillir  Lausavísa 8     Ullr of war leek  We carried the seed of Fýrisvellir on the mountains of hawks during all of Hakon s life  now the enemy of the people has hidden the flour of Fróði s hapless slaves in the flesh of the mother of the enemy of the giantess    This might be paraphrased   O warrior  we carried gold on our arms during all of Hakon s life  now the enemy of the people has hidden gold in the earth    ímun laukr  war leek     sword    Ullr is the name of a god  Ullr  Ullr       ímunlauks  god of sword     warrior   perhaps addressing King Harald  This kenning follows a convention whereby the name of any god is combined with some male attribute  e g  war or weaponry  to produce a kenning for  man    HAUKA FJÖLL  mountains of hawks  are  arms   a reference to the sport of falconry  This follows a convention in which arms are called the land  or any sort of surface  of the hawk   Fýrisvalla fræ  seed of Fýrisvellir     gold   This is an allusion to a legend retold in Skáldskaparmál and Hrólf Kraki s saga in which King Hrolf and his men scattered gold on the plains  vellir  of the river Fýri south of Gamla Uppsala to delay their pursuers   Fróða fáglýjaðra þýja meldr  flour of Fróði s hapless slaves  alludes to the Grottasöng legend and is another kenning for  gold    móður hold mellu dolgs  flesh of mother of enemy of giantess  is the Earth  Jörd   personified as a goddess who was the mother of Thor  the enemy of the Jotuns   9  Old English and other kennings  The practice of forming kennings has traditionally been seen as a common Germanic inheritance  but this has been disputed since  among the early Germanic languages  their use is largely restricted to Old Norse and Old English poetry  A possible early kenning for  gold   walha kurna  Roman Gallic grain   is attested in the Ancient Nordic runic inscription on the Tjurkö  I  C bracteate  Kennings are virtually absent from the surviving corpus of continental West Germanic verse  the Old Saxon Heliand contains only one example  lîk hamo “body raiment”   “body”  Heliand 3453 b   a compound which  in any case  is normal in West Germanic and North Germanic prose  Old English līchama  Old High German lîchamo  lîchinamo  Dutch lichaam  Old Icelandic líkamr  líkami  Old Swedish līkhamber  Swedish lekamen  Danish and Norwegian Bokmål legeme  Norwegian Nynorsk lekam    Old English kennings are all of the simple type  possessing just two elements  e g  for “sea”  seġl rād “sail road”  Beowulf 1429 b   swan rād “swan road”  Beowulf 200 a   bæð weġ “bath way”  Andreas 513 a   hron rād “whale road”  Beowulf 10   hwæl weġ “whale way”  The Seafarer 63 a   Most Old English examples take the form of compound words in which the first element is uninflected   heofon candel  “sky candle”   “the sun”  Exodus 115 b   Kennings consisting of a genitive phrase occur too  but rarely  heofones ġim “sky’s jewel”   “the sun”  The Phoenix 183    Old English poets often place a series of synonyms in apposition  and these may include kennings  loosely or strictly defined  as well as the literal referent  Hrōðgar maþelode  helm Scyldinga       “Hrothgar  helm   protector  lord  of the Scyldings  said      ”  Beowulf 456    10  Modern usage  John Steinbeck used an approximation of kennings in his 1950 novella Burning Bright  which was adapted into a Broadway play that same year  According to Steinbeck biographer Jay Parini   11  See also  Elegant variation  Heiti  List of kennings  Metonymy  Synecdoche  12  Notes  13  References
