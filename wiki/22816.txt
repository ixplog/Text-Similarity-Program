Outcome based education  OBE  is an educational theory that bases each part of an educational system around goals  outcomes   By the end of the educational experience each student should have achieved the goal  There is no specified style of teaching or assessment in OBE instead classes  opportunities  and assessments should all be based around helping students achieve the specified outcomes   Outcome based methods have been adopted in education systems around the world  at multiple levels  Australia and South Africa adopted OBE policies in the early 1990s but have since been phased out  The United States has had an OBE program in place since 1994 that has been adapted over the years  In 2005 Hong Kong adopted an outcome based approach for its universities  Malaysia implemented OBE in all of their public schools systems in 2008  The European Union has proposed an education shift to focus on outcomes  across the EU  In an international effort to accept OBE The Washington Accord was created in 1989  it is an agreement to accept undergraduate engineering degrees that were obtained using OBE methods  As of 2014 the signatories Australia  Canada  Taiwan  Hong Kong  India  Ireland  Japan  Korea  Malaysia  New Zealand  Russia  Singapore  South Africa  Sri Lanka  Turkey  the United Kingdom and the United States   1  Differences from traditional education methods  In a traditional education system  students are given grades and rankings compared to each other  Content and performance expectations are based primarily on what was taught in the past to students of a given age  The goal of traditional education was to present the knowledge and skills of an older generation to the new generation of students  and to provide students with an environment in which to learn  The process paid little attention  beyond the classroom teacher  to whether or not students learn any of the material   2  Benefits of OBE  2 1  Clarity  The focus on outcomes creates a clear expectation of what needs to be accomplished by the end of the course  Students will understand what is expected of them and teachers will know what they need to teach during the course  Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved  Each team member  or year in school  will have a clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished in each class  or at each level  allowing students to progress  Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon  they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome   2 2  Flexibility  With a clear sense of what needs to be accomplished  instructors will be able to structure their lessons around the student’s needs  OBE does not specify a specific method of instruction  leaving instructors free to teach their students using any method  Instructors will also be able to recognize diversity among students by using various teaching and assessment techniques during their class  OBE is meant to be a student centered learning model  Teachers are meant to guide and help the students understand the material in any way necessary  study guides  and group work are some of the methods instructors can use to facilitate students learning   2 3  Comparison  OBE provides an opportunity for comparison across institutions  On an individual level  institutions can look at what outcomes a student has achieved to decide what level the student would be at within a new institution  On an institutional level  institutions can compare themselves  by checking to see what outcomes they have in common  and find places where they may need improvement  based on the achievement of outcomes at other institutions  The ability to compare easily across institutions allows students to move between institutions with relative ease  The institutions can compare outcomes to determine what credits to award the student  The clearly articulated outcomes should allow institutions to assess the student’s achievements rapidly  leading to increased movement of students  These outcomes also work for school to work transitions  A potential employer can look at records of the potential employee to determine what outcomes they have achieved  They can then determine if the potential employee has the skills necessary for the job   2 4  Involvement  Student involvement in the classroom is a key part of OBE  students are expected to do their own learning  so that they gain a full understanding of the material  Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning  and they should learn more through this individual learning  Another aspect of involvement is parental  and community involvement  while developing curriculum  or making changes to it  OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system  or at a local level  Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community  and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school   3  Drawbacks of OBE  3 1  Definition  The definitions of the outcomes decided upon are subject to interpretation by those implementing them  Across different programs or even different instructors outcomes could be interpreted differently  leading to a difference in education  even though the same outcomes were said to be achieved  By outlining specific outcomes  a holistic approach to learning is lost  Learning can find itself reduced to something that is specific  measurable  and observable  As a result  outcomes are not yet widely recognized as a valid way of conceptualizing what learning is about   3 2  Assessment problems  When determining if an outcome has been achieved assessments may become too mechanical  looking only to see if the student has acquired the knowledge  The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways may not be the focus of the assessment  The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students  who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained  Instructors are faced with a challenge  they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different from what they are accustomed to  In regards to giving assessments they must be willing to put in the time required to create a valid  reliable assessment  that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information  while remaining objective   3 3  Generality  Education outcomes can lead to a constrained nature of teaching and assessment  Assessing liberal outcomes such as creativity  respect for self and others  responsibility  and self sufficiency  can become problematic  There is not a measurable  observable  or specific way to determine if a student has achieved these outcomes  Due to the nature of specific outcomes  OBE may actually work against its ideals of serving and creating individuals that have achieved many outcomes   3 4  Involvement  Parental involvement  as discussed in the benefits section can also be a drawback  if parents and community members are not willing to express their opinions on the quality of the education system  the system may not see a need for improvement  and not change to meet student’s needs  Parents may also become too involved  requesting too many changes  so that important improvements get lost with other changes that are being suggested  Instructors will also find that their work is increased  they must work to first understand the outcome  then build a curriculum around each outcome they are required to meet  Instructors have found that implementing multiple outcomes is difficult to do equally  especially in primary school  Instructors will also find their work load increased if they chose to use an assessment method that evaluates students holistically   4  Adoption and removal  4 1  Australia  In the early 1990s all states and territories in Australia developed intended curriculum documents largely based on OBE for their primary and secondary schools  Criticism arose shortly after implementation  Critics argued that no evidence existed that OBE could be implemented successfully on a large scale  in either the United States or Australia  An evaluation of Australian schools found that implementing OBE was difficult  Teachers felt overwhelmed by the amount of expected achievement outcomes  Educators believed that the curriculum outcomes did not attend to the needs of the students or teachers  Critics felt that too many expected outcomes left students with shallow understanding of the material  Many of Australia’s current education policies have moved away from OBE and towards a focus on fully understanding the essential content  rather than learning more content with less understanding   4 2  European Union  In December 2012  the European Commission presented a new strategy to decrease youth employment rate  which is close to 23% across the European Union  The European Qualifications Framework calls for a shift towards learning outcomes in primary and secondary schools throughout the EU  Students are expected to learn skills that they will need when they complete their education  It also calls for lessons to have a stronger link to employment through work based learning  Work based learning for students should also lead to recognition of vocational training for these students  The program also sets goals for learning foreign languages  and for teachers continued education  It also highlights the importance of using technology  especially the internet  in learning to make it relevant to students   4 3  Hong Kong  Hong Kong’s University Grants Committee adopted an outcomes based approach to teaching and learning in 2005  No specific approach was created leaving universities to design the approach themselves  Universities were also left with a goal of ensuring an education for their students that will contribute to social and economic development  as defined by the community in which the university resides  With little to no direction or feedback from the outside university’s will have to determine if their approach is achieving its goals on their own   4 4  Malaysia  OBE has been practiced in Malaysia since the 1950s  however  as of 2008 OBE is being implemented at all levels of education  especially tertiary education  This change is a result of the belief that the education system used prior to OBE inadequately prepared graduates for life outside of school  The Ministry of Higher Education has pushed for this change because of the number of unemployed graduates  Findings in 2006 state that nearly 70% of graduates from public universities were considered unemployed  A further study of those graduates found that they felt they lacked  job experience  communication skills  and qualifications relevant to the current job market  The Malaysian Qualifications Agency  MQA  was created to oversee quality of education and to ensure outcomes were being reached  The MQA created a framework that includes eight levels of qualification within higher education  covering three sectors  skills  vocational and technical  and academic  Along with meeting the standards set by the MQA  universities set and monitor their own outcome expectations for students  4 5  South Africa  OBE was introduced to South Africa in the late 1990s by the post apartheid government as part of its Curriculum 2005 program    Initial support for the program derived from anti apartheid education policies  The policy also gained support from the labor movements that borrowed ideas about competency based education  and Vocational education from New Zealand and Australia  as well as the labor movement that critiqued the apartheid education system  With no strong alternative proposals  the idea of outcome based education  and a national qualification framework  became the policy of the African National Congress government  This policy was believed to be a democratization of education  people would have a say in what they wanted the outcomes of education to be  It was also believed to be a way to increase education standards and increase the availability of education  The National Qualifications Framework  NQF  went into effect in 1997  In 2001 people realized that the intended effects were not being seen  By 2006 no proposals to change the system had been accepted by the government  causing a hiatus of the program  The program came to be viewed as a failure and a new curriculum improvement process was announced in 2010  slated to be implemented between 2012 and 2014   4 6  United States  In 1983 a report from the National Commission on Excellence in Education declared that American education standards were eroding  that young people in the United States were not learning enough  In 1989 President Bush and the nation’s governors set national goals to be achieved by the year 2000  GOALS 2000  Educate America Act was signed in March 1994  The goal of this new reform was to show that results were being achieved in schools  In 2001 the No Child Left Behind Act took the place of Goals 2000  It mandated certain measurements as a condition of receiving federal education funds  States are free to set their own standards  but the federal law mandates public reporting of math and reading test scores for disadvantaged demographic subgroups  including racial minorities  low income students  and special education students  Various consequences for schools that do not make  adequate yearly progress  are included in the law  In 2010 President Obama proposed improvements for the program  In 2012 the U S  Department of Education invited states to request flexibility waivers in exchange for rigorous plans designed to improve students education in the state   5  See also  Apprenticeship  Mastery learning  Traditional mathematics  Washington Accord  6  References  7  Further reading  Castleberry  Thomas  2006
