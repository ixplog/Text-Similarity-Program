The Motion Picture Patents Company  MPPC  also known as the Edison Trust   founded in December 1908  was a trust of all the major American film companies  Edison  Biograph  Vitagraph  Essanay  Selig Polyscope  Lubin Manufacturing  Kalem Company  Star Film Paris  American Pathé   the leading film distributor  George Kleine  and the biggest supplier of raw film stock  Eastman Kodak  The MPPC ended the domination of foreign films on American screens  standardized the manner in which films were distributed and exhibited in America  and improved the quality of American motion pictures by internal competition  But it also discouraged its members  entry into feature film production  and the use of outside financing  both to its members  eventual detriment   1  Creation  The MPPC was preceded by the Edison licensing system  in effect in 1907–1908  on which the MPPC was modeled  Since the 1890s  Thomas Edison owned most of the major American patents relating to motion picture cameras  The Edison Manufacturing Company s patent lawsuits against each of its domestic competitors crippled the American film industry  reducing American production mainly to two companies  Edison and Biograph  which used a different camera design  This left Edison s other rivals with little recourse but to import French and British films   Since 1902  Edison had also been notifying distributors and exhibitors that if they did not use Edison machines and films exclusively  they would be subject to litigation for supporting filmmaking that infringed Edison s patents  Exhausted by the lawsuits  Edison s competitors — Essanay  Kalem  Pathé Frères  Selig  and Vitagraph — approached him in 1907 to negotiate a licensing agreement  which Lubin was also invited to join  The one notable filmmaker excluded from the licensing agreement was Biograph  which Edison hoped to squeeze out of the market  No further applicants could become licensees  The purpose of the licensing agreement  according to an Edison lawyer  was to  preserve the business of present manufacturers and not to throw the field open to all competitors    1 1  The addition of Biograph  Biograph retaliated for being frozen out of the Trust agreement by purchasing the patent to the Latham film loop  a key feature of virtually all motion picture cameras then in use  Edison sued to gain control of the patent  however  after a federal court upheld the validity of the patent in 1907  Edison began negotiation with Biograph in May 1908 to reorganize the Edison licensing system  The resulting trust pooled 16 motion picture patents  Ten were considered of minor importance  the remaining key six pertained one each to films  cameras  and the Latham loop  and three to projectors   2  Policies  The MPPC eliminated the outright sale of films to distributors and exhibitors  replacing it with rentals  which allowed quality control over prints that had formerly been exhibited long past their prime  The Patents Company also established a uniform rental rate for all licensed films  thereby removing price as a factor for the exhibitor in film selection  in favor of selection made on quality  which in turn encouraged the upgrading of production values   However  the MPPC also established a monopoly on all aspects of filmmaking  Eastman Kodak  which owned the patent on raw film stock  was a member of the Trust and thus agreed to only sell stock to other members  Likewise  the Trust s control of patents on motion picture cameras ensured that only MPPC studios were able to film  and the projector patents allowed the Trust to make licensing agreements with distributors and theaters – and thus determine who screened their films and where   The patents owned by the MPPC allowed them to use federal law enforcement officials to enforce their licensing agreements and to prevent unauthorized use of their cameras  films  projectors  and other equipment  In some cases  however  the MPPC made use of hired thugs and mob connections to violently disrupt productions that were not licensed by the Trust   2 1  Content  The MPPC also strictly regulated the production content of their films  primarily as a means of cost control  Films were initially limited to one reel in length  13–17 minutes   although competition by independent and foreign producers by 1912 led to the introduction of two reelers  and by 1913  three  and four reelers   3  Backlash and decline  Many independent filmmakers  who controlled from one quarter to one third of the domestic marketplace  responded to the creation of the MPPC by moving their operations to Hollywood  whose distance from Edison s home base of New Jersey made it more difficult for the MPPC to enforce its patents  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  which is headquartered in San Francisco  California  and covers the area  was averse to enforcing patent claims  Southern California was also chosen because of its beautiful year round weather and varied countryside  its topography  semi arid climate and widespread irrigation gave its landscapes the ability to offer motion picture shooting scenes set in deserts  jungles and great mountains   The reasons for The MPPC s decline are manifold  The first blow came in 1911  when Eastman Kodak modified its exclusive contract with the MPPC  to allow Kodak to sell its raw film stock  which led the industry in quality and price  to unlicensed independents  The number of theaters exhibiting independent films grew by 33 percent within twelve months  to half of all houses   Another reason was the MPPC s overestimation of the efficiency of controlling the motion picture industry through patent litigation and the exclusion of independents from licensing  The slow process of using detectives to investigate patent infringements  and of obtaining injunctions against the infringers  was outpaced by the dynamic rise of new companies in diverse locations   Despite the rise in popularity of feature films in 1912–1913 from independent producers and foreign imports  the MPPC was very reluctant to make the changes necessary to distribute such longer films  Edison  Biograph  Essanay  and Vitagraph did not release their first features until 1914  after dozens  if not hundreds  of feature films had been released by independents   Patent royalties to the MPPC ended in September 1913 with the expiration of the last of the patents filed in the mid 1890s at the dawn of commercial film production and exhibition  Thus the MPPC lost the ability to control the American film industry through patent licensing  and had to rely instead on its subsidiary  the General Film Company  formed in 1910  which monopolized film distribution in America   The outbreak of World War I in 1914 cut off most of the European market  which played a much more significant part of the revenue and profit for MPPC members than for the independents  who concentrated on Westerns produced for a primarily American market   The end came with a federal court decision in United States v  Motion Picture Patents Co  on October 1  1915  which ruled that the MPPC s acts went  far beyond what was necessary to protect the use of patents or the monopoly which went with them  and was therefore an illegal restraint of trade under the Sherman Antitrust Act  An appellate court dismissed the Patent Company s appeal  and officially terminated the MPPC in 1918   4  See also  History of cinema  5  References  6  External links   New York Times October 2  1915
