A stripped deck is a set of playing cards from which some cards have been removed  The removed cards are usually in the range from 2 to 9  The standard Anglo French suited deck of 52 cards itself can be regarded as a stripped tarot deck from which the 21 numbered trumps  the fool and the 4 mounted knights have been removed  Many card games use stripped decks  and stripped decks for popular games are commercially available   1  Piquet deck  A French suited deck of 32 cards  consisting of 7  8  9  10  Jack  Queen  King and Ace in four suits each  is used in the two player game Piquet  which dates back to the 16th century  Games played with a piquet deck  or the equivalent German  or Swiss suited decks  are still among the most popular in some parts of Europe  This includes belote and klaverjas  the national games of France and the Netherlands  respectively  and skat  the German national game  which is also played with the equivalent German suited decks in some regions   Bezique is played with two piquet decks   2  Stripped decks in poker variants  Stripped decks are used in certain poker variants  For example  the Australian game of Manila uses a piquet deck  and Mexican stud is played with the 8s  9s  and 10s removed from the deck  and a joker added   This may require adjusting hand values  in both of these games  a flush ranks above a full house  because having fewer cards of each suit available makes flushes rarer   A hand such as 6 7 J Q K plays as a straight in Mexican stud  skipping over the removed ranks  Some places may allow a hand such as 10 9 8 7 A to play as a straight  by analogy to a wheel  in the 32 card game  the A playing low and skipping over the removed ranks  although this is not the case in Manila   Finally  the relative frequency of straights versus three of a kind is also sensitive to the deck composition  and to the number of cards dealt   so some places may consider three of a kind to be superior to a straight  but the difference is small enough that this complication is not necessary for most games  Similarly  a full house tends to occur more often than a flush in a piquet deck  due to the increased frequency of each playing card rank  creating a change in poker combination ranking   Five card stud is also often played with a piquet deck  In lively home games it might work better to only strip three ranks  2s through 4s  with seven or eight players  with only two or three players 7s and 8s could be stripped as well  leaving the same 24 card deck used in euchre  In any of these cases  a flush should rank above a full house  in a 24 card deck it is actually rarer than four of a kind  but is rarely played that flushes are superior to four of a kind   Stripped deck five card stud is a game particularly well suited to cheating by collusion  because it is easy for partners to signal a single hole card and the relative value of knowing the location of a single card is higher than with a full deck   3  Other games  The game of euchre is also played with a 24 card stripped deck  consisting of only 9 10 J Q K A of each suit  the 2 8 being stripped from the deck  The game of pinochle is played with 48 cards  consisting of a doubled euchre deck  that is  two copies of 9 A of each suit    4  See also  Card games  Playing cards  5  References
