A two party system is a system where two major political parties dominate politics within a government  One of the two parties typically holds a majority in the legislature and is usually referred to as the majority party while the other is the minority party  The term has different senses  For example  in the United States  Jamaica  and Malta  the sense of two party system describes an arrangement in which all or nearly all elected officials only belong to one of the two major parties  and third parties rarely win any seats in the legislature  In such arrangements  two party systems are thought to result from various factors like winner takes all election rules  In such systems  while chances for third party candidates winning election to major national office are remote  it is possible for groups within the larger parties  or in opposition to one or both of them  to exert influence on the two major parties  In contrast  in the United Kingdom and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere  the term two party system is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature  and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest   1  Examples  There is strong agreement that the United States has a two party system  historically  there have been few instances in which third party candidates won an election  In the First Party System  only the Federalist Party and Thomas Jefferson s Republican Party were significant political parties  Toward the end of the First Party System  the Republicans held a single party system  primarily under the Presidency of James Monroe   Under the Second Party System  the Republican Party split during the election of 1824 into Adams  Men and Jackson s Men  In 1828  the modern Democratic Party formed in support of Andrew Jackson  The National Republicans were formed in support of John Quincy Adams  After the National Republicans collapsed  the Whig Party and the Free Soil Party quickly formed and collapsed  In 1854  the modern Republican Party formed from a loose coalition of former Whigs  Free Soilers and other anti slavery activists   During the Third Party System  the Republican Party was the dominant political faction  but the Democrats held a strong  loyal coalition in the Solid South  During the Fourth Party System  the Republicans remained the dominant Presidential party  although Democrats Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson were both elected to two terms  In 1932  at the onset of the Fifth Party System  Democrats took firm control of national politics with the landslide victories of Franklin D  Roosevelt in four consecutive elections  Other than the two terms of Republican Dwight Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961  Democrats retained firm control of the Presidency until the mid 1960s  Since the mid 1960s  despite a number of land slides  such as Ronald Reagan carrying 49 states and 58% of the popular vote over Walter Mondale in 1984   Presidential elections have been competitive between the predominant Republican and Democratic parties and no one party has been able to hold the Presidency for more than three consecutive terms  In the election of 2012  only 4% separated the popular vote between Barack Obama  51%  and Mitt Romney  47%   although Obama won the electoral vote by a landslide  332 206    Throughout every American party system  no third party has won a Presidential election or majorities in either house of Congress  Despite that  third parties and third party candidates have gained traction and support  In the election of 1912  Theodore Roosevelt won 27% of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes running as a Progressive  In the 1992 Presidential election  Ross Perot won 19% of the popular vote but no electoral votes running as an Independent   In countries such as Britain and Spain  two major parties emerge which have strong influence and tend to elect most of the candidates  but a multitude of lesser parties exist with varying degrees of influence  and sometimes these lesser parties are able to elect officials who participate in the legislature  A report in the Christian Science Monitor  for example  suggested that Spain was moving towards a  greater two party system  while acknowledging that Spain has  many small parties   In political systems based on the Westminster system  which is a particular style of parliamentary democracy based on the British model and found in many commonwealth countries  a majority party will form the government and the minority party will form the opposition  and coalitions of lesser parties are possible  in the rare circumstance in which neither party is the majority  a hung parliament arises  Sometimes these systems are described as two party systems but they are usually referred to as multi party systems  There is not always a sharp boundary between a two party system and a multi party system   Generally  a two party system becomes a dichotomous division of the political spectrum with an ostensibly right wing and left wing party  the Nationalist Party vs  the Labour Party in Malta  Liberal vs  Labor in Australia  Republicans vs  Democrats in the United States and the Conservative Party vs  the Labour Party in the United Kingdom   Other parties in these countries may have seen candidates elected to local or subnational office  however  Historian John Hicks claims that the United States has never possessed for any considerable period of time the two party system in its pure and undefiled form   In some governments  certain chambers may resemble a two party system and others a multi party system  For example  the politics of Australia are largely two party  if the Liberal Party and National Party are considered the same party at a national level due to their long standing alliance  for the Australian House of Representatives  which is elected by Instant Runoff Voting   known within Australia as preferential voting   However  third parties are more common in the Australian Senate  which uses a proportional voting system more amenable to minor parties   India too is showing characteristics of two party system with United Progressive Alliance  UPA  and National Democratic Alliance  NDA  as the two main players  It is to be noted that both UPA and NDA are not two political parties but alliances of several smaller parties  Other smaller parties not aligned with either NDA or UPA exist  and overall command about 20% of the 2009 seats in the Lok Sabha   Malta are somewhat unusual in that while the electoral system is single transferable vote  STV   traditionally associated with proportional representation  minor parties have not earned much success  No third parties won any seats in the Parliament in Malta s most recent election  for example  The Labour Party and the Nationalist Party are the dominant parties   South Korea has a multi party system that has sometimes been described as having characteristics of a two party system   Historically  Brazil had a two party system during its military dictatorship  1964–1985    2  Comparisons with other party systems  Two party systems can be compared with   Multi party systems  In these  the effective number of parties is greater than two but usually fewer than five  in a two party system  the effective number of parties is two  according to one analysis  the actual average number of parties varies between 1 7 and 2 1   The parties in a multi party system can control government separately or as a coalition  in a two party system  however  coalition governments rarely form  Examples of nations with multi party systems include Brazil  Canada  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  India  Pakistan  Indonesia  Ireland  Israel  Italy  Mexico  Nepal  the Netherlands  New Zealand  Norway  Portugal  Spain  Sweden and the Taiwan   Single party systems or dominant party systems happen in nations where no more than one party is codified in law and or officially recognized  or where alternate parties are restricted by the dominant party which wields power  Examples include rule by the Communist Party of China and the People s Action Party of Singapore   3  Causes  There are several reasons why  in some systems  two major parties dominate the political landscape  There has been speculation that a two party system arose in the United States from early political battling between the federalists and anti federalists in the first few decades after the ratification of the Constitution  according to several views  In addition  there has been more speculation that the winner takes all electoral system as well as particular state and federal laws regarding voting procedures helped to cause a two party system   Political scientists such as Maurice Duverger and William H  Riker claim that there are strong correlations between voting rules and type of party system  Jeffrey D  Sachs agreed that there was a link between voting arrangements and the effective number of parties  Sachs explained how the First Past The Post voting arrangement tended to promote a two party system   Consider a system in which voters can vote for any candidate from any one of many parties  Suppose further that if a party gets 15% of votes  then that party will win 15% of the seats in the legislature  This is termed proportional representation or more accurately as party proportional representation  Political scientists speculate that proportional representation leads logically to multi party systems  since it allows new parties to build a niche in the legislature   In contrast  a voting system that allows only a single winner for each possible legislative seat is sometimes termed a plurality voting system or single winner voting system and is usually described under the heading of a winner舑takes舑all arrangement  Each voter can cast a single vote for any candidate within any given legislative district  but the candidate with the most votes wins the seat  although variants  such as requiring a majority  are sometimes used  What happens is that in a general election  a party that consistently comes in third in every district is unlikely to win any legislative seats even if there is a significant proportion of the electorate favoring its positions  This arrangement strongly favors large and well舑organized political parties that are able to appeal to voters in many districts and hence win many seats  and discourages smaller or regional parties  Politically oriented people consider their only realistic way to capture political power is to be either a Republican or Democrat   In the U S   forty eight states have a standard winner takes all electoral system for amassing presidential votes in the Electoral College system  The winner舑takes舑all principle applies in presidential elections  since if a presidential candidate gets the most votes in any particular state  all of the electoral votes from that state are awarded  In all but two states  Maine and Nebraska  the presidential candidate winning a plurality of votes wins all of the electoral votes  a practice called the unit rule   Duverger concluded that  plurality election single ballot procedures are likely to produce two party systems  whereas proportional representation and runoff designs encourage multipartyism   He suggested there were two reasons why winner舑takes舑all systems leads to a two party system  First  the weaker parties are pressured to form an alliance  sometimes called a fusion  to try to become big enough to challenge a large dominant party and  in so doing  gain political clout in the legislature  Second  voters learn  over time  not to vote for candidates outside of one of the two large parties since their votes for third party candidates are usually ineffectual  As a result  weaker parties are eliminated by voters over time  Duverger pointed to statistics and tactics to suggest that voters tended to gravitate towards one of the two main parties  a phenomenon which he called polarization  and tend to shun third parties  For example  some analysts suggest that the Electoral College system in the United States  by favoring a system of winner舑takes舑all in presidential elections  is a structural choice favoring only two major parties   Gary Cox suggested that America s two party system was highly related with economic prosperity in the country   An effort in 2012 by centrist groups to promote ballot access by Third Party candidates called Americans Elect spent $15 million to get ballot access but failed to elect any candidates  The lack of choice in a two party model in politics has often been compared to the variety of choices in the marketplace   4  Third parties  Third parties  meaning a party other than one of the two dominant parties  are possible in two party systems  but they are often unlikely to exert much influence by gaining control of legislatures or by winning elections  While there are occasional opinions in the media expressed about the possibility of third parties emerging in the United States  for example  political insiders such as the 1980 presidential candidate John Anderson think the chances of one appearing in the early twenty first century is remote  A report in The Guardian suggested that American politics has been  stuck in a two way fight between Republicans and Democrats  since the Civil War  and that third party runs had little meaningful success   Third parties in a two party system can be   built around a particular ideology or interest group  split off from one of the major parties or  focused on a charismatic individual  When third parties are built around an ideology which is at odds with the majority mindset  many members belong to such a party not for the purpose of expecting electoral success but rather for personal or psychological reasons  In the U S   third parties include older ones such as the Libertarian Party and the Green Party and newer ones such as the Pirate Party  Many believe that third parties don t affect American politics by winning elections  but they can act as  spoilers  by taking votes from one of the two major parties  They act like barometers of change in the political mood since they push the major parties to consider their demands  An analysis in New York Magazine by Ryan Lizza in 2006 suggested that third parties arose from time to time in the nineteenth century around single issue movements such as abolition  women s suffrage  and the direct election of senators  but were less prominent in the twentieth century   A so called third party in the United Kingdom are the Liberal Democrats  In the 2010 election  the Liberal Democrats received 23% of the votes but only 9% of the seats in the House of Commons  While electoral results do not necessarily translate into legislative seats  the Liberal Democrats can exert influence if there is a situation such as a hung parliament  In this instance  neither of the two main parties  at present  the Conservative Party and the Labour Party  have sufficient authority to run the government  Accordingly  the Liberal Democrats can in theory exert tremendous influence in such a situation since they can ally with one of the two main parties to form a coalition  This happened in the Coalition government of 2010  Yet in that more than 13% of the seats in the British House of Commons are held in 2011 by representatives of political parties other than the two leading political parties of that nation  contemporary Britain is considered by some to be a multi party system  and not a two party system   5  Advantages  Some historians have suggested that two party systems promote centrism and encourages political parties to find common positions which appeal to wide swaths of the electorate  It can lead to political stability which leads  in turn  to economic growth  Historian Patrick Allitt of the Teaching Company suggested that it is difficult to overestimate the long term economic benefits of political stability  Sometimes two party systems have been seen as preferable to multi party systems because they are simpler to govern  with less fractiousness and greater harmony  since it discourages radical minor parties  while multi party systems can sometimes lead to hung parliaments  Italy  with a multi party system  has had years of divisive politics since 2000  although analyst Silvia Aloisi suggested in 2008 that the nation may be moving closer to a two party arrangement  The two party has been identified as simpler since there are fewer voting choices  One analyst suggested the two party system  in contrast with proportional representation  prevented excessive government interference with economic policy   6  Disadvantages  Two party systems have been criticized for downplaying alternative views  being less competitive  encouraging voter apathy since there is a perception of fewer choices  and putting a damper on debate within a nation  In a proportional representation system  lesser parties can moderate policy since they are not usually eliminated from government  One analyst suggested the two party approach may not promote inter party compromise but may encourage partisanship  In The Tyranny of the Two舑party system  Lisa Jane Disch criticizes two party systems for failing to provide enough options since only two choices are permitted on the ballot  She wrote   There have been arguments that the winner take all mechanism discourages independent or third party candidates from running for office or promulgating their views  Ross Perot s former campaign manager wrote that the problem with having only two parties is that the nation loses  the ability for things to bubble up from the body politic and give voice to things that aren’t being voiced by the major parties   One analyst suggested that parliamentary systems  which typically are multi party in nature  lead to a better  centralization of policy expertise  in government  Multi party governments permit wider and more diverse viewpoints in government  and encourage dominant parties to make deals with weaker parties to form winning coalitions  While there is considerable debate about the relative merits of a constitutional arrangement such as that of the United States versus a parliamentary arrangement such as Britain  analysts have noted that most democracies around the world have chosen the British multi party model  Analyst Chris Weigant of the Huffington Post wrote that  the parliamentary system is inherently much more open to minority parties getting much better representation than third parties do in the American system   After an election in which the party changes  there can be a “polar shift in policy making” when voters react to changes   7  History  7 1  Beginnings of parties in Britain  The two party system  in the sense of the looser definition  where two parties dominate politics but in which third parties can elect members and gain some representation in the legislature  can be traced to the development of political parties in the United Kingdom  There was a division in English politics at the time of the Civil War and Glorious Revolution in the late 17th century  The Whigs supported Protestant constitutional monarchy against absolute rule and the Tories  originating in the Royalist  or  Cavalier   faction of the English Civil War  were conservative royalist supporters of a strong monarchy as a counterbalance to the republican tendencies of Parliament  In the following century  the Whig party s support base widened to include emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants   The basic matters of principle that defined the struggle between the two factions  were concerning the nature of constitutional monarchy  the desirability of a Catholic king  the extension of religious toleration to nonconformist Protestants  and other issues that had been put on the liberal agenda through the political concepts propounded by John Locke  Algernon Sidney and others   Vigorous struggle between the two factions characterised the period from the Glorious Revolution to the 1715 Hanoverian succession  over the legacy of the overthrow of the Stuart dynasty and the nature of the new constitutional state  This proto two party system fell into relative abeyance after the accession to the throne of George I and the consequent period of Whig supremacy under Robert Walpole  during which the Tories were systematically purged from high positions in government  However  although the Tories were dismissed from office for half a century  they still retained a measure of party cohesion under William Wyndham and acted as a united  though unavailing  opposition to Whig corruption and scandals  At times they cooperated with the  Opposition Whigs   Whigs who were in opposition to the Whig government  however  the ideological gap between the Tories and the Opposition Whigs prevented them from coalescing as a single party   7 2  Emergence of the two party system in Britain  The old Whig leadership dissolved in the 1760s into a decade of factional chaos with distinct  Grenvillite    Bedfordite    Rockinghamite   and  Chathamite  factions successively in power  and all referring to themselves as  Whigs   Out of this chaos  the first distinctive parties emerged  The first such party was the Rockingham Whigs under the leadership of Charles Watson Wentworth and the intellectual guidance of the political philosopher Edmund Burke  Burke laid out a philosophy that described the basic framework of the political party as  a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest  upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed   As opposed to the instability of the earlier factions  which were often tied to a particular leader and could disintegrate if removed from power  the two party system was centred on a set of core principles held by both sides and that allowed the party out of power to remain as the Loyal Opposition to the governing party   A genuine two party system began to emerge  with the accession to power of William Pitt the Younger in 1783 leading the new Tories  against a reconstituted  Whig  party led by the radical politician Charles James Fox   The two party system matured in the early 19th century era of political reform  when the franchise was widened and politics entered into the basic divide between conservatism and liberalism that has fundamentally endured up to the present  The modern Conservative Party was created out of the  Pittite  Tories by Robert Peel  who issued the Tamworth Manifesto in 1834 which set out the basic principles of Conservatism    the necessity in specific cases of reform in order to survive  but an opposition to unnecessary change  that could lead to  a perpetual vortex of agitation   Meanwhile  the Whigs  along with free trade Tory followers of Robert Peel  and independent Radicals  formed the Liberal Party under Lord Palmerston in 1859  and transformed into a party of the growing urban middle class  under the long leadership of William Ewart Gladstone  The two party system had come of age at the time of Gladstone and his Conservative rival Benjamin Disraeli after the 1867 Reform Act   7 3  History of American political parties  Although the Founding Fathers of the United States did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan  early political controversies in the 1790s saw the emergence of a proto two party political system  the Federalist Party and the Democratic Republican Party  centred on the differing views on federal government powers of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and James Madison  However  a consensus reached on these issues ended party politics in 1816 for a decade  a period commonly known as the Era of Good Feelings   Partisan politics revived in 1829 with the split of the Democratic Republican Party into the Jacksonian Democrats led by Andrew Jackson  and the Whig Party  led by Henry Clay  The former evolved into the modern Democratic Party and the latter was replaced with the Republican Party as one of the two main parties in the 1850s   8  See also  Duverger s law  Multi party system  Single party system  Political
