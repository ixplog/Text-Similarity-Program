The Hainish Cycle consists of a number of science fiction novels and stories by Ursula K  Le Guin  It is set in an alternate history future history in which civilizations of human beings on a number of nearby stars  including Terra  Earth   are contacting each other for the first time and establishing diplomatic relations  setting up a confederacy under the guidance of the oldest of the human worlds  peaceful Hain  In this history  human beings did not evolve on Earth but were the result of interstellar colonies planted by Hain long ago  which was followed by a long period when interstellar travel ceased  Some of the races have new genetic traits  a result of ancient Hainish experiments in genetic engineering  including a people who can dream while awake  and a world of androgynous people who only come into active sexuality once a month  and can choose their gender  In keeping with Le Guin s soft science fiction style  the setting is used primarily to explore anthropological and sociological ideas   The Hainish novels The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed have won literary awards  as have the novella The Word for World Is Forest and the short story The Day Before the Revolution   Le Guin herself has discounted the idea of a  Hainish Cycle   writing on her website that  The thing is  they aren t a cycle or a saga  They do not form a coherent history  There are some clear connections among them  yes  but also some extremely murky ones    1  Sequence of writing  In the first three novels—Rocannon s World  Planet of Exile  and City of Illusions—there is or was a League of All Worlds  in City of Illusions  it seems to have been conquered or fragmented by an alien race  called the Shing  from beyond the League   In the fourth  The Left Hand of Darkness  it seems that the planets of the former League of Worlds have re united as the Ekumen  which was founded by the Hainish people   The fifth  The Dispossessed  is the earliest chronologically in the Hainish Cycle  The Cetians have been visited by people from other planets  including Earth and Hain  The various planets are separate  though there is some talk of a union  The idea of an ansible is known but none yet exists  Shevek s new physics may be   in fact  eventually is   the key   The sixth  The Word for World Is Forest  has the League of All Worlds and the ansible as new creations  The term  Ekumen  is not used   Later novels and short stories speak only of the Ekumen  which now includes the Gethenians  who were the subject of The Left Hand of Darkness   2  Back Story  Hundreds of thousands of years ago  the people of Hain colonized a large number of worlds  including Earth  known as Terra  Most of these were similar enough that humans from one world can pass as natives of another  but on some the Old Hainish  Colonisers  used genetic engineering  At least one of the various species of Rokanan are the product of genetic engineering  as are the hilfs of Planet S  whose story has not so far been told   and perhaps the androgynes of Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness  The Ekumen do not know whether the Colonisers sought to adapt humans to varied worlds  were conducting various experiments  or had other reasons   Hainish civilization subsequently collapsed and the colony planets  including Earth  forgot that other human worlds existed  The Ekumen stories tell of the efforts to re establish a civilization on a galactic scale through NAFAL  Nearly As Fast As Light  interstellar travel taking years to travel between stars  although only weeks or months from the viewpoint of the traveler because of time dilation   and through instantaneous interstellar communication using the ansible   This seems to have happened in two phases  First the League of All Worlds was formed  as an alliance of planets  mostly descended from colonization efforts from the planet Hain  uniting the  nine known worlds    along with colonies  presumably  By the time of Rocannon s World it has grown but is also under threat from a distant enemy  It is destroyed by aliens called the Shing  who have the ability to lie in Mindspeech  After the apparent overthrow of the Shing by Terran descendants from Alterra Werel  capable of recognizing the Shing lies   the alliance is eventually reconstructed as the Ekumen  In City of Illusions it is recalled as a league of some 80 worlds   The second phase begins with The Left Hand of Darkness  The 80 plus planets seem to have reunited as the  Ekumen  – a name derived from the Greek  oikoumene   meaning  the inhabited world   though characters occasionally refer to it as  the Household   which is in turn a reference to the Greek  oikos   a word which developed from the same root as oikoumene  Unexplained references are made to the  Age of the Enemy    3  Planets of the Hainish Cycle  The Hainish Cycle contains a very large number of planets and is continually exploring new ones  Genly Ai in The Left Hand of Darkness explains that there are 83 planets in the Ekumen  with Gethen a candidate for becoming the 84th   4  Technology  Societies tend to use sophisticated but unobtrusive technologies  Most notable is the ansible  an instant communication device that keeps worlds in touch with each other   Physical communication is by NAFAL ships  Nearly As Fast As Light  The physics is never explained  the ship vanishes from where it was and reappears somewhere else many years later  The trip takes slightly longer than it would to cross the same distance at the speed of light  but ship time is just a few hours for those on board  It cannot apparently be used for trips within a solar system  Trips can begin or end close to a planet  but if used without a  retemporalizer   there are drastic physical effects at the end of long trips  It is also lethal if the traveler is pregnant   City of Illusions mentions automatic death machines that work on the same principle as the ansible and can strike instantly at distant worlds  Such a device is clearly used in the events of Rocannon s World  They are not mentioned again in later books   Churten theory  as developed by the physicists of Anarres  should allow people to go instantly from solar system to solar system  It is a development of the work of Shevek  whose tale is told in The Dispossessed  Shevek s work made the ansible possible   it is mentioned in his tale that engineers decided they could build it once the correct theory was found  Churten theory offers a way to move whole spacecraft instantaneously  but there are side effects  These are described in two short stories   The Shobies  Story  and  Dancing to Ganam   both of which appeared in A Fisherman of the Inland Sea   The ansible has been adopted by other science fiction and fantasy authors  such as Orson Scott Card  Elizabeth Moon  and Vernor Vinge   5  Post technological worlds  The idea of post technological societies and social and ecological collapse comes into several of these stories  It is portrayed as the end result of the wrong kind of civilizations  i e   competitive  capitalist  patriarchal   dynamic  aggressive  ecology breaking cultures   while successful societies are close to the land  peaceful  non authoritarian  non competitive  static  communitarian  with the holistic outlook of Eastern religions   In City of Illusions  Earth has suffered some sort of collapse in a distant future  losing contact with the stars   In The Dispossessed the ecological disaster of Earth is described  it has become  a planet spoiled by the human species  through wars and runaway industrial development  Global warming has turned it into a polluted desert and ruined the carrying capacity of the land  The population has fallen from 9 billion to half a billion  who only survive by total rationing  labor conscription  euthanasia  forced birth control  and the charity of the Hainish   In  Another Story  in A Fisherman of the Inland Sea  it is mentioned that Earth still suffers badly from pollution   Eleven Soro had a high technology and then a massive crash  as is told in the short story  Solitude  in The Birthday of the World   Hain itself has gone back to a simpler life with high technology only where it is justified  as is told in the first part of  A Man of the People  in Four Ways to Forgiveness  This also seems to apply to planet Ve   Orint and Kheakh are mentioned in passing as worlds that have totally destroyed themselves   In The Left Hand Of Darkness  the planet Gde is described as extremely hot rock and desert  the result of a technological society that  wrecked its ecological balance  some millennia previous  and  burned up its forests for kindling    6  Biology  Most of the people in the tales have a common descent from the planet Hain  which settled many surrounding worlds  Some of them are genetically similar enough to produce children together  The unusual hairiness of the Cetians is mentioned in The Word for World Is Forest and The Dispossessed   though to Cetians  it seems that other types of human have unusually little hair  The Telling includes the detail that the people of Chiffewar are all bald   There are some cases of ancient biological manipulation   Unique among known humans  the Hainish have complete voluntary control of their fertility  In order for a Hainish man and woman to reproduce  they must both consciously choose to produce viable genetic material  which they learn to do in adolescence  The required genetic changes to the Hainish population were made in the far distant past  and apparently took many generations to accomplish   The Left Hand of Darkness mentions that the hilfs of S must have been produced by human genetic manipulation by the ancient Hainish people  along with the Gethenians and the degenerate winged hominoids of Rokanan  We hear no more about the hilfs of S  unless these are the same as the small furry natives of Athshe  who are also of Hainish descent   The hermaphrodite humans of Gethen may have been produced as an adaptation to a harsh climate  or an experiment to see how people would live without gender  Both ideas are mentioned and nothing is definitely settled   The degenerate winged hominoids are seen in Rocannon s World  They live in cities that require much higher technology to build than the rest of the races on Rokanan  but live in bat like societies  hunting for humans and animals on which their larvae feed by sucking their blood   The Matter of Seggri tells us that the extreme gender imbalance of the people of Seggri may be another case of genetic manipulation   Alterrans have distinctive cat like eyes  While normally unable to breed with Earth humans  the latter become sufficiently genetically similar within a few centuries on their planet due to unspecified natural factors  However  that nearly drives the Earth descended colony to extinction due to the genetic differences between mothers and fetuses causing miscarriages  The Alterrans may be another case of genetic manipulation  or a similar natural adaptation themselves   The Shing of City of Illusions are not of Hainish origin and cannot interbreed with Earth humans  They dismiss the report about the human adaptation on Alterra as impossible   7  List of books  7 1  Novels  The order presented here is the internal chronology of
