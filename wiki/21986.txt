Naive Set Theory is a mathematics textbook by Paul Halmos providing an undergraduate introduction to set theory  Originally published by Van Nostrand in 1960  it was reprinted in the Springer Verlag Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics series in 1974   While the title states that it is naive  which is usually taken to mean without axioms  the book does introduce all the axioms of Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects  Where it differs from a  true  axiomatic set theory book is its character  there are no long winded discussions of axiomatic minutiae  and there is next to nothing about advanced topics like large cardinals  Instead  it tries to be intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before   Halmos later stated that it was the fastest book he wrote  taking about six months  and that the book  wrote itself    1  See also  List of publications in mathematics  2  Bibliography  Halmos  Paul  Naive Set Theory  Princeton  NJ  D  Van Nostrand Company  1960  Reprinted by Springer Verlag  New York  1974  ISBN 0 387 90092 6  Springer Verlag edition   Reprinted by Martino Fine Books  2011  ISBN 978 1 61427 131 4  Paperback edition    3  References  4  External links  compiled by the participants of the mathematics stack exchange
