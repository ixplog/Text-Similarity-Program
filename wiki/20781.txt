In abstract algebra  a monoid ring is a ring constructed from a ring and a monoid  just as a group ring is constructed from a ring and a group   1  Definition  Let R be a ring and let G be a monoid  The monoid ring or monoid algebra of G over R  denoted R G  or RG  is the set of formal sums   where for each and rg   0 for all but finitely many g  equipped with coefficient wise addition  and the multiplication in which the elements of R commute with the elements of G  More formally  R G  is the set of functions such that   is finite  equipped with addition of functions  and with multiplication defined by  If G is a group  then R G  is also called the group ring of G over R   2  Universal property  Given R and G  there is a ring homomorphism sending each r to r1  where 1 is the identity element of G   and a monoid homomorphism  where the latter is viewed as a monoid under multiplication  sending each g to 1g  where 1 is the multiplicative identity of R   We have that α r  commutes with β g  for all r in R and g in G   The universal property of the monoid ring states that given a ring S  a ring homomorphism   and a monoid homomorphism to the multiplicative monoid of S  such that α  r  commutes with β  g  for all r in R and g in G  there is a unique ring homomorphism such that composing α and β with γ produces α  and β     3  Augmentation  The augmentation is the ring homomorphism defined by  The kernel of ॑ is called the augmentation ideal  It is a free R module with basis consisting of 1–g for all g in G not equal to 1   4  Examples  Given a ring R and the  additive  monoid of natural numbers N  or  xn  viewed multiplicatively   we obtain the ring R  xn      R x  of polynomials over R  The monoid Nn  with the addition  gives the polynomial ring with n variables  R Nn     R X1       Xn    5  Generalization  If G is a semigroup  the same construction yields a semigroup ring R G    6  See also  Free algebra  7  References  8  Further reading  R Gilmer  Commutative semigroup rings  University of Chicago Press  Chicago–London  1984
