Phonetics  pronounced   from the   phōnē   sound  voice   is a branch of linguistics that comprises the study of the sounds of human speech  or—in the case of sign languages—the equivalent aspects of sign  It is concerned with the physical properties of speech sounds or signs  phones   their physiological production  acoustic properties  auditory perception  and neurophysiological status  Phonology  on the other hand  is concerned with the abstract  grammatical characterization of systems of sounds or signs   The field of phonetics is a multilayered subject of linguistics that focuses on speech  In the case of oral languages there are three basic areas of study   Articulatory phonetics  the study of the production of speech sounds by the articulatory and vocal tract by the speaker   Acoustic phonetics  the study of the physical transmission of speech sounds from the speaker to the listener   Auditory phonetics  the study of the reception and perception of speech sounds by the listener  These areas are inter connected through the common mechanism of sound  such as wavelength  pitch   amplitude  and harmonics   1  History  Phonetics was studied as early as the 3rd century BC in the Indian subcontinent  with account of the place and manner of articulation of consonants in his treatise on Sanskrit  The major Indic alphabets today order their consonants according to classification  The Phoenicians are credited as the first to create a phonetic writing system  from which all major modern phonetic alphabets are now derived   Modern phonetics begins with attempts—such as those of Joshua Steele  in Prosodia Rationalis  1779  and Alexander Melville Bell  in Visible Speech  1867 —to introduce systems of precise notation for speech sounds   2  Phonetic transcription  The International Phonetic Alphabet  IPA  is used as the basis for the phonetic transcription of speech  It is based on the Latin alphabet and is able to transcribe most features of speech such as consonants  vowels  and suprasegmental features  Every documented phoneme available within the known languages in the world is assigned its own corresponding symbol   3  The difference between phonetics and phonology  Phonology concerns itself with systems of phonemes  abstract cognitive units of speech sound or sign which distinguish the words of a language  Phonetics  on the other hand  concerns itself with the production  transmission  and perception of the physical phenomena which are abstracted in the mind to constitute these speech sounds or signs   Using an Edison phonograph  Ludimar Hermann investigated the spectral properties of vowels and consonants  It was in these papers that the term formant was first introduced  Hermann also played vowel recordings made with the Edison phonograph at different speeds in order to test Willis  and Wheatstone s theories of vowel production   4  Relation to phonology  In contrast to phonetics  phonology is the study of how sounds and gestures pattern in and across languages  relating such concerns with other levels and aspects of language  Phonetics deals with the articulatory and acoustic properties of speech sounds  how they are produced  and how they are perceived  As part of this investigation  phoneticians may concern themselves with the physical properties of meaningful sound contrasts or the social meaning encoded in the speech signal  socio phonetics   e g  gender  sexuality  ethnicity  etc    However  a substantial portion of research in phonetics is not concerned with the meaningful elements in the speech signal   While it is widely agreed that phonology is grounded in phonetics  phonology is a distinct branch of linguistics  concerned with sounds and gestures as abstract units  e g   distinctive features  phonemes  mora  syllables  etc   and their conditioned variation  via  e g   allophonic rules  constraints  or derivational rules   Phonology relates to phonetics via the set of distinctive features  which map the abstract representations of speech units to articulatory gestures  acoustic signals  and or perceptual representations   5  Subfields  Phonetics as a research discipline has three main branches   articulatory phonetics is concerned with the articulation of speech  The position  shape  and movement of articulators or speech organs  such as the lips  tongue  and vocal folds   acoustic phonetics is concerned with acoustics of speech  The spectro temporal properties of the sound waves produced by speech  such as their frequency  amplitude  and harmonic structure   auditory phonetics is concerned with speech perception  the perception  categorization  and recognition of speech sounds and the role of the auditory system and the brain in the same   6  Transcription  Phonetic transcription is a system for transcribing sounds that occur in a language  whether oral or sign  The most widely known system of phonetic transcription  the International Phonetic Alphabet  IPA   provides a standardized set of symbols for oral phones  The standardized nature of the IPA enables its users to transcribe accurately and consistently the phones of different languages  dialects  and idiolects  The IPA is a useful tool not only for the study of phonetics  but also for language teaching  professional acting  and speech pathology   7  Applications  Applications of phonetics include   forensic phonetics  the use of phonetics  the science of speech  for forensic  legal  purposes   Speech Recognition  the analysis and transcription of recorded speech by a computer system   8  See also  Experimental phonetics  Index of phonetics articles  International Phonetic Alphabet  Speech processing  Acoustics  Biometric word list  Phonetics
