Neodymium is a chemical element with symbol Nd and atomic number 60  It is a soft silvery metal that tarnishes in air  Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach  It is present in significant quantities in the ore minerals monazite and bastnäsite  Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides  and it is usually refined for general use  Although neodymium is classed as a  rare earth   it is a fairly common element  no rarer than cobalt  nickel  and copper  and is widely distributed in the Earth s crust  Most of the world s neodymium is mined in China   Neodymium compounds were first commercially used as glass dyes in 1927  and they remain a popular additive in glasses  The color of neodymium compounds—due to the Nd3+ ion—is often a reddish purple but it changes with the type of lighting  due to fluorescent effects  Some neodymium doped glasses are also used in lasers that emit infrared with wavelengths between 1047 and 1062 nanometers  These have been used in extremely high power applications  such as experiments in inertial confinement fusion   Neodymium is also used with various other substrate crystals  such as yttrium aluminum garnet in the Nd YAG laser  This laser usually emits infrared at a wavelength of about 1064 nanometers  The Nd YAG laser is one of the most commonly used solid state lasers   Another chief use of neodymium is as a component in the alloys used to make high strength neodymium magnets—powerful permanent magnets  These magnets are widely used in such products as microphones  professional loudspeakers  in ear headphones  and computer hard disks  where low magnet mass or volume  or strong magnetic fields are required  Larger neodymium magnets are used in high power versus weight electric motors  for example in hybrid cars  and generators  for example aircraft and wind turbine electric generators    1  Characteristics  1 1  Physical properties  Neodymium  a rare earth metal  was present in the classical mischmetal at a concentration of about 18%  Metallic neodymium has a bright  silvery metallic luster  but as one of the more reactive lanthanide rare earth metals  it quickly oxidizes in ordinary air  The oxide layer that forms then peels off  and this exposes the metal to further oxidation  Thus a centimeter sized sample of neodymium completely oxidizes within a year   Neodymium commonly exists in two allotropic forms  with a transformation from a double hexagonal to a body centered cubic structure taking place at about 863 °C   1 2  Chemical properties  Neodymium metal tarnishes slowly in air and it burns readily at about 150 °C to form neodymium III  oxide   Neodymium is a quite electropositive element  and it reacts slowly with cold water  but quite quickly with hot water to form neodymium III  hydroxide   Neodymium metal reacts vigorously with all the halogens   Neodymium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions that contain the lilac Nd III  ion  These exist as a  Nd OH2 9 3+ complexes   1 3  Compounds  Neodymium compounds include  halides  neodymium III  fluoride  NdF3   neodymium III  chloride  NdCl3

neodymium is a mixture of five stable isotopes  142Nd  143Nd  145Nd  146Nd and 148Nd  with 142Nd being the most abundant  27 2% of the natural abundance   and two radioisotopes  144Nd and 150Nd  In all  31 radioisotopes of neodymium have been detected   with the most stable radioisotopes being the naturally occurring ones  144Nd  alpha decay with a half life  t1 2  of 2 29×1015 years  and 150Nd  double beta decay  t1 2   7×1018 years  approximately   All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are shorter than eleven days  and the majority of these have half lives that are shorter than 70 seconds  Neodymium also has 13 known meta states  with the most stable one being 139mNd  t1 2   5 5 hours   135mNd  t1 2   5 5 minutes  and 133m1Nd  t1 2 ~70 seconds    The primary decay modes before the most abundant stable isotope  142Nd  are electron capture and positron decay  and the primary mode after is beta minus decay  The primary decay products before 142Nd are element Pr  praseodymium  isotopes and the primary products after are element Pm  promethium  isotopes   2  History  Neodymium was discovered by Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach  an Austrian chemist  in Vienna in 1885  He separated neodymium  as well as the element praseodymium  from a material known as didymium by means of fractional crystallization of the double ammonium nitrate tetrahydrates from nitric acid  while following the separation by spectroscopic analysis  however  it was not isolated in relatively pure form until 1925  The name neodymium is derived from the Greek words neos  νέος   new  and didymos  διδύμος   twin   Double nitrate crystallization was the means of commercial neodymium purification until the 1950s  Lindsay Chemical Division was the first to commercialize large scale ion exchange purification of neodymium  Starting in the 1950s  high purity  above 99%  neodymium was primarily obtained through an ion exchange process from monazite  a mineral rich in rare earth elements  The metal itself is obtained through electrolysis of its halide salts  Currently  most neodymium is extracted from bastnäsite   Ce La Nd Pr CO3F  and purified by solvent extraction  Ion exchange purification is reserved for preparing the highest purities  typically  99 99%   The evolving technology  and improved purity of commercially available neodymium oxide  was reflected in the appearance of neodymium glass that resides in collections today  Early neodymium glasses made in the 1930s have a more reddish or orange tinge than modern versions which are more cleanly purple  due to the difficulties in removing the last traces of praseodymium in the era when manufacturing relied upon fractional crystallization technology   3  Occurrence and production  Neodymium is never found in nature as the free element  but rather it occurs in ores such as monazite and bastnäsite that contain small amounts of all the rare earth metals  The main mining areas are in China  the United States  Brazil  India  Sri Lanka  and Australia  The reserves of neodymium are estimated at about eight million tonnes  Although it belongs to the rare earth metals  neodymium is not rare at all  Its abundance in the Earth crust is about 38 mg kg  which is the second highest among rare earth elements  following cerium  The world s production of neodymium was about 7 000 tonnes in 2004  The bulk of current production is from China  whose government has recently imposed strategic materials controls on the element  raising some concerns in consuming countries and causing skyrocketing prices of neodymium and other rare earth metals  As of late 2011  99% pure neodymium was traded in world markets for US$300–350 per kilogram  down from the mid 2011 peak of $500 kg   Neodymium is typically 10–18% of the rare earth content of commercial deposits of the light rare earth element minerals bastnasite and monazite  With neodymium compounds being the most strongly colored for the trivalent lanthanides  that percentage of neodymium can occasionally dominate the coloration of rare earth minerals—when competing chromophores are absent  It usually gives a pink coloration  Outstanding examples of this include monazite crystals from the tin deposits in Llallagua  Bolivia  ancylite from Mont Saint Hilaire  Quebec  Canada  or lanthanite from the Saucon Valley  Pennsylvania  US  As with neodymium glasses  such minerals change their colors under the differing lighting conditions  The absorption bands of neodymium interact with the visible emission spectrum of mercury vapor  with the unfiltered shortwave UV light causing neodymium containing minerals to reflect a distinctive green color  This can be observed with monazite containing sands or bastnasite containing ore   4  Applications  Neodymium has an unusually large specific heat capacity at liquid helium temperatures  so is useful in cryocoolers   Probably because of similarities to Ca2+  Nd3+ has been reported to promote plant growth  Rare earth element compounds are frequently used in China as fertilizer   Samarium neodymium dating is useful for determining the age relationships of rocks and meteorites   Size and strength of volcanic eruption can be predicted by scanning for neodymium isotopes  Small and large volcanic eruptions produce lava with different neodymium isotope composition  From the composition of isotopes  scientists predict how big the coming eruption will be  and use this information to warn residents of the intensity of the eruption   4 1  Magnets  Neodymium magnets  actually an alloy  Nd2Fe14B  are the strongest permanent magnets known  A neodymium magnet of a few grams can lift a thousand times its own weight  These magnets are cheaper  lighter  and stronger than samarium cobalt magnets  However  they are not superior in every aspect  as neodymium based magnets lose their magnetism at high temperatures and tend to rust  while samarium cobalt magnets do not   Neodymium magnets appear in products such as microphones  professional loudspeakers  in ear headphones  guitar and bass guitar pick ups  and computer hard disks where low mass  small volume  or strong magnetic fields are required  Neodymium magnet electric motors have also been responsible for the development of purely electrical model aircraft within the first decade of the 21st century  to the point that these are displacing internal combustion–powered models internationally  Likewise  due to this high magnetic capacity per weight  neodymium is used in the electric motors of hybrid and electric automobiles  and in the electricity generators of some designs of commercial wind turbines  only wind turbines with  permanent magnet  generators use neodymium   For example  drive electric motors of each Toyota Prius require one kilogram  2 2 pounds  of neodymium per vehicle   4 2  Neodymium doped lasers  Certain transparent materials with a small concentration of neodymium ions can be used in lasers as gain media for infrared wavelengths  1054–1064 nm   e g  Nd YAG  yttrium aluminium garnet   Nd YLF  yttrium lithium fluoride   Nd YVO4  yttrium orthovanadate   and Nd glass  Neodymium doped crystals  typically Nd YVO4  generate high powered infrared laser beams which are converted to green laser light in commercial DPSS hand held lasers and laser pointers   The current laser at the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment  AWE   the HELEN  High Energy Laser Embodying Neodymium  1 terawatt neodymium glass laser  can access the midpoints of pressure and temperature regions and is used to acquire data for modeling on how density  temperature  and pressure interact inside warheads  HELEN can create plasmas of around 106 K  from which opacity and transmission of radiation are measured   Neodymium glass solid state lasers are used in extremely high power  terawatt scale   high energy  megajoules  multiple beam systems for inertial confinement fusion  Nd glass lasers are usually frequency tripled to the third harmonic at 351 nm in laser fusion devices   4 3  Neodymium glass for other applications  Neodymium glass  Nd glass  is produced by the inclusion of neodymium oxide  Nd2O3  in the glass melt  Usually in daylight or incandescent light neodymium glass appears lavender  but it appears pale blue under fluorescent lighting  Neodymium may be used to color glass in delicate shades ranging from pure violet through wine red and warm gray   The first commercial use of purified neodymium was in glass coloration  starting with experiments by Leo Moser in November 1927  The resulting  Alexandrite  glass remains a signature color of the Moser glassworks to this day  Neodymium glass was widely emulated in the early 1930s by American glasshouses  most notably Heisey  Fostoria   wisteria    Cambridge   heatherbloom    and Steuben   wisteria    and elsewhere  e g  Lalique  in France  or Murano   Tiffin s  twilight  remained in production from about 1950 to 1980  Current sources include glassmakers in the Czech Republic  the United States  and China   The sharp absorption bands of neodymium cause the glass color to change under different lighting conditions  being reddish purple under daylight or yellow incandescent light  but blue under white fluorescent lighting  or greenish under trichromatic lighting  This color change phenomenon is highly prized by collectors  In combination with gold or selenium  beautiful red colors result  Since neodymium coloration depends upon  forbidden  f f transitions deep within the atom  there is relatively little influence on the color from the chemical environment  so the color is impervious to the thermal history of the glass  However  for the best color  iron containing impurities need to be minimized in the silica used to make the glass  The same forbidden nature of the f f transitions makes rare earth colorants less intense than those provided by most d transition elements  so more has to be used in a glass to achieve the desired color intensity  The original Moser recipe used about 5% of neodymium oxide in the glass melt  a sufficient quantity such that Moser referred to these as being  rare earth doped  glasses  Being a strong base  that level of neodymium would have affected the melting properties of the glass  and the lime content of the glass might have had to be adjusted accordingly   Light transmitted through neodymium glasses shows unusually sharp absorption bands  the glass is used in astronomical work to produce sharp bands by which spectral lines may be calibrated  Neodymium is also used to remove the green color caused by iron contaminants from glass  Neodymium is a component of  didymium   referring to mixture of salts of neodymium and praseodymium  used for coloring glass to make welder s and glass blower s goggles  the sharp absorption bands obliterate the strong sodium emission at 589 nm   Neodymium and didymium glass are used in color enhancing filters in indoor photography  particularly in filtering out the yellow hues from incandescent lighting   Similarly  neodymium glass is becoming widely used more directly in incandescent light bulbs  These lamps contain neodymium in the glass to filter out yellow light  resulting in a whiter light which is more like sunlight   Neodymium has been patented for use in automobile rear view mirrors  to reduce the glare at night   Similar to its use in glasses  neodymium salts are used as a colorant for enamels   5  Precautions  Neodymium metal dust is a combustion and explosion hazard  Neodymium compounds  as with all rare earth metals  are of low to moderate toxicity  however its toxicity has not been thoroughly investigated  Neodymium dust and salts are very irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes  and moderately irritating to skin  Breathing the dust can cause lung embolisms  and accumulated exposure damages the liver  Neodymium also acts as an anticoagulant  especially when given intravenously   Neodymium magnets have been tested for medical uses such as magnetic braces and bone repair  but biocompatibility issues have prevented widespread application  Commercially available magnets made from neodymium are exceptionally strong  and can attract each other from large distances  If not handled carefully  they come together very quickly and forcefully  causing injuries  For example  there is at least one documented case of a person losing a fingertip when two magnets he was using snapped together from 50 cm away   Another risk of these powerful magnets is that if more than one magnet is ingested  they can pinch soft tissues in the gastrointestinal tract  This has led to at least 1 700 emergency room visits and necessitated the recall of the Buckyballs line of toys  which were construction sets of small neodymium magnets   6  References  7  Books  The Industrial Chemistry of the Lanthanons  Yttrium  Thorium and Uranium  by R  J  Callow
