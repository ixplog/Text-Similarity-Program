represents the highpoint of the Fujiwara clan s control over the government of Japan   1  Early life  He was the fourth or fifth son of Fujiwara no Kaneie by his wife Tokihime  daughter of Fujiwara no Nakamasa  There were two regents and two imperial consorts among his brothers and sisters by the same mother   As the youngest son of his father  he was not remarkable in the court until his two brothers died  He started his career in the court when he was 15 years old   986  Kanna 2   Sakyō no Daibu  左京大夫   986  Eien 2  29th day of the 1st month    Gon no Chūnagon  権中納言   991  Shōryaku 2  7th day of the 9th month   Gon no Dainagon  権大納言  In 995 during the reign of Emperor Ichijō  his two elder brothers Michitaka and Michikane died of disease  He struggled with Fujiwara no Korechika  the elder son of Michitaka  for political power  With support of Senshi  his sister and mother of Ichijō  Michinaga succeeded in gaining power as well the support of majority of the court  He was appointed Nairan  the secretary of the emperor and the reviewer of all the documents sent to the emperor before the emperor himself read them   995  Chōtoku 1  11th day of the 5th month   Nairan  内覧   2  Career  Michinaga exerted de facto reign over Japan in the early 11th century  This can be seen from the fact that he was father to four  non reigning  empresses  uncle to two emperors and grandfather to another three   995  Chōtoku 1  19th day of the 6th month   Udaijin  右大臣   996  Chōtoku 2  20th day of the 7th month   Sadaijin  左大臣  Though Ichijō already had an empress  a daughter of Michitaka  he claimed there were two types of empresshood and therefore it was legal for an emperor to have two empresses at the same time  Michinaga s ambitions led him to make his own daughter  Shōshi  a second empress of Ichijō  In 1000 Shōshi was announced as a Chūgū empress and the existing empress Teishi was given the title of Kōgō empress  It was the first time an emperor had two empresses  A power struggle between Korechika and Michinaga continued until Teishi s unexpected death in 1001  which sealed Michinaga s power since Shōshi became the only empress after Teishi s death   In 1006  Michinaga invited Murasaki Shikibu to become Empress Shōshi’s companion and tutor    Shōshi was the mother of two princes who became emperors  Emperor Go Ichijō and Emperor Go Suzaku  Michinaga s other daughters  Kenshi and Ishi  followed similar fates to Shōshi and further ensured Michinaga s power over the court   1011  Kankō 8  13th day of the 6th month   In the 25th year of Emperor Ichijō s reign  一条天皇25年   the emperor abdicated  and the succession  ‘‘senso’’  was received by his cousin  Shortly thereafter  Emperor Sanjō is said to have acceded to the throne  ‘‘sokui’’   After Ichijō retired because of illness  Emperor Sanjō ascended the throne  Though Sanjō was a nephew of Michinaga  the mother of Sanjō was another sister of Michinaga  she had died already in Sanjō s childhood and he was relatively less influenced by his maternal line    1011  Kankō 8   Michinaga is Sesshō  1011  Kankō 8  23rd day of the 8th month   Fujiwara Michinaga is granted the extraordinary privilege of travelling to and from the court by ox drawn cart  Michinaga and Sanjō s opinions often varied  Michinaga pressured Sanjō to retire and finally Sanjō did so in 1016 under a condition made upon Sanjō s succession  Sanjō s elder son was appointed as Go Ichijō s successor   1011  Kankō 8   Prince Atsunari  the second son of former Emperor Ichijo  is proclaimed Crown Prince  Sanjō s eldest son  Prince Atsuakira  had been the officially designated heir  but pressure from Michinaga forced the young prince to abandon his position  Michinaga s political power and influence led to the crown prince s resignation by his will  Michinaga was pleased by this decision and gave his daughter  either Kenshi or Ishi  to this prince as a wife  ensuring that the prince would not be an obstacle in the future   1012  Chōwa 1  8th month   Emperor Sanjō marries a daughter of Sesshō and later Kampaku Fujiwara no Michinaga  During the initial years of Go Ichijō s reign  Fujiwara no Michinaga actually ruled from his position as sesshō  regent   Although Michinaga never formally took on the title of kampaku regent  he exercised great power and influence   1013  Chōwa 2  9th month   Sanjō visits the home of Michinaga   1013  Chōwa 3  5th month   Sanjō visited the home of Michinaga where he enjoyed himself with horse riding and archery   1015  Chōwa 4  10th month   Michinaga s 50th birthday is celebrated   1016  Chōwa 5  29th day of the 1st month   Michinaga is Sesshō for Emperor Go Ichijō  1017  Chōwa 6  16th day of the 3rd month   retired from Sesshō  1017  Kannin 1  8th month   Prince Atsuakira  the eldest son of Emperor Sanjo  had been named Crown Prince  but after he is struck by a skin disease and under intense pressure from Michinaga  he withdraws from this role and his younger brother  Prince Atsunaga  is named Crown Prince in his place   1017  Kannin 1  9th month   Michinaga made a pilgrimage to the Iwashimizu Shrine accompanied by many courtiers  The travelers divided themselves amongst 15 boats for a floating trip down the Yotogawa River  One of the vessels overturned  and more than 30 people lost their lives   1017  Kannin 1  4th day of the 12th month   Michinaga was elevated to the office of Daijō Daijin   1018  Kannin 2  9th day of the 2nd month   retires from Daijō Daijin  1019  Kannin 3  21st day of the 3rd month   Becomes a priest   3  Later years  Michinaga exercised such powers even after he formally retired from public life in 1019  He continued to direct the affairs of his son and successor  Fujiwara no Yorimichi   Michinaga is popularly known as the Mido Kampaku  implying that he had usurped the full power of a kampaku without necessarily calling himself that  though he retained the title sesshō regent in a short term from 1016 till 1017  In 1017  he gave this office to his heir Yorimichi  Soon afterwards  a series of emperors started to retire to a monastery early in life  and put their young sons on the throne to run the country from behind the scenes  As it turned out  this tactic briefly allowed the emperors to wrestle power back from the Fujiwara clan  only to see it fall to the Taira warrior clan instead   4  Death  January 3  1028  Manju 4  4th day of the 12th month   Michinaga died at the age of 62   4 1  Legacy  Michinaga left a diary  Mido Kanpakuki  御堂関白記   that is one of our prime sources of information about Heian era court life at its height   4 2  Self evaluation   This world  I think  Is indeed my world  Like the full moon I shine  Uncovered by any cloud   This poem is known as
