Links is an open source text and graphic web browser with a pull down menu system  It renders complex pages  has partial HTML 4 0 support  including tables and frames and support for multiple character sets such as UTF 8   supports color and monochrome terminals and allows horizontal scrolling   It is oriented toward users who want to retain many typical elements of graphical user interfaces  pop up windows  menus etc   in a text only environment   The original version of Links was developed by Mikulas Patocka in the Czech Republic  His group  Twibright Labs  later developed version 2 of the Links browser  that displays graphics  renders fonts in different sizes  with spatial anti aliasing  and supports JavaScript  up to version 2 1pre28   The resulting browser is very fast  but it does not display many pages as they were intended  The graphical mode works even on Unix systems without X or any other window environment  using either SVGALib or the framebuffer of the system s graphics card   1  Graphics stack  The graphics stack has several peculiarities unusual for a web browser  The fonts displayed by Links are not derived from the system  but compiled into the binary as grayscale bitmaps in PNG format  This allows the browser to be a single executable file independent of the system libraries  however it increases the size of the executable to about 5 MB   The fonts are anti aliased without hinting and for small line pitch an artificial sharpening is employed to increase legibility  Subpixel sampling further increases legibility on LCD displays  This allowed Links to have anti aliased fonts at a time when anti aliased font libraries were uncommon   All graphical elements  images and text  are first converted from given gamma space  according to known or assumed gamma information in PNG  JPEG etc   through known user gamma setting into a 48 bits per pixel photometrically linear space where they are resampled with bilinear resampling to the target size  possibly taking aspect ratio correction into account  Then the data are passed through high performance restartable dithering engine which is used regardless of monitor bit depth  i  e  also for 24 bits per pixel colour  This Floyd Steinberg dithering engine takes into account the gamma characteristics of the monitor and uses 768 KiB of dithering tables to avoid time expensive calculations  A technique similar to self modifying code  function templates  is used to maximize the speed of the dithering engine without using assembler optimization  which is non portable   Images which are scaled down also use subpixel sampling on LCD to increase level of detail   The reason for this high quality processing is  provide proper realistic up downsampling of images  and photorealistic display regardless of the monitor gamma  without colour fringing caused by 8 bit gamma correction built into the X server  It also increases the perceived colour depth over 24 bits per pixel   Despite the amount of digital image processing that has to be internally done  Links is one of the fastest graphical web browsers   Links has graphics drivers for the X Server  Linux framebuffer  svgalib  OS 2 PMShell and AtheOS GUI  This allows it to run in graphics mode even on platforms which don t have X Server   2  Forks  2 1  ELinks  ELinks   Experimental Enhanced Links   is a fork of Links led by Petr Baudis  It is based on Links 0 9  It has a more open development and incorporates patches from other Links versions  such as additional extension scripting in Lua  and from Internet users   2 2  Hacked Links  Hacked Links is another version of the Links browser which has merged some of Elinks  features into Links 2   Andrey Mirtchovski has ported it to Plan 9  It is considered a good browser on that operating system  though some users have complained about its inability to cut and paste with the Plan 9 snarf buffer   the last release of Hacked Links is that of July 9  2003 with some further changes unreleased   2 3  Other  Links was also ported to run on the Sony PSP platform by Rafael Cabezas with the last version  2 1pre23 PSP r1261  released on February 6  2007   The BeOS port was updated by Franc ois Revol who also added GUI support  It also runs on Haiku   3  References  4  External links  at Twibright Labs  Links for Mac OS X on and
