Parmenides of Elea      fl  late sixth or early fifth century BCE  was a pre Socratic Greek philosopher from Elea in Magna Graecia  He was the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy  The single known work of Parmenides is a poem  On Nature  which has survived only in fragmentary form  In this poem  Parmenides describes two views of reality  In  the way of truth   a part of the poem   he explains how reality  coined as  what is   is one  change is impossible  and existence is timeless  uniform  necessary  and unchanging  In  the way of opinion   he explains the world of appearances  in which one s sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful  These ideas had a strong effect on Plato  and in turn  influenced the whole of Western philosophy   1  Life  Parmenides was born in the Greek colony of Elea  now Ascea   which  according to Herodotus  had been founded shortly before 535 BCE  He was descended from a wealthy and illustrious family  His dates are uncertain  according to Diogenes Laërtius  he flourished just before 500 BCE  which would put his year of birth near 540 BCE  but Plato has him visiting Athens at the age of 65  when Socrates was a young man  c  450 BCE  which  if true  suggests a year of birth of c  515 BCE  He was said to have been a pupil of Xenophanes  and regardless of whether they actually knew each other  Xenophanes  philosophy is the most obvious influence on Parmenides  Diogenes Laërtius also describes Parmenides as a disciple of  Ameinias  son of Diochaites  the Pythagorean   but there are no obvious Pythagorean elements in his thought  The first hero cult of a philosopher we know of was Parmenides  dedication of a heroon to his teacher Ameinias in Elea  Parmenides was the founder of the School of Elea  which also included Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos  Of his life in Elea  it was said that he had written the laws of the city  His most important pupil was Zeno  who according to Plato was twenty five years his junior  and was regarded as his eromenos  Parmenides had a large influence on Plato  who not only named a dialogue  Parmenides  after him  but always spoke of him with veneration   2  On Nature  Parmenides is one of the most significant of the pre Socratic philosophers  His only known work  conventionally titled On Nature  is a poem which has only survived in fragmentary form  Approximately 160 lines of the poem remain today  reportedly the original text had 3 000 lines  It is known  however  that the work was originally divided into three parts   A proem  Greek  προοίμιον   which introduced the entire work   A section known as  The Way of Truth   aletheia  ἀλήθεια   and  A section known as  The Way of Appearance Opinion   doxa  δόξα   The proem is a narrative sequence in which the narrator travels  beyond the beaten paths of mortal men  to receive a revelation from an unnamed goddess  generally thought to be Persephone or Dike  on the nature of reality  Aletheia  an estimated 90% of which has survived  and doxa  most of which no longer exists  are then presented as the spoken revelation of the goddess without any accompanying narrative   Parmenides attempted to distinguish between the unity of nature and its variety  insisting in the Way of Truth upon the reality of its unity  which is therefore the object of knowledge  and upon the unreality of its variety  which is therefore the object  not of knowledge  but of opinion  In the Way of Opinion he propounded a theory of the world of seeming and its development  pointing out  however  that  in accordance with the principles already laid down  these cosmological speculations do not pretend to anything more than mere appearance   2 1  Proem  In the proem  Parmenides describes the journey of a young man from light to the  halls of Night    the daughters of the Sun made haste to escort me  having left the halls of Night for the light    Carried in a whirling chariot  and attended by the daughters of the Sun  the man reaches a temple sacred to an unnamed goddess  variously identified by the commentators as Nature  Wisdom  or Themis   by whom the rest of the poem is spoken  He must learn all things  she tells him—both truth  which is certain  and human opinions  which are uncertain—for though one cannot rely on human opinions  they represent an aspect of the whole truth   2 2  The Way of Truth  The section known as  the way of truth  discusses that which is real and contrasts with the argument in the section called  the way of opinion   which discusses that which is illusory  Under the  way of truth   Parmenides stated that there are two ways of inquiry  that it is  on the one side  and that it is not  on the other side  He said that the latter argument is never feasible because nothing can not be   There are extremely delicate issues here  In the original Greek the two ways are simply named  that Is   ὅπως ἐστίν  and  that Not Is   ὡς οὐκ ἐστίν   B 2 3 and 2 5  without the  it  inserted in our English translation  In ancient Greek  which  like many languages in the world  does not always require the presence of a subject for a verb   is  functions as a grammatically complete sentence  Much debate has been focused on where and what the subject is  The simplest explanation as to why there is no subject here is that Parmenides wishes to express the simple  bare fact of existence in his mystical experience without the ordinary distinctions  just as the Latin  pluit  and the Greek huei  ὕει  rains   mean  it rains   there is no subject for these impersonal verbs because they express the simple fact of raining without specifying what is doing the raining  This is  for instance  Hermann Fränkel s thesis  Many scholars still reject this explanation and have produced more complex metaphysical explanations  Since existence is an immediately intuited fact  non existence is the wrong path because a thing cannot disappear  just as something cannot originate from nothing  In such mystical experience  unio mystica   however  the distinction between subject and object disappears along with the distinctions between objects  in addition to the fact that if nothing cannot be  it cannot be the object of thought either   Thus  he concluded that  Is  could not have  come into being  because  nothing comes from nothing   Existence is necessarily eternal  That which truly is  x   has always been  x   and was never becoming  x   that which is becoming  x  was never nothing  Not  x    but will never actually be  Parmenides was not struggling to formulate the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy  he was struggling with the metaphysics of change  which is still a relevant philosophical topic today   Moreover he argued that movement was impossible because it requires moving into  the void   and Parmenides identified  the void  with nothing  and therefore  by definition  it does not exist  That which does exist is The Parmenidean One  which is timeless  uniform  and unchanging   2 2 1  Perception vs  Logos  Parmenides claimed that there is no truth in the opinions of the mortals  Genesis and destruction  as Parmenides emphasizes  is a false opinion  because to be means to be completely  once and for all  What exists can in no way not exist   2 3  The Way of Opinion  doxa   After the exposition of the arche  ἀρχή   i e  the origin  the necessary part of reality that is understood through reason or logos  that  it  Is   in the next section  the Way of Appearance Opinion Seeming  Parmenides proceeds to explain the structure of the becoming cosmos  which is an illusion  of course  that comes from this origin   The structure of the cosmos is a fundamental binary principle that governs the manifestations of all the particulars   the aether fire of flame   B 8 56   which is gentle  mild  soft  thin and clear  and self identical  and the other is  ignorant night   body thick and heavy   The structure of the cosmos then generated is recollected by Aetius  II  7  1    For Parmenides says that there are circular bands wound round one upon the other  one made of the rare  the other of the dense  and others between these mixed of light and darkness  What surrounds them all is solid like a wall  Beneath it is a fiery band  and what is in the very middle of them all is solid  around which again is a fiery band  The most central of the mixed bands is for them all the origin and cause of motion and becoming  which he also calls steering goddess and keyholder and Justice and Necessity  The air has been separated off from the earth  vapourized by its more violent condensation  and the sun and the circle of the Milky Way are exhalations of fire  The moon is a mixture of both earth and fire  The aether lies around above all else  and beneath it is ranged that fiery part which we call heaven  beneath which are the regions around the earth   3  Interpretations of Parmenides  The traditional interpretation of Parmenides  work is that he argued that the every day perception of reality of the physical world  as described in doxa  is mistaken  and that the reality of the world is  One Being   as described in aletheia   an unchanging  ungenerated  indestructible whole  Under the Way of Opinion  Parmenides set out a contrasting but more conventional view of the world  thereby becoming an early exponent of the duality of appearance and reality  For him and his pupils  the phenomena of movement and change are simply appearances of a changeless  eternal reality  This interpretation could settle because of various wrong translations of the fragments  For example  it is not at all clear that Parmenides refuted that which we call perception  The verb noein  used frequently by Parmenides  could better be translated as  to be aware of  than as  to think   Furthermore  it is hard to believe that  being  is only within our heads  according to Parmenides   Parmenides  philosophy is presented in the form of poetry  The philosophy he argued was  he says  given to him by a goddess  though the  mythological  details in Parmenides  poem do not bear any close correspondence to anything known from traditional Greek mythology   It is with respect to this religious mystical context that recent generations of scholars such as Alexander P  Mourelatos  Charles H  Kahn  and the controversial Peter Kingsley have begun to call parts of the traditional  rational logical philosophical interpretation of Parmenides into question  Kingsley in particular stating that Parmenides practiced iatromancy   It has been claimed that previous scholars placed too little emphasis on the apocalyptic context in which Parmenides frames his revelation  As a result  traditional interpretations have put Parmenidean philosophy into a more modern  metaphysical context to which it is not necessarily well suited  which has led to misunderstanding of the true meaning and intention of Parmenides  message  The obscurity and fragmentary state of the text  however  renders almost every claim that can be made about Parmenides extremely contentious  and the traditional interpretation has by no means been abandoned   Parmenides  considerable influence on the thinking of Plato is undeniable  and in this respect Parmenides has influenced the whole history of Western philosophy  and is often seen as its grandfather  Even Plato himself  in the Sophist  refers to the work of  our Father Parmenides  as something to be taken very seriously and treated with respect  In the Parmenides  the Eleatic philosopher  which may well be Parmenides himself  and Socrates argue about dialectic  In the Theaetetus  Socrates says that Parmenides alone among the wise  Protagoras  Heraclitus  Empedocles  Epicharmus  and Homer  denied that everything is change and motion   Parmenides is credited with a great deal of influence as the author of an  Eleatic challenge  that determined the course of subsequent philosophers  enquiries  For example  the ideas of Empedocles  Anaxagoras  Leucippus  and Democritus have been seen as in response to Parmenides  arguments and conclusions   Parmenides  influence on philosophy reaches up till present times  The Italian philosopher Emanuele Severino has founded his extended philosophical investigations on the words of Parmenides  His philosophy is sometimes called Neo Parmenideism  and can be understood as an attempt to build a bridge between the poem on truth and the poem on opinion   4  Influence on the development of science  Parmenides made the ontological argument against nothingness  essentially denying the possible existence of a void  According to Aristotle  this led Democritus and Leucippus  and many other physicists  to propose the atomic theory  which supposes that everything in the universe is either atoms or voids  specifically to contradict Parmenides  argument  Aristotle himself reasoned  in opposition to atomism  that in a complete vacuum  motion would encounter no resistance  and  no one could say why a thing once set in motion should stop anywhere  for why should it stop here rather than here  So that a thing will either be at rest or must be moved ad infinitum  unless something more powerful get in its way   See also horror vacui   Erwin Schrödinger identified Parmenides  monad of the  Way of Truth  as being the conscious self in  Nature and the Greeks   The scientific implications of this view have been discussed by scientist Anthony Hyman   A shadow of Parmenides  ideas can be seen in the physical concept of Block time  which considers existence to consist of past  present  and future  and the flow of time to be illusory  In his critique of this idea  Karl Popper called Einstein  Parmenides   However  Popper did write   So what was really new in Parmenides was his axiomatic deductive method  which Leucippus and Democritus turned into a hypothetical deductive method  and thus made part of scientific methodology   5  Notes  6  References and further reading  Austin  Scott  2007   Parmenides and the History of
