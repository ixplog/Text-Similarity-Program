A musical ensemble  also known as a music group  is a group of people who perform instrumental or vocal music  typically known by a distinct name  In classical music  trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families  such as piano  strings  and wind instruments  or group together instruments from the same instrument family  such as string ensembles or wind ensembles  In jazz ensembles  the instruments typically include wind instruments  one or more saxophones  trumpets  etc    one or two chordal  comping  instruments  electric guitar  piano  or organ   a bass instrument  bass guitar or double bass   and a drummer or percussionist  In rock ensembles  usually called rock bands  there are usually guitars and keyboards  piano  electric piano  Hammond organ  synthesizer  etc   and a rhythm section made up of a bass guitar and drum kit   1  Classical chamber music  In Western classical music  smaller ensembles are called chamber music ensembles  The terms duet  trio  quartet  quintet  sextet  septet  octet  nonet and dectet describe groups of two up to ten musicians  respectively  A group of eleven musicians  such as found in The Carnival of the Animals  is called either a hendectet or an undectet  see Latin numerical prefixes   A solo is not an ensemble because it only contains one musician   1 1  Four parts  1 1 1  Strings  A string quartet usually consists of two violins  a viola and a cello  An upper string quartet features two violins and two violas  A lower string quartet features one viola  two cellos and a double bass   1 1 2  Wind  A woodwind quartet usually features a flute  an oboe  a clarinet and a bassoon  A brass quartet features two trumpets  a trombone and a tuba  A wind quartet features a horn  a flute  an oboe and a bassoon  A lower wind quartet features a tuba  a bassoon  a bass clarinet and a trombone  A saxophone quartet consists of a soprano saxophone  an alto saxophone  a tenor saxophone  and a baritone saxophone   1 2  Five parts  The string quintet is a common type of group  It is similar to the string quartet  but with an additional viola  cello  or more rarely  the addition of a double bass  Terms such as  piano quintet  or  clarinet quintet  frequently refer to a string quartet plus a fifth instrument  Mozart s Clarinet Quintet is similarly a piece written for an ensemble consisting of two violins  a viola  a cello and a clarinet  the last being the exceptional addition to a  normal  string quartet   Some other quintets in classical music are the woodwind quintet  usually consisting of flute  oboe  clarinet  bassoon and horn  the brass quintet  consisting of two trumpets  one french horn  a trombone and a tuba  and the reed quintet  consisting of an oboe  a soprano clarinet  a saxophone  a bass clarinet  and a bassoon   1 3  Six or more instruments  Classical chamber ensembles of six  sextet   seven  septet   or eight musicians  octet  are fairly common  use of latinate terms for larger groups is rare  In most cases a larger classical group is referred to as an orchestra of some type or a concert band  A small orchestra with fifteen to thirty members  violins  violas  four cellos  two or three double basses  and several woodwind or brass instruments  is called a chamber orchestra  A sinfonietta usually denotes a somewhat smaller orchestra  though still not a chamber orchestra   Larger orchestras are called symphony orchestras  see below  or philharmonic orchestras   A pops orchestra is an orchestra that mainly performs light classical music  often in abbreviated  simplified arrangements  and orchestral arrangements and medleys of popular jazz  music theater  or pop music songs  A string orchestra has only string instruments  i e   violins  violas  cellos and double basses   A symphony orchestra is an ensemble usually comprising at least thirty musicians  the number of players is typically between fifty and ninety five and may exceed one hundred  A symphony orchestra is divided into families of instruments  In the string family  there are sections of violins  I and II   violas  cellos  often eight   and basses  often from six to eight   The standard woodwind section consists of flutes  one doubling piccolo   oboes  one doubling English horn   soprano clarinets  one doubling bass clarinet   and bassoons  one doubling contrabassoon   The standard brass section consists of French horns  trumpets  trombones  and tuba  The percussion section includes the timpani  bass drum  snare drum  and any other percussion instruments called for in a score  e g   triangle  glockenspiel  chimes  cymbals  wood blocks  etc     A concert band is a large classical ensemble generally made up of between 40 and 70 musicians from the woodwind  brass  and percussion families  along with the double bass  The concert band has a larger variety of wind instruments and a larger amount of wind instruments than the symphony orchestra  but the concert band does not have a string section  although a single double bass is common in concert bands   The woodwind section of a concert band consists of piccolo  flutes  oboes  one doubling English horn   bassoons  one doubling contrabassoon   soprano clarinets  one doubling Eb clarinet  one doubling alto clarinet   bass clarinets  one doubling contrabass clarinet or contra alto clarinet   alto saxophones  one doubling soprano saxophone   tenor saxophone  and baritone saxophone  The brass section consists of French horns  trumpets and or cornets  trombones  euphoniums  and tubas  The percussion section consists of the timpani  bass drum  snare drum  and any other percussion instruments called for in a score  e g   triangle  glockenspiel  chimes  cymbals  wood blocks  etc     When orchestras are performing baroque music  from the 17th century and early 18th century   they may also use a harpsichord or pipe organ  playing the continuo part  When orchestras are performing Romantic era music  from the 19th century   they may also use harps or unusual instruments such as the wind machine  When orchestras are performing music from the 20th century or the 21st century  occasionally instruments such as electric guitar  theremin  or even an electronic synthesizer may be used   2  Jazz ensembles  2 1  Three parts  In jazz  there are several types of trios  One type of jazz trio is formed with a piano player  a bass player and a drummer  Another type of jazz trio that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s is the organ trio  which is composed of a Hammond organ player  a drummer  and a third instrumentalist  either a saxophone player or an electric jazz guitarist   In organ trios  the Hammond organ player performs the bass line on the organ bass pedals while simultaneously playing chords or lead lines on the keyboard manuals  Other types of trios include the  drummer less  trio  which consists of a piano player  a double bassist  and a horn  saxophone or trumpet  or guitar player  and the jazz trio with a horn player  saxophone or trumpet   double bass player  and a drummer  In the latter type of trio  the lack of a chordal instrument means that the horn player and the bassist have to imply the changing harmonies with their improvised lines   2 2  Four parts  Jazz quartets typically add a horn  the generic jazz name for saxophones  trombones  trumpets  or any other wind or brass instrument commonly associated with jazz  to one of the jazz trios described above  Slightly larger jazz ensembles  such as quintets  five instruments  or sextets  six instruments  typically add other soloing instruments to the basic quartet formation  such as different types of saxophones  e g   alto saxophone  tenor saxophone  etc   or an additional chordal instrument   2 3  Larger ensembles  The lineup of larger jazz ensembles can vary considerably  depending on the style of jazz being performed  In a 1920s style dixieland jazz band  a larger ensemble would be formed by adding a banjo player  woodwind instruments  as with the clarinet  or additional horns  saxophones  trumpets  trombones  to one of the smaller groups  In a 1940s style Swing big band  a larger ensemble is formed by adding  sections  of like instruments  such as a saxophone section and a trumpet section  which perform arranged  horn lines  to accompany the ensemble  In a 1970s style jazz fusion ensemble  a larger ensemble is often formed by adding additional percussionists or sometimes a saxophone player would  double  or  triple  meaning that they would also be proficient at the clarinet  flute or both  Also by the addition of soloing instruments   3  Rock and pop bands  3 1  Two parts  Two member rock and pop bands are relatively rare  because of the difficulty in providing all of the musical elements which are part of the rock or pop sound  vocals  chords  bass lines  and percussion or drumming   Two member rock and pop bands typically omit one of these musical elements  In many cases  two member bands will omit a drummer  since guitars  bass guitars  and keyboards can all be used to provide a rhythmic pulse   Examples of two member bands are Japandroids  Ween  until 1994   The Lightning Strikers  Local H  Pet Shop Boys  Hella  Flight of the Conchords  Death from Above 1979  Francis Xavier  I Set My Friends On Fire  Middle Class Rut  The Pity Party  Little Fish  The White Stripes  Big Business  Two Gallants  Lightning Bolt  The Ting Tings  The Black Box Revelation  Satyricon  The Black Keys  Tenacious D  They Might Be Giants  until 1992   Simon and Garfunkel  Hall & Oates  Johnossi  The Pack A D  and Royal Blood   When electronic sequencers became widely available in the 1980s  this made it easier for two member bands to add in musical elements that the two band members were not able to perform  Sequencers allowed bands to pre program some elements of their performance  such as an electronic drum part and a synth bass line  Two member pop music bands such as Soft Cell  Blancmange and Yazoo used pre programmed sequencers  Other pop bands from the 1980s which were ostensibly fronted by two performers  such as Wham   Eurythmics and Tears for Fears  were not actually two piece ensembles  because other instrumental musicians were used  behind the scenes  to fill out the sound   Two piece bands in rock music are quite rare  However  starting in the 2000s  blues influenced rock bands such as The White Stripes and The Black Keys utilized a guitar and drums scheme  However  this is predated by the Flat Duo Jets from the 1980s  Death from Above 1979 featured a drummer and bass guitarist  Tenacious D is a two guitar band  One Day as a Lion and The Dresden Dolls both feature a keyboardist and a drummer  The band Welk consists of a two man psychedelic flute band  with the occasional synthesizer  Two person bands have grown in popularity in experimental rock music   W A S P  guitarist Doug Blair is also known for his work in the two piece progressive rock band signal2noise  where he acts as the lead guitarist and bassist at the same time  thanks to a special custom instrument he invented  an electric guitar with five regular guitar strings paired with three bass guitar strings   Heisenflei of Los Angeles duo The Pity Party plays drums  keyboards  and sings simultaneously  Providence based Lightning Bolt is a two member band  Bassist Brian Gibson augments his playing with delay pedals  pitch shifters  looping devices and other pedals  occasionally creating harmony  Local H  Blood Red Shoes  PS I Love You  The Redmond Barry s and Warship are other prominent two person experimental rock bands   3 2  Three parts  The smallest ensemble that is commonly used in rock music is the trio format  In a hard rock or blues rock band  or heavy metal rock group  a  power trio  format is often used  which consists of an electric guitar player  an electric bass guitar player and a drummer  and typically one or more of these musicians also sing  sometimes all three members will sing  e g  Bee Gees or Alkaline Trio   Some well known power trios with the guitarist on lead vocals are The Jimi Hendrix Experience  Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble  Nirvana  Violent Femmes  Gov t Mule  The Minutemen  Triumph  Shellac  Sublime  Chevelle  Muse  The Jam  Short Stack  ZZ Top  and Agnes Strange   A handful of others with the bassist on vocals include Primus  Motörhead  The Police  The Melvins  Blue Cheer  Rush  The Presidents of the United States of America  Venom  and Cream   Some power trios feature two lead vocalists  both of which play their respective instruments  For example  in the band blink 182 vocals are split between bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge  or in the band Dinosaur Jr   guitarist J  Mascis is the primary songwriter and vocalist  but bassist Lou Barlow writes some songs and sings as well   An alternative to the power trio are organ trios formed with an electric guitarist  a drummer and a keyboardist  Although organ trios are most commonly associated with 1950s and 1960s jazz organ trio groups such as those led by organist Jimmy Smith  there are also organ trios in rock oriented styles  such as jazz rock fusion and Grateful Dead influenced jam bands such as Medeski Martin & Wood  In organ trios  the keyboard player typically plays a Hammond organ or similar instrument  which permits the keyboard player to perform bass lines  chords  and lead lines  one example being hard rock band Zebra  A variant of the organ trio are trios formed with an electric bassist  a drummer and an electronic keyboardist  playing synthesizers  such as the progressive rock band Emerson  Lake & Palmer  and Atomic Rooster  Another variation is to have a vocalist  a guitarist and a drummer  an example being Yeah Yeah Yeahs  Another variation is two guitars  a bassist  and a drum machine  examples including Magic Wands and Big Black   A power trio with the guitarist on lead vocals is a popular record company lineup  as the guitarist and singer will usually be the songwriter  Therefore you only have to present one face to the public  the backing band is easy to house  and the songs will likely stay simple and accessible as the frontman will have to sing and play guitar at the same time   3 3  Four parts  The four piece band is the most common configuration in rock and pop music  Before the development of the electronic keyboard  the configuration was typically two guitarists  a lead guitarist and a rhythm guitarist  with one of them singing lead vocals   a bassist  and a drummer  e g  The Beatles  KISS  Jackyl  Foo Fighters  Metallica  The Clash  Creedence Clearwater Revival  The Kinks  The Fray  Sonic Youth  The Smashing Pumpkins  Arctic Monkeys  Franz Ferdinand   This is popular with bands for its versatility   Another common formation was a vocalist  electric guitarist  bass guitarist  and a drummer  e g The Who  Led Zeppelin  Queen  The Ramones  Sex Pistols  Red Hot Chili Peppers  R E M   Blur  The Smiths  Echo and the Bunnymen  The Stone Roses  Creed  Black Sabbath  Van Halen  Rage Against the Machine  Gym Class Heroes  The Stooges  Joy Division  and U2   Instrumentally  these bands can be considered as trios  This format is popular with new bands  as there are only two instruments that need tuning  the melody and chords formula prevalent with their material is easy to learn  four members are commonplace to work with  the roles are clearly defined and generally are  instrumental melody line  rhythm section which plays the chords and or countermelody  and vocals on top   In some early rock bands  keyboardists were used  performing on piano  e g  The Seeds and The Doors  with a guitarist  singer  drummer and keyboardist  Some bands will have a guitarist  bassist  drummer  and keyboard player  for example  Talking Heads  Gerry and the Pacemakers  Small Faces  King Crimson  The Guess Who  Pink Floyd  Queen  Coldplay  The Killers  The Monkees and Blind Faith    Some bands will have the bassist on lead vocals  such as Thin Lizzy  The Chameleons  Skillet  Pink Floyd  Motörhead  NOFX  +44  Slayer  The All American Rejects or even the lead guitarist  such as Dire Straits  Megadeth and Creedence Clearwater Revival  Some bands  such as The Beatles  have a lead guitarist  a rhythm guitarist and a bassist that all sing lead and backing vocals  that also play keyboards regularly  as well as a drummer  Others  such as The Four Seasons  have a lead vocalist  a lead guitarist  a keyboard player  and a bassist  with the drummer not being a member of the band   3 4  Five parts  Five piece bands have existed in rock music since early times  The Beach Boys  The Rolling Stones  Aerosmith  Def Leppard  AC DC  Oasis  Pearl Jam  Guns N  Roses  Radiohead  The Strokes  Styx  The Yardbirds  311 and The Hives are examples of the common vocalist  lead guitar  rhythm guitar  bass  and drums lineup  An alternative to the five member lineup replaces the rhythm guitarist with a keyboard–synthesizer player  examples being the bands Journey  Elbow  Dream Theater  Genesis  Jethro Tull  Kasabian  The Zombies  The Animals  Bon Jovi  Yes  Snow Patrol  Fleetwood Mac  Marilyn Manson and Deep Purple  all of which consist of a vocalist  guitarist  bassist  keyboardist  and a drummer  or with a turntablist such as Deftones  Hed PE  Incubus or Limp Bizkit   Alternatives include a keyboardist  guitarist  drummer  bassist  and saxophonist  such as The Sonics and Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs  Another alternative is three guitarists  a bassist and a drummer  such as Radiohead  Foo Fighters  2010 today  and The Byrds  Some five person bands feature two guitarists  a keyboardist  a bassist and a drummer  with one or more of these musicians  typically one of the guitarists  handling lead vocals on top of their instrument  examples being Children of Bodom  Sturm und Drang  Relient K  Ensiferum and the current line up of Status Quo   In some cases  typically in cover bands  one musician plays either rhythm guitar or keyboards  depending on the song  one notable band being Firewind  with Bob Katsionis handling this particular role    Other times  the vocalist will bring another musical  voice  to the table  most commonly a harmonica or percussion  Mick Jagger  for example  played harmonica and percussion instruments like maracas and tambourine  Ozzy Osbourne was also known to play the harmonica on some occasions  i e   The Wizard  by Black Sabbath   Vocalist Robert Brown of lesser known steampunk band Abney Park plays harmonica  accordion  and darbuka in addition to mandolin   A less common lineup is to have lead vocals  two guitarists of varying types and two drummers  e g  Adam and the Ants   3 5  Larger rock ensembles  Larger bands have long been a part of rock and pop music  in part due to the influence of the  singer accompanied with orchestra  model inherited from popular big band jazz and swing and popularized by Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald To create larger ensembles  rock bands often add an additional guitarist  an additional keyboardist  additional percussionists or second drummer  an entire horn section  and even a flautist  An example of a six member rock band is Linkin Park with a lead vocalist  rap vocalist keyboardist  lead guitarist  bassist  turntablist  and drummer  The American heavy metal band Slipknot is composed of nine members  with a vocalist  two guitarists  a drummer  a bassist  two custom percussionists  a turntablist  and a sampler   In larger groups  such as The Band   instrumentalists could play multiple instruments  which enabled the ensemble to create a wider variety of instrument combinations  More modern examples of such a band are Arcade Fire and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros  More rarely  rock or pop groups will be accompanied in concerts by a full or partial symphony orchestra  where lush string orchestra arrangements are used to flesh out the sound of slow ballads   Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca started doing performances in the late 70s with orchestras consisting of ten to hundred  Branca  and even four hundred guitars  Chatham   Boredoms did performances with 77 drummers and 88 drummers in 2007 and 2008   4  Musical drama  Sung dramas such as operas and musicals usually have numbers where several of the principals are singing together  either on their own or with the chorus  Such numbers  duets  trios  etc   are also referred to as  ensembles    5  Other western musical ensembles  A choir is a group of voices  By analogy  sometimes a group of similar instruments in a symphony orchestra are referred to as a choir  For example  the woodwind instruments of a symphony orchestra could be called the woodwind choir   A group that plays popular music or military music is usually called a band  a drum and bugle corps is a type of the latter  These bands perform a wide range of music  ranging from arrangements of jazz orchestral  or popular music to military style marches  Drum corps perform on brass and percussion instruments only  Some corps perform on bugles in the key of G  while others perform on brass instruments in multiple keys  depending on the group  Drum and Bugle Corps incorporate costumes  hats  and pageantry in their performances   Other band types include   Brass bands  groups consisting of around 30 brass and percussion players   Jug bands   Mexican Mariachi groups typically consist of at least two violins  two trumpets  one Spanish guitar  one vihuela  a high pitched  five string guitar   and one Guitarrón  a Mexican acoustic bass that is roughly guitar shaped   and one or more singers   Marching bands and military bands  dating back to the Ottoman military bands   6  See also  All female band  Boy band  Girl group  List of musical ensemble formats  Live band karaoke  Percussion ensemble  7
