son of Helen Frances  née Winslow  and John Wallace Blunt  Sr   a writer and executive recruiter  Irving grew up in Exeter  as the stepson of a Phillips Exeter Academy faculty member  Colin Franklin Newell Irving  and nephew of another  H  Hamilton  Hammy  Bissell  1929   Irving was in the Phillips Exeter wrestling program both as a student athlete and as an assistant coach  and wrestling features prominently in his books  stories  and life  Irving s biological father  whom he never met  had been a pilot in the Army Air Forces and during World War II was shot down over Burma in July 1943  but survived  an incident incorporated into the novel The Cider House Rules   Irving did not find out about his father s heroism until 1981   2  Career  Irving s career began at the age of 26 with the publication of his first novel  Setting Free the Bears  1968   The novel was reasonably well reviewed but failed to gain a large readership  In the late 1960s  he studied with Kurt Vonnegut at the University of Iowa Writers  Workshop  His second and third novels  The Water Method Man  1972  and The 158 Pound Marriage  1974   were similarly received  In 1975  Irving accepted a position as assistant professor of English at Mount Holyoke College   Frustrated at the lack of promotion his novels were receiving from his first publisher  Random House  Irving offered his fourth novel  The World According to Garp  1978   to Dutton  which promised him stronger commitment to marketing  The novel became an international bestseller and cultural phenomenon  It was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction in 1979  received by Tim O Brien for Going After Cacciato  and its first paperback edition won the Award next year  Garp was later made into a film directed by George Roy Hill and starring Robin Williams in the title role and Glenn Close as his mother  it garnered several Academy Award nominations  including nominations for Close and John Lithgow  Irving makes a brief cameo in the film as an official in one of Garp s high school wrestling matches  The World According to Garp was among three books recommended to the Pulitzer Advisory Board for consideration for the 1979 Award in Fiction in the Pulitzer Jury Committee report  although the award was given to The Stories of John Cheever  1978    Garp transformed Irving from an obscure  academic literary writer to a household name  and his subsequent books were bestsellers  The next was The Hotel New Hampshire  1981   which sold well despite mixed reviews from critics  Like Garp  the novel was quickly made into a film  this time directed by Tony Richardson and starring Jodie Foster  Rob Lowe  and Beau Bridges   Interior Space   a short story published in Fiction magazine in 1980  was given an O  Henry Award  and thus collected in its eponymous anthology from 1981    In 1985  Irving published The Cider House Rules  An epic set in a Maine orphanage  the novel s central topic is abortion  Many drew parallels between the novel and Charles Dickens  Oliver Twist  1838   Irving s next novel was A Prayer for Owen Meany  1989   another New England family epic about religion set in a New England boarding school and in Toronto  The novel was influenced by The Tin Drum  1959  by Günter Grass  and the plot contains further allusions to The Scarlet Letter  1850  by Nathaniel Hawthorne and the works of Dickens  In Owen Meany  Irving for the first time examined the consequences of the Vietnam War—particularly mandatory conscription  which Irving avoided because he was a married father when of age for the draft  Owen Meany became Irving s best selling book since Garp  and is now a frequent feature on high school English reading lists   Irving returned to Random House for his next book  A Son of the Circus  1995   Arguably his most complicated and difficult book  and a departure from many of the themes and location settings in his previous novels  it was dismissed by critics but became a national bestseller on the strength of Irving s reputation for fashioning literate  engrossing page turners  Irving returned in 1998 with A Widow for One Year  which was named a New York Times Notable Book   Irving has had four novels reach number one on the bestseller list of The New York Times  The Hotel New Hampshire  September 27  1981   which stayed number one for seven weeks  and was in the top 15 for over 27 weeks  The Cider House Rules  June 16  1985   A Widow for One Year  June 14  1998   and The Fourth Hand  July 29  2001    In 1999  after nearly 10 years in development  Irving s screenplay for The Cider House Rules was made into a film directed by Lasse Hallström  starring Michael Caine  Tobey Maguire  Charlize Theron  and Delroy Lindo  Irving also made a cameo appearance as the disapproving stationmaster  The film was nominated for several Academy Awards  including Best Picture  and earned Irving an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay   Soon afterward  Irving wrote My Movie Business  a memoir about his involvement in creating the film version of The Cider House Rules  After its publication  Irving appeared on the CBC Television program Hot Type to promote the book  During the interview  Irving criticized bestselling American author Tom Wolfe  saying Wolfe  can t write   and that Wolfe s writing makes Irving gag  Wolfe appeared on Hot Type later that year  calling Irving  Norman Mailer  and John Updike his  three stooges  who were panicked by his newest novel  A Man in Full  1998    When Irving s 10th book  The Fourth Hand  2001   was published it became a bestseller  A Sound Like Someone Trying Not to Make a Sound  2004   a children s picture book originally included in A Widow for One Year  was published with illustrations by Tatjana Hauptmann  Irving s novel  Until I Find You  was released on July 12  2005   On June 28  2005  The New York Times published an article revealing that Until I Find You  2005  contains two specifically personal elements about his life that he had never before discussed publicly  his sexual abuse at age 11 by an older woman  and the recent entrance in his life of his biological father s family   In his 12th novel  Last Night in Twisted River  published in 2009  Irving s central character is a novelist with  a career that teasingly follows Irving s own   as one journalist put it  e g   including the aforementioned reference to Irving s own avoidance of mandatory conscription    3  Other projects  Since the publication of Garp made him independently wealthy  Irving has been able to concentrate solely on fiction writing as a vocation  sporadically accepting short term teaching positions  including one at his alma mater  the Iowa Writers  Workshop  and serving as an assistant coach on his sons  high school wrestling teams   Irving was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as an  Outstanding American  in 1992   In addition to his novels  he has also published Trying to Save Piggy Sneed  1996   a collection of his writings including a brief memoir and unpublished short fiction  My Movie Business  an account of the protracted process of bringing The Cider House Rules to the big screen  and The Imaginary Girlfriend  a short memoir focusing on writing and wrestling  In 2010  Irving revealed that he and Tod  Kip  Williams  director and writer of The Door in the Floor

Rules  A Prayer for Owen Meany  and A Widow for One Year  have been published in Modern Library editions  Owen Meany was adapted into the 1998 film Simon Birch  Irving required that the title and character names be changed because the screenplay s story was  markedly different  from that of the novel  Irving is on record as having enjoyed the film  however   In 2004  a portion of A Widow for One Year was adapted into The Door in the Floor  starring Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger   In a New York Magazine interview in 2009  Irving stated that he had begun work on a new novel  his 13th  based

One Person features a 60 year old  bisexual protagonist named William  looking back on his life in the 1950s and  60s  The novel shares a similar theme  and concern  with The World According to Garp  which was  in part  says Irving  about   People who hate you for your sexual differences    He won a Lambda Literary Award in 2013 in the Bisexual Fiction category for In One Person  and was also awarded the organization s Bridge Builder Award to honor him as an ally of the LGBT community   On June 10  2013  Irving revealed that his next novel  his 14th  will be titled Avenue of Mysteries
