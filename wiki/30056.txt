A Trojan horse  or Trojan  in computing is a generally non self replicating type of malware program containing malicious code that  when executed  carries out actions determined by the nature of the Trojan  typically causing loss or theft of data  and possible system harm  The term is derived from the story of the wooden horse used to trick defenders of Troy into taking concealed warriors into their city in ancient Anatolia  because computer Trojans often employ a form of social engineering  presenting themselves as routine  useful  or interesting in order to persuade victims to install them on their computers   A Trojan often acts as a backdoor  contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer  While Trojans and backdoors are not easily detectable by themselves  computers may appear to run slower due to heavy processor or network usage  Malicious programs are classified as Trojans if they do not attempt to inject themselves into other files  computer virus  or otherwise propagate themselves  worm   A computer may host a Trojan via a malicious program that a user is duped into executing  often an e mail attachment disguised to be unsuspicious  e g   a routine form to be filled in   or by drive by download   1  Purpose and uses  A Trojan may give a hacker remote access to a targeted computer system  Operations that could be performed by a hacker  or be caused unintentionally by program operation  on a targeted computer system include   Crashing the computer  e g  with  blue screen of death   BSOD   Data corruption  Formatting disks  destroying all contents  Use of the machine as part of a botnet  e g  to perform automated spamming or to distribute Denial of service attacks   Electronic money theft  Infects entire Network banking information and other connected devices  Data theft  including confidential files  sometimes for industrial espionage  and information with financial implications such as passwords and payment card information  Modification or deletion of files  Downloading or uploading of files for various purposes  Downloading and installing software  including third party malware and ransomware  Keystroke logging  Watching the user s screen  Viewing the user s webcam  Controlling the computer system remotely  Encrypting files  a ransom payment may be demanded for decryption  as with the CryptoLocker ransomware  Modifications of registry  Using computer resources for mining cryptocurrency  Linking computer to botnet  Using infected computer as proxy for illegal activities and attacks on other computers  More likely to be unintended or merely malicious  rather than criminal  consequences   Trojan horses in this way may require interaction with a malicious controller  not necessarily distributing the Trojan horse  to fulfill their purpose  It is possible for those involved with Trojans to scan computers on a network to locate any with a Trojan horse installed  which the hacker can then control   Some Trojans take advantage of a security flaw in older versions of Internet Explorer and Google Chrome to use the host computer as an anonymizer proxy to effectively hide Internet usage  enabling the controller to use the Internet for illegal purposes while all potentially incriminating evidence indicates the infected computer or its IP address  The host s computer may or may not show the internet history of the sites viewed using the computer as a proxy  The first generation of anonymizer Trojan horses tended to leave their tracks in the page view histories of the host computer  Later generations of the Trojan horse tend to  cover  their tracks more efficiently  Several versions of Sub7 have been widely circulated in the US and Europe and became the most widely distributed examples of this type of Trojan horse   In German speaking countries  spyware used or made by the government is sometimes called govware  Govware is typically a trojan horse software used to intercept communications from the target computer  Some countries like Switzerland and Germany have a legal framework governing the use of such software  Examples of govware trojans include the Swiss MiniPanzer and MegaPanzer and the German  state trojan  nicknamed R2D2   Due to the popularity of botnets among hackers and the availability of advertising services that permit authors to violate their users  privacy  Trojan horses are becoming more common  According to a survey conducted by BitDefender from January to June 2009   Trojan type malware is on the rise  accounting for 83 percent of the global malware detected in the world   Trojans have a relationship with worms  as they spread with the help given by worms and travel across the internet with them   The anti virus company BitDefender has stated that approximately 15% of computers are members of a botnet  usually recruited by a Trojan infection   2  Notable Trojan horses  Netbus Advance
