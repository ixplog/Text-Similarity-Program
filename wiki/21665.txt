Natural theology  once also called Physico theology  is a branch of theology which provides teleological arguments for the existence of God based on reason and ordinary experience of nature  This distinguishes it from revealed theology  which is based on scripture and religious experiences  and also from transcendental theology  which is based on a priori reasoning   Marcus Terentius Varro established a distinction between political theology  natural theology and mythical theology  His terminology entered the Stoic tradition and then Christianity through St  Augustine and St  Thomas Aquinas   Natural theology is thus a branch of philosophy  whose object is the nature of the gods  or of one supreme God  In monotheistic religions  this principally involves arguments about the attributes or non attributes of God  and especially the existence of God—arguments which do not involve recourse to supernatural revelation   1  Ancient Greece  Besides Zarathushtra s Gathas  Plato gives the earliest surviving account of a natural theology  In the Timaeus  written c  360 BC  we read   We must first investigate concerning  the whole Cosmos  that primary question which has to be investigated at the outset in every case  — namely  whether it has always existed  having no beginning or generation  or whether it has come into existence  having begun from some beginning   In the Laws  in answer to the question as to what arguments justify faith in the gods  Plato affirms   One is our dogma about the soul   the other is our dogma concerning the ordering of the motion of the stars    2  Ancient Rome  Marcus Terentius Varro  116–27 BC  in his  lost  Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum established a distinction between three kinds of theology  civil  political   theologia civilis   natural  physical   theologia naturalis  and mythical  theologia mythica   The theologians of civil theology are  the people   asking how the gods relate to daily life and the state  imperial cult   The theologians of natural theology are the philosophers  asking about the nature of the gods  and the theologians of mythical theology are the poets  crafting mythology   3  Middle ages  From the 8th century AD  the Mutazilite school of Islam  compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox Islam of their day  looked for support in philosophy  and were among the first to pursue a rational Islamic theology  called Ilm al Kalam  scholastic theology   The teleological argument was later presented by the early Islamic philosophers Alkindus and Averroes  while Avicenna presented both the cosmological argument and the ontological argument in The Book of Healing  1027    St  Thomas Aquinas  c 1225–1274  presented several versions of the cosmological argument in his Summa Theologica  and of the teleological argument in his Summa Contra Gentiles  He presented the ontological argument  but rejected it in favor of proofs that invoke cause and effect alone  His quinque viae   five ways   in those books attempted to prove the existence of God in different ways  including  as way #5  the goal directed actions seen in nature   4  Early modern onwards  John Ray  1627–1705  also known as John Wray  was an English naturalist  sometimes referred to as the father of English natural history  He published important works on plants  animals  and natural theology  with the objective  to illustrate the glory of God in the knowledge of the works of nature or creation    William Derham  1657–1735  continued Ray s tradition of natural theology in two of his own works  Physico Theology  published in 1713  and Astro Theology  1714  These later influenced the work of William Paley   In An Essay on the Principle of Population  published in 1798  Thomas Malthus ended with two chapters on natural theology and population  Malthus—a devout Christian—argued that revelation would  damp the soaring wings of intellect   and thus never let  the difficulties and doubts of parts of the scripture  interfere with his work   William Paley gave a well known rendition of the teleological argument for God  In 1802 he published Natural Theology  or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature  In this he described the Watchmaker analogy  for which he is probably best known  however  his book  which was one of the most published books of the 19th and 20th century  presents a number of teleological and cosmological arguments for the existence of God  The book served as a template for many subsequent natural theologies during the 19th century and  for those who did not agree with its argument  it served as a spring board to a variety of theologies of nature   Professor of chemistry and natural history  Edward Hitchcock also studied and wrote on natural theology  He attempted to unify and reconcile science and religion  focusing on geology  His major work in this area was The Religion of Geology and its Connected Sciences  1851    The Gifford Lectures were established by the will of Adam Lord Gifford to  promote and diffuse the study of Natural Theology in the widest sense of the term—in other words  the knowledge of God   The term natural theology as used by Gifford means theology supported by science and not dependent on the miraculous   5  The Bridgewater Treatises  Debates over the applicability of teleology to scientific questions came to a head in the nineteenth century  as Paley s argument about design came into conflict with radical new theories on the transmutation of species  In order to support the canonical scientific views at the time  which explored the natural world within Paley s framework of a divine designer  The Earl of Bridgewater  a gentleman naturalist  commissioned eight Bridgewater Treatises upon his deathbed to explore  the Power  Wisdom  and Goodness of God  as manifested in the Creation   They first appeared during the years 1833 to 1840  and afterwards in Bohn s Scientific Library  The treatises are   The Adaptation of External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Condition of Man  by Thomas Chalmers  D  D   On The Adaptation of

mathematicians of recent times any authority with regard to their views of the administration of the universe   Charles Babbage published what he called The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise  A Fragment  As his preface states  this volume was not part of that series  but rather his own reflections on the subject  He draws on his own work on calculating engines to consider God as a divine programmer setting complex laws underlying what we think of as miracles  rather than miraculously producing new species on a Creative whim  There was also a fragmentary supplement to this  posthumously published by Thomas Hill   The theology of the Bridgewater Treatises was often disputed  given that it assumed humans could have knowledge of God acquired by observation and reasoning without the aid of revealed knowledge   The works are of unequal merit  several of them took a high rank in apologetic literature  but they attracted considerable criticism  One notable critic of the Bridgewater Treatises was Edgar Allan Poe  who wrote Criticism  Robert Knox  an Edinburgh surgeon and leading advocate of radical morphology  referred to them as the  Bilgewater Treatises   to mock the  ultra teleological school   Though memorable  this phrase overemphasises the influence of teleology in the series  at the expense of the idealism of the likes of Kirby and Roget   6  See also  Deism
