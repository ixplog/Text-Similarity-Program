A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes directly behind the Earth into its umbra  shadow   This can occur only when the Sun  Earth  and Moon are aligned  in  syzygy   exactly  or very closely so  with the Earth in the middle  Hence  a lunar eclipse can only occur the night of a full moon  The type and length of an eclipse depend upon the Moon s location relative to its orbital nodes   Unlike a solar eclipse  which can only be viewed from a certain relatively small area of the world  a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of the Earth  A lunar eclipse lasts for a few hours  whereas a total solar eclipse lasts for only a few minutes at any given place  due to the smaller size of the moon s shadow  Also unlike solar eclipses  lunar eclipses are safe to view without any eye protection or special precautions  as they are dimmer than the full moon   For the date of the next eclipse see the section Recent and forthcoming lunar eclipses   1  Types of lunar eclipse  The shadow of the Earth can be divided into two distinctive parts  the umbra and penumbra  Within the umbra  there is no direct solar radiation  However  as a result of the Sun s large angular size  solar illumination is only partially blocked in the outer portion of the Earth s shadow  which is given the name penumbra   A penumbral eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through the Earth s penumbra  The penumbra causes a subtle darkening of the Moon s surface  A special type of penumbral eclipse is a total penumbral eclipse  during which the Moon lies exclusively within the Earth s penumbra  Total penumbral eclipses are rare  and when these occur  that portion of the Moon which is closest to the umbra can appear somewhat darker than the rest of the Moon   A partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a portion of the Moon enters the umbra  When the Moon travels completely into the Earth s umbra  one observes a total lunar eclipse  The Moon s speed through the shadow is about one kilometer per second  2 300 mph   and totality may last up to nearly 107 minutes  Nevertheless  the total time between the Moon s first and last contact with the shadow is much longer  and could last up to 4 hours  The relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of an eclipse can affect the eclipse s duration  In particular  when the Moon is near its apogee  the farthest point from the Earth in its orbit  its orbital speed is the slowest  The diameter of the umbra does not decrease appreciably within the changes in the orbital distance of the moon  Thus  a totally eclipsed Moon occurring near apogee will lengthen the duration of totality   1 1  Selenelion  A selenelion or selenehelion occurs when both the Sun and the eclipsed Moon can be observed at the same time  This can only happen just before sunset or just after sunrise  and both bodies will appear just above the horizon at nearly opposite points in the sky  This arrangement has led to the phenomenon being referred to as a horizontal eclipse  There are typically a number of high ridges undergoing sunrise or sunset that can see it  Although the Moon is in the Earth’s umbra  the Sun and the eclipsed Moon can both be seen at the same time because the refraction of light through the Earth’s atmosphere causes each of them to appear higher in the sky than their true geometric position   2  Timing  3  Danjon scale  The following scale  the Danjon scale  was devised by André Danjon for rating the overall darkness of lunar eclipses   4  Lunar versus solar eclipse  There is often confusion between a solar and lunar eclipse  While both involve interactions between the Sun  Earth  and Moon  they are very different in their interactions   4 1  Lunar eclipse appearance  The Moon does not completely disappear as it passes through the umbra because of the refraction of sunlight by the Earth’s atmosphere into the shadow cone  if the Earth had no atmosphere  the Moon would be completely dark during an eclipse  The red coloring arises because sunlight reaching the Moon must pass through a long and dense layer of the Earth’s atmosphere  where it is scattered  Shorter wavelengths are more likely to be scattered by the air molecules and the small particles  and so by the time the light has passed through the atmosphere  the longer wavelengths dominate  This resulting light we perceive as red  This is the same effect that causes sunsets and sunrises to turn the sky a reddish color  an alternative way of considering the problem is to realize that  as viewed from the Moon  the Sun would appear to be setting  or rising  behind the Earth   The amount of refracted light depends on the amount of dust or clouds in the atmosphere  this also controls how much light is scattered  In general  the dustier the atmosphere  the more that other wavelengths of light will be removed  compared to red light   leaving the resulting light a deeper red color  This causes the resulting coppery red hue of the Moon to vary from one eclipse to the next  Volcanoes are notable for expelling large quantities of dust into the atmosphere  and a large eruption shortly before an eclipse can have a large effect on the resulting color   4 2  Solar eclipse appearance  A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon casts its shadow on Earth whilst passing between the Sun and Earth  Because the Moon s orbit is 5 degrees tilted to the Earth s orbit around the Sun  a solar eclipse is rare  The Moon has an elliptical orbit around the Earth  so the separation of the two varies from about 221 000 to 252 000 miles  When the Moon s distance from the Earth is low  the Moon appears significantly larger and can completely obscure the Sun causing a Total Solar Eclipse  An Annular Solar Eclipse occurs when the Moon is furthest from the Earth  On these occasions the Moon will appear to be smaller and not fully eclipse the sun   5  March 1504 lunar eclipse  When Christopher Columbus came to the New World—specifically  the north coast of Jamaica—he was able to use the technology of Europe to correctly predict a lunar eclipse  The event is known as the March 1504 lunar eclipse  and occurred when Columbus  after he wanted to be seen as god like  stated that he would make the moon disappear during the night of February 29  1504  The reason Columbus wanted to prove he could make the moon disappear is because he and his crew were eating a great deal of the inhabitants  food  and the inhabitants refused to feed them anymore  Columbus was right in his prediction  for he used astronomical tables and local clocks in order to predict when the lunar eclipse would happen  and was able to convince the inhabitants that he had the power to make the moon disappear and then reappear  After the inhabitants believed that Columbus was truly able to make the moon disappear  they begged him to return the moon to its previous form  and after roughly an allotted amount of time  the amount of time Columbus discerned to be how long the eclipse would last   Columbus agreed to return the moon  and the moon began to reappear  The next day  the inhabitants gave Columbus and his crew the food they desired   6  Lunar eclipse in mythology  Several cultures have myths related to lunar eclipses  The Egyptians saw the eclipse as a sow swallowing the moon for a short time  other cultures view the eclipse as the moon being swallowed by other animals  such as a jaguar in Mayan tradition  or a three legged toad in China  Some societies thought it was a demon swallowing the moon  and that they could chase it away by throwing stones and curses at it   6 1  Incans  Similarly to the Mayans  the Incans believed that lunar eclipses were when a jaguar would eat the moon  which is why a blood moons look red  The Incans also believed that once the jaguar finished eating the moon  it could come down and devour all the animals on earth  so they would take spears and shout at the moon to keep it away   6 2  Mesopotamians  The ancient Mesopotamians believed that a lunar eclipse was when the moon was being attacked by seven demons  This attack was more than just one on the moon  however  for the Mesopotamians linked what happened in the sky with what happens on the land  and because the king of Mesopotamia represented the land  the seven demons were thought to be also attacking the king  In order to prevent this attack on the king  the Mesopotamians made someone pretend to be the king so they would be attacked instead of the true king  After the lunar eclipse was over  the substitute king was made to disappear  possibly by poisoning    6 3  Chinese  In Chinese believed that lunar eclipses was that when the Dragon is attempting to eat the moon  To cope with this effect  in ancient China  try to make loud noises to frighten the Dragon away  In the nineteenth century  during lunar eclipse  the Chinese navy fired its artillery because of this belief   7  Lunar eclipse in culture  Several cultures allude to the lunar eclipse as being a good or bad omen  For example  in some Chinese cultures  people would ring bells to remove wild animals that bit the moon  During the Zhou Dynasty in the Book of Songs  the sight of a red moon engulfed in darkness led them to believe the sign as a foreshadowing of famine or disease  The Greeks were ahead of their time when they said the earth was round and used the shadow from the Lunar Eclipse as evidence  Some Hindus believe in the importance of bathing in the Ganges River following an eclipse because it will help you achieve salvation  8  Blood moon  Due to its reddish color  a totally eclipsed moon is sometimes referred to as a  blood moon   In addition  in the 2010s the media started to associate the term  blood moon  with the four full moons of a lunar tetrad  especially the 2014–2015 tetrad coinciding with the feasts of Passover and Tabernacles  A lunar tetrad is a consecutive sequence of four lunar eclipses  spaced six months apart  The most recent blood moon occurred on October 8  2014 and was visible across much of the Americas and Asia  9  Occurrence  Every year  there are at least two lunar eclipses and as many as five  although total lunar eclipses are significantly less common  If one knows the date and time of an eclipse  it is possible to predict the occurrence of other eclipses using an eclipse cycle like the saros   9 1  Recent and forthcoming lunar eclipses  Eclipses only occur during an eclipse season  when the Sun is close to either the ascending or descending node of the Moon
