In logic and mathematics  and is the truth functional operator of logical conjunction  the and of a set of operands is true if and only if all of its operands are true  The logical connective that represents this operator is typically written as or     A and B  is true only if A is true and B is true   An operand of a conjunction is a conjunct   Related concepts in other fields are   In natural language  the coordinating conjunction  and    In programming languages  the short circuit and control structure   In set theory  intersection   In predicate logic  universal quantification   1  Notation  And is usually expressed with an infix operator  in mathematics and logic  ∧  in electronics    and in programming languages  8 or and  In Jan Łukasiewicz s prefix notation for logic  the operator is K  for Polish koniunkcja   2  Definition  Logical conjunction is an operation on two logical values  typically the values of two propositions  that produces a value of true if and only if both of its operands are true   The conjunctive identity is 1  which is to say that AND ing an expression with 1 will never change the value of the expression  In keeping with the concept of vacuous truth  when conjunction is defined as an operator or function of arbitrary arity  the empty conjunction  AND ing over an empty set of operands  is often defined as having the result 1   2 1  Truth

and B  Intuitively  it permits the inference of their conjunction   or in logical operator notation   Here is an example of an argument that fits the form conjunction introduction   Conjunction elimination is another classically valid  simple argument form  Intuitively  it permits the inference from any conjunction of either element of that conjunction      or alternately   In logical operator notation      or alternately   4  Properties  commutativity  yes  associativity  yes  distributivity  with various operations  especially with or  idempotency  yes  monotonicity  yes  truth

programming and digital electronics  logical conjunction is commonly represented by an infix operator  usually as a keyword such as  AND   an algebraic multiplication  or the ampersand symbol  &   Many languages also provide short circuit control structures corresponding to logical conjunction   Logical conjunction is often used for bitwise operations  where 0 corresponds to false and 1 to true   0 AND 0     0   0 AND 1     0   1 AND 0     0   1 AND 1     1  The operation can also be applied to two binary words viewed as bitstrings of equal length  by taking the bitwise AND of each pair of bits at corresponding positions  For example   11000110 AND 10100011     10000010  This can be used to select part of a bitstring using a bit mask  For example  10011101 AND 00001000     00001000 extracts the fifth bit of an 8 bit bitstring   In computer networking  bit masks are used to derive the network address of a subnet within an existing network from a given IP address  by ANDing the IP address and the subnet mask   Logical conjunction  AND  is also used in SQL operations to form database queries   The Curry Howard correspondence relates logical conjunction to product types   6  Set theoretic correspondence  The membership of an element of an intersection set in set theory is defined in terms of a logical conjunction  x ∈ A ∩ B if and only if  x ∈ A  ∧  x ∈ B   Through this correspondence  set theoretic intersection shares several properties with logical conjunction  such as associativity  commutativity  and idempotence   7  Natural language  As with other notions formalized in mathematical logic  the logical conjunction and is related to  but not the same as  the grammatical conjunction and in natural languages   English  and  has properties not captured by logical conjunction  For example   and  sometimes implies order  For example   They got married and had a child  in common discourse means that the marriage came before the child  The word  and  can also imply a partition of a thing into parts  as  The American flag is red  white  and blue   Here it is not meant that the flag is at once red  white  and blue  but rather that it has a part of each color   8  See also  And inverter graph  AND gate  Binary and  Bitwise AND  Boolean algebra  logic   Boolean algebra topics  Boolean conjunctive query  Boolean domain  Boolean function  Boolean valued
