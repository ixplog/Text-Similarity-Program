Joseph Alois Schumpeter    8 February 1883 – 8 January 1950  was an Austrian American economist and political scientist  He briefly served as Finance Minister of Austria in 1919  In 1932 he became a professor at Harvard University where he remained until the end of his career  One of the most influential economists of the 20th century  Schumpeter popularized the term  creative destruction  in economics   1  Life  Schumpeter was born in Třešť  Habsburg Moravia  now Czech Republic  then part of Austria Hungary  in 1883 to Catholic German speaking parents  His father owned a factory  but he died when Joseph was only four years old  In 1893  Joseph and his mother moved to Vienna   Schumpeter began his career studying law at the University of Vienna under the Austrian capital theorist Eugen von Böhm Bawerk  taking his PhD in 1906  In 1909  after some study trips  he became a professor of economics and government at the University of Czernowitz  In 1911  he joined the University of Graz  where he remained until World War I   In 1918  Schumpeter was a member of the Socialization Commission established by the Council of the People s Deputies in Germany  In March 1919  he was invited to take office as Minister of Finance in the Republic of German Austria  He proposed a capital levy as a way to tackle the war debt and opposed the socialization of the Alpine Mountain plant  In 1921  he became president of the private Biedermann Bank  He was also a board a member at the Kaufmann Bank  Problems at those banks left Schumpeter in debt  His resignation was a condition of the takeover of the Biedermann Bank in September 1924   From 1925 to 1932  Schumpeter held a chair at the University of Bonn  Germany  He lectured at Harvard in 1927–1928 and 1930  In 1931  he was a visiting professor at The Tokyo College of Commerce  In 1932  Schumpeter moved to the United States  and soon began what would become extensive efforts to help central European economist colleagues displaced by Nazism  Schumpeter also became known for his opposition to Marxism and socialism that he thought would lead to dictatorship  and even criticized President Franklin Roosevelt s New Deal  In 1939  Schumpeter became a US citizen  In the beginning of WWII  the FBI investigated him and his wife  a prominent scholar of Japanese economics  for pro Nazi leanings  but found no evidence of Nazi sympathies   At Harvard  Schumpeter was considered a memorable character  erudite and even showy in the classroom  He became known for his heavy teaching load and his personal and painstaking interest in his students  He served as the faculty advisor of the Graduate Economics Club and organized private seminars and discussion groups  Some colleagues thought his views outdated by Keynesianism which was fashionable  others resented his criticisms  particularly of their failure to offer an assistant professorship to Paul Samuelson  but recanted when they thought him likely to accept a position at Yale University  This period of his life was characterized by hard work and comparatively little recognition of his massive 2 volume book Business Cycles  However  the Schumpeters persevered  and in 1942 published what became the most popular of all his works  Capitalism  Socialism and Democracy  reprinted many times and in many languages in the following decades  as well as cited thousands of times   Although Schumpeter encouraged some young mathematical economists and was even the president of the Econometric Society  1940–1941   he was not a mathematician  and tried instead to integrate history and sociological understanding into his economic theories  Some argue that his ideas on business cycles and economic development could not be captured by the mathematics of his day because they involve non linear dynamical systems   Schumpeter claimed that he had set himself three goals in life  to be the greatest economist in the world  to be the best horseman in all of Austria and the greatest lover in all of Vienna  He said he had reached two of his goals  but he never said which two  although he is reported to have said that there were too many fine horsemen in Austria for him to succeed in all his aspirations   Schumpeter died in his home in Taconic  Connecticut  at the age of 66  on the night of 7 January 1950   He was married three times  His first wife was Gladys Ricarde Seaver  an Englishwoman nearly 12 years his senior  married 1907  separated 1913  divorced 1925   His best man at his wedding was his friend and Austrian jurist Hans Kelsen  His second was Anna Reisinger  20 years his junior and daughter of the concierge of the apartment where he grew up  They married in 1925  but within a year  she died in childbirth  The loss of his wife and newborn son came only weeks after Schumpeter s mother had died  In 1937  Schumpeter married the American economic historian Elizabeth Boody  who helped him popularize his work and edited what became their magnum opus  the posthumously published History of Economic Analysis   2  Central contributions  2 1  Influences  The source of Joseph Schumpeter s dynamic  change oriented  and innovation based economics was the Historical School of economics  Although his writings could be critical of the School  Schumpeter s work on the role of innovation and entrepreneurship can be seen as a continuation of ideas originated by the Historical School  especially the work of Gustav von Schmoller and Werner Sombart   2 2  Evolutionary economics  According to Christopher Freeman  2009   a scholar who devoted much time researching Schumpeter s work   the central point of his whole life work  is   that capitalism can only be understood as an evolutionary process of continuous innovation and  creative destruction     2 3  History of Economic Analysis  Schumpeter s scholarship is apparent in his posthumous History of Economic Analysis  although some of his judgments seem idiosyncratic and sometimes cavalier  For instance  Schumpeter thought that the greatest 18th century economist was Turgot  not Adam Smith  as many consider  and he considered Léon Walras to be the  greatest of all economists   beside whom other economists  theories were  like inadequate attempts to catch some particular aspects of Walrasian truth   Schumpeter criticized John Maynard Keynes and David Ricardo for the  Ricardian vice   According to Schumpeter  Ricardo and Keynes reasoned in terms of abstract models  where they would freeze all but a few variables  Then they could argue that one caused the other in a simple monotonic fashion  This led to the belief that one could easily deduce policy conclusions directly from a highly abstract theoretical model   In this book  Joseph Schumpeter recognized the implication of a gold monetary standard compared to a fiat monetary standard  In History of Economic Analysis  Schumpeter stated the following   An  automatic  gold currency is part and parcel of a laissez faire and free trade economy  It links every nation s money rates and price levels with the money rates and price levels of all the other nations that are  on gold   It is extremely sensitive to government expenditure and even to attitudes or policies that do not involve expenditure directly  for example  to foreign policy  to certain policies of taxation  and  in general  to precisely all those policies that violate the principles of  classical  liberalism  This is the reason why gold is so unpopular now and also why it was so popular in a bourgeois era   2 4  Business cycles  Schumpeter s relationships with the ideas of other economists were quite complex in his most important contributions to economic analysis – the theory of business cycles and development  Following neither Walras nor Keynes  Schumpeter starts in The Theory of Economic Development with a treatise of circular flow which  excluding any innovations and innovative activities  leads to a stationary state  The stationary state is  according to Schumpeter  described by Walrasian equilibrium  The hero of his story is the entrepreneur  The entrepreneur disturbs this equilibrium and is the prime cause of economic development  which proceeds in cyclic fashion along several time scales  In fashioning this theory connecting innovations  cycles  and development  Schumpeter kept alive the Russian Nikolai Kondratiev s ideas on 50 year cycles  Kondratiev waves   Schumpeter suggested a model in which the four main cycles  Kondratiev  54 years   Kuznets  18 years   Juglar  9 years  and Kitchin  about 4 years  can be added together to form a composite waveform  Actually there was considerable professional rivalry between Schumpeter and Kuznets  The wave form suggested here did not include the Kuznets Cycle simply because Schumpeter did not recognize it as a valid cycle  See  business cycle  for further information  A Kondratiev wave could consist of three lower degree Kuznets waves  Each Kuznets wave could  itself  be made up of two Juglar waves  Similarly two  or three  Kitchin waves could form a higher degree Juglar wave  If each of these were in phase  more importantly if the downward arc of each was simultaneous so that the nadir of each was coincident it would explain disastrous slumps and consequent depressions  As far as the segmentation of the Kondratiev Wave  Schumpeter never proposed such a fixed model  He saw these cycles varying in time – although in a tight time frame by coincidence – and for each to serve a specific purpose   2 5  Keynesianism  In Schumpeter s theory  Walrasian equilibrium is not adequate to capture the key mechanisms of economic development  Schumpeter also thought that the institution enabling the entrepreneur to buy the resources needed to realize his or her vision was a well developed capitalist financial system  including a whole range of institutions for granting credit  One could divide economists among  1  those who emphasized  real  analysis and regarded money as merely a  veil  and  2  those who thought monetary institutions are important and money could be a separate driving force  Both Schumpeter and Keynes were among the latter   2 6  Demise of capitalism  Schumpeter s most popular book in English is probably Capitalism  Socialism and Democracy  While he agrees with Karl Marx that capitalism will collapse and be replaced by socialism  Schumpeter predicts a different way this will come about  While Marx predicted that capitalism would be overthrown by a violent proletarian revolution  which actually occurred in the least capitalist countries  Schumpeter believed that capitalism would gradually weaken by itself and eventually collapse  Specifically  the success of capitalism would lead to corporatism and to values hostile to capitalism  especially among intellectuals   Intellectuals  are a social class in a position to critique societal matters for which they are not directly responsible and to stand up for the interests of other classes  Intellectuals tend to have a negative outlook of capitalism  even while relying on it for prestige  because their professions rely on antagonism toward it  The growing number of people with higher education is a great advantage of capitalism  according to Schumpeter  Yet  unemployment and a lack of fulfilling work will cause intellectual critique  discontent and protests  Parliaments will increasingly elect social democratic parties  and democratic majorities will vote for restrictions on entrepreneurship  Increasing workers  self management  industrial democracy and regulatory institutions would evolve non politically into  liberal capitalism   Thus  the intellectual and social climate needed for thriving entrepreneurship will be replaced by some form of  laborism   This will restrict  creative destruction   a borrowed phrase to denote an endogenous replacement of which old ways of doing things by new ways  and so will burden and destroy the capitalist structure   Schumpeter emphasizes throughout this book that he is analyzing trends  not engaging in political advocacy   2 7  Democratic theory  In the same book  Schumpeter expounded a theory of democracy which sought to challenge what he called the  classical doctrine   He disputed the idea that democracy was a process by which the electorate identified the common good  and politicians carried this out for them  He argued this was unrealistic  and that people s ignorance and superficiality meant that in fact they were largely manipulated by politicians  who set the agenda  This made a  rule by the people  concept both unlikely and undesirable  Instead he advocated a minimalist model  much influenced by Max Weber  whereby democracy is the mechanism for competition between leaders  much like a market structure  Although periodic votes by the general public legitimize governments and keep them accountable  the policy program is very much seen as their own and not that of the people  and the participatory role for individuals is usually severely limited   2 8  Entrepreneurship  Schumpeter was probably the first scholar to theorize about entrepreneurship  and the field owed much to his contributions  His fundamental theories are often referred to as Mark I and Mark II  In the first  Schumpeter argued that the innovation and technological change of a nation come from the entrepreneurs  or wild spirits  He coined the word Unternehmergeist  German for  entrepreneur spirit   and asserted that      the doing of new things or the doing of things that are already being done in a new way  stemmed directly from the efforts of entrepreneurs   Mark II was developed when Schumpeter was a professor at Harvard  Many social economists and popular authors of the day argued that large businesses had a negative effect on the standard of living of ordinary people  Contrary to this prevailing opinion  Schumpeter argued that the agents that drive innovation and the economy are large companies which have the capital to invest in research and development of new products and services and to deliver them to customers cheaper  thus raising their standard of living  In one of his seminal works   Capitalism  Socialism and Democracy   Schumpeter wrote   Mark I and Mark II arguments are considered complementary today   2 9  Cycles and long wave theory  Schumpeter was the most influential thinker to argue that long cycles are caused by innovation  and are an incident of it  His treatise on business cycles developed were based on Kondratiev s ideas which attributed the causes very differently  Schumpeter s treatise brought Kondratiev s ideas to the attention of English speaking economists  Kondratiev fused important elements that Schumpeter missed  Yet  the Schumpeterian variant of long cycles hypothesis  stressing the initiating role of innovations  commands the widest attention today  In Schumpeter s view  technological innovation is at the cause of both cyclical instability and economic growth  Fluctuations in innovation cause fluctuation in investment and those cause cycles in economics growth  Schumpeter sees innovations as clustering around certain points in time periods that he refers to as  neighborhoods of equilibrium   when entrepreneurs perceive that risk and returns warrant innovative commitments  These clusters lead to long cycles by generating periods of acceleration in aggregate growth   The technological view of change needs to demonstrate that changes in the rate of innovation governs changes in the rate of new investments  and that the combined impact of innovation clusters takes the form of fluctuation in aggregate output or employment  The process of technological innovation involves extremely complex relations among a set of key variables  inventions  innovations  diffusion paths and investment activities  The impact of technological innovation on aggregate output is mediated through a succession of relationships that have yet to be explored systematically in the context of long wave  New inventions are typically primitive  their performance is usually poorer than existing technologies and the cost of their production is high  A production technology may not yet exist  as is often the case in major chemical inventions  pharmaceutical inventions  The speed with which inventions are transformed into innovations and diffused depends on actual and expected trajectory of performance improvement and cost reduction   2 10  Innovation  Schumpeter identified innovation as the critical dimension of economic change  He argued that economic change revolves around innovation  entrepreneurial activities  and market power  He sought to prove that innovation originated market power can provide better results than the invisible hand and price competition  He argues that technological innovation often creates temporary monopolies  allowing abnormal profits that would soon be competed away by rivals and imitators  These temporary monopolies were necessary to provide the incentive for firms to develop new products and processes   3  Legacy  For some time after his death  Schumpeter s views were most influential among various heterodox economists  especially European  who were interested in industrial organization  evolutionary theory  and economic development  and who tended to be on the other end of the political spectrum from Schumpeter and were also often influenced by Keynes  Karl Marx  and Thorstein Veblen  Robert Heilbroner was one of Schumpeter s most renowned pupils  who wrote extensively about him in The Worldly Philosophers  In the journal Monthly Review John Bellamy Foster wrote of that journal s founder Paul Sweezy  one of the leading Marxist economists in the United States and a graduate assistant of Schumpeter s at Harvard  that Schumpeter  played a formative role in his development as a thinker   Other outstanding students of Schumpeter s include the economists Nicholas Georgescu Roegen and Hyman Minsky and former chairman of the Federal Reserve  Alan Greenspan  Future Nobel Laureate Robert Solow was his student at Harvard  and he expanded on Schumpeter s theory   Today  Schumpeter has a following outside standard textbook economics  in areas such as economic policy  management studies  industrial policy  and the study of innovation  Schumpeter was probably the first scholar to develop theories about entrepreneurship  For instance  the European Union s innovation program  and its main development plan  the Lisbon Strategy  are influenced by Schumpeter  The International Joseph A  Schumpeter Society awards the Schumpeter Prize   The Schumpeter School of Business and Economics opened in October 2008 at the University of Wuppertal  According to University President Professor Lambert T  Koch   Schumpeter will not only be the name of the Faculty of Management and Economics  but this is also a research and teaching programme related to Joseph A  Schumpeter    On 17 September 2009  The Economist inaugurated a column on business and management named  Schumpeter   The publication has a history of naming columns after significant figures or symbols in the covered field  including naming its British affairs column after former editor Walter Bagehot and its European affairs column after Charlemagne  The initial Schumpeter column praised him as a  champion of innovation and entrepreneurship  whose writing showed an understanding of the benefits and dangers of business that proved to be far ahead of its time   4  Major works  4 1  Books  of preface by F A  Hayek and first eight pages   Translated from the 1911 original German  Theorie der wirtschaftlichen
