PostgreSQL  often simply  Postgres   is an object relational database management system  ORDBMS  with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance  As a database server  its primary function is to store data  securely and supporting best practices  and retrieve it later  as requested by other software applications  be it those on the same computer or those running on another computer across a network  including the Internet   It can handle workloads ranging from small single machine applications to large Internet facing applications with many concurrent users  Recent versions also provide replication of the database itself for availability and scalability   PostgreSQL implements the majority of the SQL 2011 standard  is ACID compliant and transactional  including most DDL statements  avoiding locking issues using multiversion concurrency control  MVCC   provides immunity to dirty reads and full serializability  handles complex SQL queries using many indexing methods that are not available in other databases  has updateable views and materialized views  triggers  foreign keys  supports functions and stored procedures  and other expandability  and has a large number of extensions written by third parties  In addition to the possibility of working with the major proprietary and open source databases  PostgreSQL supports migration from them  by its extensive standard SQL support and available migration tools  And if proprietary extensions had been used  by its extensibility that can emulate many through some built in and third party open source compatibility extensions  such as for Oracle   PostgreSQL is cross platform and runs on many operating systems including Linux  FreeBSD  Solaris  and Microsoft Windows  Mac OS X  starting with OS X 10 7 Lion  has the server as its standard default database in the server edition  and PostgreSQL client tools in the desktop edition  The vast majority of Linux distributions have it available in supplied packages   PostgreSQL is developed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group  a diverse group of many companies and individual contributors  It is free and open source software  released under the terms of the PostgreSQL License  a permissive free software license   1  Name  PostgreSQL s developers pronounce it   It is abbreviated as Postgres  its original name  Because of ubiquitous support for the SQL Standard among most relational databases  the community considered changing the name back to Postgres  However  the PostgreSQL Core Team announced in 2007 that the product would continue to use the name PostgreSQL  The name refers to the project s origins as a  post Ingres  database  being a development from University Ingres DBMS  Ingres being an abbreviation for INteractive Graphics Retrieval System    2  History  PostgreSQL evolved from the Ingres project at the University of California  Berkeley  In 1982 the leader of the Ingres team  Michael Stonebraker  left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres  He returned to Berkeley in 1985 and started a post Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s  The new project  POSTGRES  aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support types  These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships – something used widely before but maintained entirely by the user  In Postgres  the database  understood  relationships  and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using rules  Postgres used many of the ideas of Ingres  but not its code   Starting in 1986  the POSTGRES team published a number of papers describing the basis of the system  and by 1988 had a prototype version  The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989  then version 2 with a re written rules system in June 1990  Version 3  released in 1991  again re wrote the rules system  and added support for multiple storage managers and an improved query engine  By 1993 the great number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features  After releasing version 4 — primarily a cleanup — the project ended   But developers of open source software could obtain copies and develop the system further  because Berkeley had released Postgres under an MIT style license  In 1994  Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the Ingres based QUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language  creating Postgres95  Yu and Chen released the code on the web   In July 1996  Marc Fournier at Hub org Networking Services provided the first non university development server for the open source development effort  With the participation of Bruce Momjian and Vadim B  Mikheev  work began to stabilize the code inherited from Berkeley  The first open source version was released on August 1  1996   In 1996 the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL  The first PostgreSQL release formed version 6 0 in January 1997  Since then a group of database developers and volunteers around the world have maintained the software  coordinating via the Internet   The PostgreSQL project continues to make major releases  approximately annually  and minor  bugfix  releases  all available under its free and open source software PostgreSQL License  Code comes from contributions from proprietary vendors  support companies  and open source programmers at large   See also Release history below   3  Multiversion concurrency control  MVCC   PostgreSQL manages concurrency through a system known as multiversion concurrency control  MVCC   which gives each transaction a  snapshot  of the database  allowing changes to be made without being visible to other transactions until the changes are committed  This largely eliminates the need for read locks  and ensures the database maintains the ACID  atomicity  consistency  isolation  durability  principles in an efficient manner  PostgreSQL offers three levels of transaction isolation  Read Committed  Repeatable Read and Serializable  Because PostgreSQL is immune to dirty reads  requesting a Read Uncommitted transaction isolation level provides read committed instead  Prior to PostgreSQL 9 1  requesting Serializable provided the same isolation level as Repeatable Read  PostgreSQL 9 1 and later support full serializability via the serializable snapshot isolation  SSI  technique   4  Storage and replication  4 1  Replication  PostgreSQL  beginning with version 9 0  includes built in binary replication  based on shipping the changes  write ahead logs  to slave systems asynchronously   Version 9 0 also introduced the ability to run read only queries against these replicated slaves  where earlier versions would only allow that after promoting them to be a new master  This allows splitting read traffic among multiple nodes efficiently  Earlier replication software that allowed similar read scaling normally relied on adding replication triggers to the master  introducing additional load onto it   Beginning from version 9 1  PostgreSQL also includes built in synchronous replication that ensures that  for each write transaction  the master waits until at least one slave node has written the data to its transaction log  Unlike other database systems  the durability of a transaction  whether it is asynchronous or synchronous  can be specified per database  per user  per session or even per transaction  This can be useful for work loads that do not require such guarantees  and may not be wanted for all data as it will have some negative effect on performance due to the requirement of the confirmation of the transaction reaching the synchronous standby   There can be a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous standby servers  A list of synchronous standby servers can be specified in the configuration which determines which servers are candidates for synchronous replication  The first in the list which is currently connected and actively streaming is the one that will be used as the current synchronous server  When this fails  it falls to the next in line   Synchronous multi master replication is currently not included in the PostgreSQL core  Postgres XC which is based on PostgreSQL provides scalable synchronous multi master replication  available in version 1 1 is licensed under the same license as PostgreSQL  A similar project is called Postgres XL and is available under the Mozilla Public License   The community has also written some tools to make managing replication clusters easier  such as repmgr   There are also several asynchronous trigger based replication packages for PostgreSQL  These remain useful even after introduction of the expanded core capabilities  for situations where binary replication of an entire database cluster is not the appropriate approach   Slony

built in support for regular B tree and hash indexes  and two types of inverted indexes  generalized search trees  GiST  and generalized inverted indexes  GIN   Hash indexes are implemented  but discouraged because they cannot be recovered after a crash or power loss  In addition  user defined index methods can be created  although this is quite an involved process  Indexes in PostgreSQL also support the following features   Expression indexes can be created with an index of the result of an expression or function  instead of simply the value of a column   Partial indexes  which only index part of a table  can be created by adding a WHERE clause to the end of the CREATE INDEX statement  This allows a smaller index to be created   The planner is capable of using multiple indexes together to satisfy complex queries  using temporary in memory bitmap index operations   As of PostgreSQL 9 1  k nearest neighbors  k NN  indexing  also referred to KNN GiST  provides efficient searching of  closest values  to that specified  useful to finding similar words  or close objects or locations with geospatial data  This is achieved without exhaustive matching of values   In PostgreSQL 9 2 and above  index only scans often allow the system to fetch data from indexes without ever having to access the main table   4 3  Schemas  In PostgreSQL  all objects  with the exception of roles and tablespaces  are held within a schema  Schemas effectively act like namespaces  allowing objects of the same name to co exist in the same database  Schemas are analogous to directories in a file system  except that they cannot be nested  nor is it possible to create a  symbolic link  pointing to another schema or object   By default  databases are created with the  public  schema  but any additional schemas can be added  and the public schema isn t mandatory  A  search path  determines the order in which schemas are checked on unqualified objects  those without a prefixed schema   which can be configured on a database or role level  The search path  by default  contains the special schema name of  $user   which first looks for a schema named after the connected database user  e g  if the user  dave  were connected  it would first look for a schema also named  dave  when referring to any objects   If such a schema is not found  it then proceeds to the next schema  New objects are created in whichever valid schema  one that presently exists  is listed first in the search path   4 4  Data types  A wide variety of native data types are supported  including   Boolean  Arbitrary precision numerics  Character  text  varchar  char   Binary  Date time  timestamp time with without timezone  date  interval   Money  Enum  Bit strings  Text search type  Composite  HStore  an extension enabled key value store within Postgres   Arrays  variable length and can be of any data type  including text and composite types  up to 1 GB in total storage size   Geometric primitives  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses  CIDR blocks and MAC addresses  XML supporting XPath queries  UUID  JSON  versions 9 2 and up  In addition  users can create their own data types which can usually be made fully indexable via PostgreSQL s GiST infrastructure  Examples of these include the geographic information system  GIS  data types from the PostGIS project for PostgreSQL   There is also a data type called a  domain   which is the same as any other data type but with optional constraints defined by the creator of that domain  This means any data entered into a column using the domain will have to conform to whichever constraints were defined as part of the domain   Starting with PostgreSQL 9 2  a data type that represents a range of data can be used which are called range types  These can be discrete ranges  e g  all integer values 1 to 10  or continuous ranges  e g  any point in time between 10 00 am and 11 00 am   The built in range types available include ranges of integers  big integers  decimal numbers  time stamps  with and without time zone  and dates   Custom range types can be created to make new types of ranges available  such as IP address ranges using the inet type as a base  or float ranges using the float data type as a base  Range types support inclusive and exclusive range boundaries using the    and    characters respectively   e g    4 9   represents all integers starting from and including 4 up to but not including 9   Range types are also compatible with existing operators used to check for overlap  containment  right of etc   4 5  User defined objects  New types of almost all objects inside the database can be created  including   Casts  Conversions  Data types  Domains  Functions  including aggregate functions and window functions  Indexes including custom indexes for custom types  Operators  existing ones can be overloaded   Procedural languages  4 6  Inheritance  Tables can be set to inherit their characteristics from a  parent  table  Data in child tables will appear to exist in the parent tables  unless data is selected from the parent table using the ONLY keyword  i e  SELECT * FROM ONLY parent table  Adding a column in the parent table will cause that column to appear in the child table   Inheritance can be used to implement table partitioning  using either triggers or rules to direct inserts to the parent table into the proper child tables   this feature is not fully supported yet—in particular  table constraints are not currently inheritable  All check constraints and not null constraints on a parent table are automatically inherited by its children  Other types of constraints  unique  primary key  and foreign key constraints  are not inherited   Inheritance provides a way to map the features of generalization hierarchies depicted in Entity Relationship Diagrams  ERD  directly into the PostgreSQL database   4 7  Other storage features  Referential integrity constraints including foreign key constraints  column constraints  and row checks  Binary and textual large object storage  Tablespaces  Per column collation  from 9 1   Online backup  Point in time recovery  implemented using write ahead logging  In place upgrades with pg upgrade for less downtime  supports upgrades from 8 3 x and later   5  Control and connectivity  5 1  Foreign data wrappers  As of version 9 1  PostgreSQL can link to other systems to retrieve data via foreign data wrappers  FDWs   These can take the form of any data source  such as a file system  another RDBMS  or a web service  This means regular database queries can use these data sources like regular tables  and even join multiple data sources together   5 2  Interfaces  PostgreSQL has several interfaces available and is also widely supported among programming language libraries  Built in interfaces include libpq  PostgreSQL s official C application interface  and ECPG  an embedded C system   External interfaces include   libpqxx  C++ interface  PostgresDAC  PostgresDAC  for Embarcadero RadStudio Delphi CBuilder XE XE3   DBD  Pg  Perl DBI driver  JDBC  JDBC interface  Lua  Lua interface  Npgsql   NET data provider  ST Links SpatialKit  Link Tool to ArcGIS  node postgres  Node js interface  pgoledb  OLEDB interface  psqlODBC  ODBC interface  psycopg2  Python interface  also used by HTSQL   pgtclng  Tcl interface  pyODBC  Python library  php5 pgsql  PHP driver based on libpq  postmodern  A Common Lisp interface  5 3  Procedural languages  Procedural languages allow developers to extend the database with custom subroutines  functions   often called stored procedures  These functions can be used to build triggers  functions invoked upon modification of certain data  and custom aggregate functions  Procedural languages can also be invoked without defining a function  using the  DO  command at SQL level   Languages are divided into two groups   Safe  languages are sandboxed and can be safely used by any user  Procedures written in  unsafe  languages can only be created by superusers  because they allow bypassing the database s security restrictions  but can also access sources external to the database  Some languages like Perl provide both safe and unsafe versions   PostgreSQL has built in support for three procedural languages   Plain SQL  safe   Simpler SQL functions can get expanded inline into the calling  SQL  query  which saves function call overhead and allows the query optimizer to  see inside  the function   PL pgSQL  safe   which resembles Oracle s PL SQL procedural language and SQL PSM   C  unsafe   which allows loading custom shared libraries into the database  Functions written in C offer the best performance  but bugs in code can crash and potentially corrupt the database  Most built in functions are written in C  In addition  PostgreSQL allows procedural languages to be loaded into the database through extensions  Three language extensions are included with PostgreSQL to support Perl  Python and Tcl  There are external projects to add support for many other languages  including Java  JavaScript  PL V8   R   5 4  Triggers  Triggers are events triggered by the action of SQL DML statements  For example  an INSERT statement might activate a trigger that checks if the values of the statement are valid  Most triggers are only activated by either INSERT or UPDATE statements   Triggers are fully supported and can be attached to tables  In PostgreSQL 9 0 and above  triggers can be per column and conditional  in that UPDATE triggers can target specific columns of a table  and triggers can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the trigger s WHERE clause  As of PostgreSQL 9 1  triggers can be attached to views by utilising the INSTEAD OF condition  Views in versions prior to 9 1 can have rules  though  Multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order  In addition to calling functions written in the native PL pgSQL  triggers can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL Python or PL Perl   5 5  Asynchronous notifications  PostgreSQL provides an asynchronous messaging system that is accessed through the NOTIFY  LISTEN and UNLISTEN commands  A session can issue a NOTIFY command  along with the user specified channel and an optional payload  to mark a particular event occurring  Other sessions are able to detect these events by issuing a LISTEN command  which can listen to a particular channel  This functionality can be used for a wide variety of purposes  such as letting other sessions know when a table has updated or for separate applications to detect when a particular action has been performed  Such a system prevents the need for continuous polling by applications to see if anything has yet changed  and reducing unnecessary overhead  Notifications are fully transactional  in that messages are not sent until the transaction they were sent from is committed  This eliminates the problem of messages being sent for an action being performed which is then rolled back   Many of the connectors for PostgreSQL provide support for this notification system  including libpq  JDBC  Npgsql  psycopg and node js  so it can be used by external applications   5 6  Rules  Rules allow the  query tree  of an incoming query to be rewritten  Rules  or more properly   Query Re Write Rules   are attached to a table class and  Re Write  the incoming DML  select  insert  update  and or delete  into one or more queries that either replace the original DML statement or execute in addition to it  Query Re Write occurs after DML statement parsing  but before query planning   5 7  Other querying features  Transactions  Full text search  Views  Materialized views  Updateable views  Recursive views  Inner  outer  full  left and right   and cross joins  Sub selects  Correlated sub queries  Regular expressions  Common table expressions and writable common table expressions  Encrypted connections via TLS  current versions do no use vulnerable SSL  even with that configuration option   Domains  Savepoints  Two phase commit  TOAST  The Oversized Attribute Storage Technique  is used to transparently store large table attributes  such as big MIME attachments or XML messages  in a separate area  with automatic compression   Embedded SQL is implemented using preprocessor  SQL code is first written embedded into C code  Then code is run through ECPG preprocessor  which replaces SQL with calls to code library  Then code can be compiled using a C compiler  Embedding works also with C++ but it does not recognize all C++ constructs   6  Security  Security within the database is managed on a per role basis  A role is generally regarded to be a user  a role that can log in   or a group  a role of which other roles are members   Permissions can be granted or revoked on any object down to the column level  and can also allow prevent the creation of new objects at the database  schema or table levels   The sepgsql extension  provided with PostgreSQL as of version 9 1  provides an additional layer of security by integrating with SELinux  This utilises PostgreSQL s SECURITY LABEL feature   PostgreSQL natively supports a broad number of external authentication mechanisms including   password  either MD5 or plain text   GSSAPI  SSPI  Kerberos  ident  maps O S user name as provided by an ident server to database user name   peer  maps local user name to database user name   LDAP  Active Directory  RADIUS  certificate  PAM The GSSAPI  SSPI  Kerberos  peer  ident and certificate methods can also use a specified  map  file that lists which users matched by that authentication system are allowed to connect as a specific database user   These methods are specified in the cluster s host based authentication configuration file  pg hba conf   which determines what connections are allowed  This allows control over which user can connect to which database  where they can connect from  IP address IP address range domain socket   which authentication system will be enforced  and whether the connection must use TLS   7  Upcoming features  Upcoming features in 9 5  in order of commit  include   IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA to import foreign tables from a foreign schema  meaning tables no longer have to be manually configured  ALTER TABLE     SET LOGGED   UNLOGGED for switching tables between logged and unlogged states  Row Level Security Policies for controlling which rows are visible or can be added to a table  SKIP LOCKED for row level locks  BRIN  Block Range Indexes  to speed up queries on very large tables  8  Add ons  MADlib  an open source analytics library for PostgreSQL providing mathematical  statistical and machine learning methods for structured and unstructured data  MySQL migration wizard  included with EnterpriseDB s PostgreSQL installer  source code also available   Performance Wizard  included with EnterpriseDB s PostgreSQL installer  source code also available   pgRouting  extended PostGIS to provide geospatial routing functionality  GNU GPL   PostGIS  a popular add on which provides support for geographic objects  GNU GPL   Postgres Enterprise Manager  a non free tool consisting of a service  multiple agents  and a GUI which provides remote monitoring  management  reporting  capacity planning and tuning  ST Links SpatialKit  Extension for directly connecting to spatial databases  9  Benchmarks and performance  Many informal performance studies of PostgreSQL have been done  Performance improvements aimed at improving scalability started heavily with version 8 1  Simple benchmarks between version 8 0 and version 8 4 showed that the latter was more than 10 times faster on read only workloads and at least 7 5 times faster on both read and write workloads   The first industry standard and peer validated benchmark was completed in June 2007 using the Sun Java System Application Server  proprietary version of GlassFish  9 0 Platform Edition  UltraSPARC T1 based Sun Fire server and Postgres 8 2  This result of 778 14 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard compares favourably with the 874 JOPS@Standard with Oracle 10 on an Itanium based HP UX system   In August 2007  Sun submitted an improved benchmark score of 813 73 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard  With the system under test at a reduced price  the price performance improved from $US 84 98 JOPS to $US 70 57 JOPS   The default configuration of PostgreSQL uses only a small amount of dedicated memory for performance critical purposes such as caching database blocks and sorting  This limitation is primarily because older operating systems required kernel changes to allow allocating large blocks of shared memory  PostgreSQL org provides advice on basic recommended performance practice in a wiki   In April 2012  Robert Haas of EnterpriseDB demonstrated PostgreSQL 9 2 s linear CPU scalability using a server with 64 cores   10  Platforms  PostgreSQL is available for the following operating systems  Linux  all recent distributions   Windows  Windows 2000 SP4 and later   compilable by e g  Visual Studio  now with up to most recent 2013 version   DragonFly BSD  FreeBSD  OpenBSD  NetBSD  Mac OS X  AIX  BSD OS  HP UX  IRIX  OpenIndiana  OpenSolaris  SCO OpenServer  SCO UnixWare  Solaris and Tru64 Unix  As of 2012  support for the following obsolete systems was removed  DG UX  NeXTSTEP  SunOS 4  SVR4  Ultrix 4  and Univel  Most other Unix like systems should also work   PostgreSQL works on any of the following instruction set architectures  x86 and x86 64 on Windows and other operatings systems  other than Windows  IA 64 Itanium  PowerPC  PowerPC 64  S 390  S 390x  SPARC  SPARC 64  Alpha  ARMv8 A  64 bit  and older ARM  32 bit   MIPS  MIPSel  M68k  and PA RISC  It is also known to work on M32R  NS32k  and VAX  In addition to these  it is possible to build PostgreSQL for an unsupported CPU by disabling spinlocks   11  Database administration  Open source front ends and tools for administering PostgreSQL include     psql  The primary front end for PostgreSQL is the psql command line program  which can be used to enter SQL queries directly  or execute them from a file  In addition  psql provides a number of meta commands and various shell like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks  for example tab completion of object names and SQL syntax    pgAdmin  The pgAdmin package is a free and open source graphical user interface administration tool for PostgreSQL  which is supported on many computer platforms  The program is available in more than a dozen languages  The first prototype  named pgManager  was written for PostgreSQL 6 3 2 from 1998  and rewritten and released as pgAdmin under the GNU General Public License  GPL  in later months  The second incarnation  named pgAdmin II  was a complete rewrite  first released on January 16  2002  The third version  pgAdmin III  was originally released under the Artistic License and then released under the same license as PostgreSQL  Unlike prior versions that were written in Visual Basic  pgAdmin III is written in C++  using the wxWidgets framework allowing it to run on most common operating systems    phpPgAdmin  phpPgAdmin is a web based administration tool for PostgreSQL written in PHP and based on the popular phpMyAdmin interface originally written for MySQL administration    PostgreSQL Studio  PostgreSQL Studio allows users to perform essential PostgreSQL database development tasks from a web based console  PostgreSQL Studio allows users to work with cloud databases without the need to open firewalls    TeamPostgreSQL  AJAX JavaScript driven web interface for PostgreSQL  Allows browsing  maintaining and creating data and database objects via a web browser  The interface offers tabbed SQL editor with auto completion  row editing widgets  click through foreign key navigation between rows and tables   favorites  management for commonly used scripts  among other features  Supports SSH for both the web interface and the database connections  Installers are available for Windows  Mac and Linux  as well as a simple cross platform archive that runs from a script    LibreOffice OpenOffice org Base  LibreOffice OpenOffice org Base can be used as a front end for PostgreSQL    pgFouine  The pgFouine PostgreSQL log analyzer generates detailed reports from a PostgreSQL log file and provides VACUUM analysis   A number of companies offer proprietary tools for PostgreSQL  They often consist of a universal core that is adapted for various specific database products  These tools mostly share the administration features with the open source tools but offer improvements in data modeling  importing  exporting or reporting   12  Prominent users  Prominent organizations and products that use PostgreSQL as the primary database include   Yahoo  for web user behavioral analysis  storing two petabytes and claimed to be the largest data warehouse using a heavily modified version of PostgreSQL with an entirely different column based storage engine and different query processing layer  While for performance  storage  and query purposes the database bears little resemblance to PostgreSQL  the front end maintains compatibility so that Yahoo can use many off the shelf tools already written to interact with PostgreSQL   In 2009  social networking website MySpace used Aster Data Systems s nCluster database for data warehousing  which was built on unmodified PostgreSQL   State Farm uses PostgreSQL on their Aster Data Systems s nCluster Analytics server   Geni com uses PostgreSQL for their main genealogy database   OpenStreetMap  a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world

PostgreSQL is offered by some major vendors as software as a service   Heroku  a platform as a service provider  has supported PostgreSQL since the start in 2007  They offer value add features like full database  roll back   ability to restore a database from any point in time   which is based on WAL E  open source software developed by Heroku   In January 2012  EnterpriseDB released a cloud version of both PostgreSQL and their own proprietary Postgres Plus Advanced Server with automated provisioning for failover  replication  load balancing  and scaling  It runs on Amazon Web Services   VMware offers vFabric Postgres for private clouds on vSphere since May 2012   In November 2013  Amazon com announced that they are adding PostgreSQL to their Relational Database Service offering   13  Proprietary derivatives and support  Although the license allowed proprietary products based on Postgres  the code did not develop in the proprietary space at first  The first main offshoot originated when Paula Hawthorn  an original Ingres team member who moved from Ingres  and Michael Stonebraker formed Illustra Information Technologies to make a proprietary product based on Postgres   In 2000  former Red Hat investors created the company Great Bridge to make a proprietary product based on PostgreSQL and compete against proprietary database vendors  Great Bridge sponsored several PostgreSQL developers and donated many resources back to the community  but by late 2001 closed due to tough competition from companies like Red Hat and to poor market conditions   In 2001 Command Prompt  Inc  released Mammoth PostgreSQL  a proprietary product based on PostgreSQL  In 2008 Command Prompt  Inc  released the source under the original license  Command Prompt  Inc  continues to support the PostgreSQL community actively through developer sponsorships and projects including PL Perl  PL php  and hosting of community projects such as the PostgreSQL build farm   In January 2005  PostgreSQL received backing by database vendor Pervasive Software  known for its Btrieve product which was ubiquitous on the Novell NetWare platform  Pervasive announced commercial support and community participation and achieved some success  In July 2006  Pervasive left the PostgreSQL support market   In mid 2005 two other companies announced plans to make proprietary products based on PostgreSQL with focus on separate niche markets  EnterpriseDB added functionality to allow applications written to work with Oracle to be more readily run with PostgreSQL  Greenplum contributed enhancements directed at data warehouse and business intelligence applications  including the BizGres project   In October 2005 John Loiacono  executive vice president of software at Sun Microsystems  commented   We re not going to OEM Microsoft but we are looking at PostgreSQL right now   although no specifics were released at that time  By November 2005 Sun had announced support for PostgreSQL  By June 2006 Sun Solaris 10  6 06 release  shipped with PostgreSQL   In August 2007  EnterpriseDB announced EnterpriseDB Postgres  a pre configured distribution of PostgreSQL including many contrib modules and add on components  EnterpriseDB Postgres was renamed to Postgres Plus in March 2008  Postgres Plus is available in two versions  Postgres Plus Solution Pack  comprising PostgreSQL delivered in a GUI one click install plus Solution Pack components that include  Postgres Enterprise Manager  Update Monitor  xDB Replication Server  SQL Profiler  SQL Protect  Migration Toolkit and PL Secure   and Postgres Plus Advanced Server which has all the features of Postgres Plus Solutions Pack plus Oracle compatibility  performance features not available in PostgreSQL  as well as advanced security features not available in PostgreSQL  Both versions are available for download at no cost and are fully supported  The Solution Pack components and Advanced Server are restricted by a  limited use  license for evaluation purposes only unless purchased though a subscription  In 2011  EnterpriseDB announced Postgres Plus Cloud Database  which easily provisions PostgreSQL and Postgres Plus Advanced Server databases  with Oracle compatibility  in single instances  high availability clusters  or development sandboxes for Database as a Service environments   In 2011  2ndQuadrant became a Platinum Sponsor of PostgreSQL  in recognition of their long standing contributions and developer sponsorship  2ndQuadrant employ one of the largest teams of PostgreSQL contributors and provide professional support for open source PostgreSQL   Many other companies have used PostgreSQL as the base for their proprietary database projects  e g  Truviso  Netezza  ParAccel  In many cases the products have been enhanced so much that the software has been forked  though with some features cherry picked from later releases   14  Release history  15  See also  Comparison of relational database management
