The Radio Shack TRS 80 Color Computer  also marketed as the Tandy Color Computer and affectionately nicknamed CoCo  is a line of home computers based on the Motorola 6809 processor  The Color Computer was launched in 1980 and lasted through three generations of hardware until being discontinued in 1991   1  Summary  Despite bearing the TRS 80 name  the  Color Computer  is a radical departure from the earlier TRS 80  in particular it has a Motorola 6809E processor  rather than the TRS 80 s Zilog Z80  Thus  despite the similar name  the new machine is not compatible with software made for the old TRS 80   The Motorola 6809E was an advanced processor for the time  but was correspondingly more expensive than other  more popular  microprocessors  Competing machines such as the Apple II  Commodore VIC 20  the Commodore 64  the Atari 400  and the Atari 800 were designed around the much cheaper MOS 6502  Some of these computers were paired with dedicated sound and graphics chips and were much more commercially successful in the 1980s home computer market   The Tandy Color Computer line started in 1980 with what is now called the CoCo 1 and ended in 1991 with the more powerful  yet similar CoCo 3  All three CoCo models maintained a high level of software and hardware compatibility  with few programs written for the older model not running on the newer ones  The death knell of the CoCo was the advent of lower cost IBM PC clones   2  Origin and history  The TRS 80 Color Computer started out as a joint venture between Tandy Corporation of Fort Worth  Texas and Motorola Semiconductor  Inc  of Austin  to develop a low cost home computer in 1977   The initial goal of this project  called  Green Thumb   was to create a low cost Videotex terminal for farmers  ranchers  and others in the agricultural industry  This terminal would connect to a phone line and an ordinary color television and allow the user access to near real time information useful to their day to day operations on the farm   Motorola s MC6847 Video Display Generator  VDG  chip was released about the same time as the joint venture started and it has been speculated that the VDG was actually designed for this project  At the core of the prototype  Green Thumb  terminal  the MC6847  along with the MC6809 microprocessor unit  MPU   made the prototype a reality by about 1978  Unfortunately  the prototype contained too many chips to be commercially viable  Motorola solved this problem by integrating all the functions of the many smaller chips into one chip  the MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer  SAM   By that time in late 1979  the new and powerful Motorola MC6809 processor was released  The SAM  VDG  and 6809 were combined and the AgVision terminal was born   The AgVision terminal was also sold through Radio Shack stores as the VideoTex terminal around 1980  Internal differences  if any  are unclear  as not many AgVision terminals survive to this day   With its proven design  the VideoTex terminal contains all the basic components for a general purpose home computer  The internal modem was removed  and I O ports for cassette storage  serial I O  and joysticks were provided  An expansion connector was added to the right side of the case for future enhancements and program cartridges   Program Paks    and a RAM button  a sticker indicating the amount of installed memory in the machine  covers the hole where the Modem s LED  DATA  indicator had been  On July 31  1980  Tandy announced the TRS 80 Color Computer  Sharing the same case  keyboard  and layout as the AgVision VideoTex terminals  at first glance it would be hard to tell the TRS 80 Color Computer from its predecessors   The initial model  catalog number 26 3001  shipped with 4 kB of Dynamic Random Access Memory  DRAM  and an interpreter in ROM  Its price was Within a few months  Radio Shack stores across the US and Canada began receiving and selling the new computer   3  Differences from earlier TRS 80 models  The Color Computer  with its Motorola 6809E processor  is a radical departure from the Z80 based TRS 80 models  BYTE wrote that  The only similarity between  the two computers  is the name   Indeed the  80  in  TRS 80  stands for  Z80   For a time  the CoCo was referred to internally as the TRS 90 in reference to the  9  in  6809   However  this was dropped and all CoCos sold as Radio Shack computers were called TRS 80 in spite of the processor change   Like its Z80 based predecessors  the CoCo shipped with BASIC  but in this case Tandy licensed Microsoft BASIC  As with the Z80 systems  there were multiple levels of BASIC  In the case of the CoCo they were the standard Color BASIC and Extended Color BASIC  Beyond that  Disk Extended Color BASIC came with the floppy controller  and on the CoCo 3  Super Extended Color BASIC extensions were added by Microware  Additional ROMs such as JDOS  Copyright J&M Systems  were available to enable the use of double sided disk drives   The CoCo was designed to be attached to a color television set  whereas the Z80 machines use monochrome computer monitors  often built into the case  The CoCo also features an expansion connector for program cartridges  mostly games  and other expansion devices  such as floppy disk controllers and modems  In this way it shared some similarity to the Atari 2600  Atari 8 bit computers and other cartridge capable systems  Tandy released a Multi Pak Interface which allowed switching quickly among four cartridges  This was similar in concept to the Model I s Expansion Interface   Unlike some Z80 models  the CoCo did not come with a built in floppy drive  The CoCo was designed to save and load programs and data from a standard audio cassette deck  Tandy eventually offered a floppy disk drive controller for the CoCo as a cartridge  Both the CoCo and earlier TRS 80s shared the WD17xx series floppy disk controllers and 35   later 40   track industry standard floppy drives   Even with the add on floppy drive  the CoCo did not have a true DOS until third party operating systems such as TSC FLEX9  distributed for the CoCo by Frank Hogg Laboratories  and Microware s multi user  multi tasking OS 9 were available  However  a disk based CoCo did contain Disk Extended Color BASIC on an internal ROM in the controller cartridge that gave the BASIC user the ability to save and load programs from the disk and store and retrieve data from disk in various ways   Some non program expansion cartridges included a sound voice synthesizer  which led to the CoCo being used as an accessibility device for the disabled    300 baud modem pack  RS232 pack  a hard drive controller  stereo music adapter  floppy disk controller  input tablet  and other accessories  The CoCo was the first Tandy computer to have a mouse available for it   4  Versions  There were three versions of the Color Computer   4 1  Color Computer 1  1980–1983   The original version of the Color Computer shipped in a large silver gray case with a calculator like  chiclet keyboard   and was available with memory sizes of 4K  26 3001   16K  26 3002   or 32K  26 3003   Versions with at least 16K of memory installed shipped with standard Microsoft Color Basic or  optionally  Extended Color Basic  It used a regular TV for display  and TV out was the only available connection to a display device   The early versions of the CoCo 1 had a black keyboard surround  the TRS 80 nameplate above the keyboard to the left side  and a RAM badge   button   affixed on the top and right side of the case  Later versions removed the black keyboard surround and RAM button  and moved the TRS 80 nameplate to the mid line of the case   The computer was based on a single printed circuit board  with all semiconductors manufactured by Motorola including the MC6809E CPU  MC6847 VDG  MC6883 SAM  and RAM  Initial versions of the CoCo were upgraded to 32K by means of piggybacking two banks of 16K memory chips and adding a few jumper wires  A later motherboard revision removed the 4K RAM option and were upgraded to 32K with  half bad  64K memory chips as a cost cutting measure  These boards have jumpers marked HIGH LOW to determine which half of the memory chip was good  This was transparent to the BASIC programmer since in either configuration 32K of memory was available  As memory production yields improved and costs went down  many  perhaps most  32K CoCo 1s were shipped with perfectly good 64K memory chips  many utilities and programs began to take advantage of the  hidden  32K   Users opening the case risked invalidating the warranty  Radio Shack could upgrade all versions that shipped with standard Color BASIC to Extended Color BASIC  developed by Microsoft  for $99  BYTE wrote in 1981 that through Extended Color BASIC  Radio Shack  has released the first truly easy to use and inexpensive system that generates full color graphics   Eventually the 32K memory option was dropped entirely and only 16K or 64K versions were offered   In late 1982 a version of the Color Computer with a white case  called the TDP System 100  was distributed by RCA and sold through non Tandy stores  Except for the nameplate and case  it was identical to the Color Computer   At some point after this  both the Coco and the TDP System 100 shipped with a white case which had ventilation slots that ran the entire length of the case  rather than only on the sides  This ventilation scheme was carried over to the CoCo 2  Some late versions of the CoCo also shipped with a modified keyboard  often referred to as the  melted  keyboard  which had bigger keycaps but a similar rubbery feel   A number of peripherals were available  tape cassette storage  serial printers  a 5 25 inch floppy disk drive  a pen and graphics tablet called the  X Pad   speech and sound generators  and joysticks   4 2  Color Computer 2  1983–1986   During the initial CoCo 1 production run  much of the discrete support circuitry had been re engineered into a handful of custom integrated circuits  leaving much of the circuit board area of the CoCo 1 as empty space  To cut production costs  the case was shortened by about 25% and a new  smaller power supply and motherboard were designed  The  melted  keyboard from the white CoCo 1 and the TDP 100 style ventilation slots were carried over  Aside from the new look and the deletion of the 12 volt power supply to the expansion connector  the computer was essentially 100% compatible with the previous generation  The deletion of the 12 volt power supply crippled some peripherals such as the original floppy disk controller  which then needed to be upgraded  installed in a Multi Pak interface  or supplied with external power   Production was also partially moved to Korea during the CoCo 2 s life span  and many owners of the Korean built systems referred to them as  KoKos   Production in the USA and Korea happened in parallel using the same part numbers  very few  if any  differences exist between the USA built and Korean built CoCo 2 machines   Upgraded BASIC ROMs were also produced  adding a few minor features and correcting some bugs  A redesigned 5 volt disk controller was introduced with its own new Disk BASIC ROM  v1 1   This controller added the  DOS  command which was used to boot the OS 9 operating system by Microware   Later in the production run  the  melted  keyboard was replaced with a new  full travel  typewriter style keyboard   The final significant change in the life of the CoCo 2 was made for the models 26 3134B  26 3136B  and 26 3127B  16 kB standard  16 kB extended  and 64 kB extended respectively   Internally this model was redesigned to use the enhanced VDG  the MC6847T1  This enhanced VDG allowed the use of lower case characters and the ability to change the text screen border color  For compatibility reasons neither of these features were used and were not enabled in BASIC  however the resourceful user could enable them by setting certain memory registers  Midway during the production run of these final CoCo 2s  the nameplate was changed from  Radio Shack TRS 80 Color Computer 2  to  Tandy Color Computer 2   The red  green  and blue shapes were replaced with red  green  and blue parallelograms   4 3  Color Computer 3  1986–1991   On July 30  1986  Tandy announced the Color Computer 3 at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City  It came with which could be upgraded to 512 kB  The keyboard surround and cartridge door plastic were changed from black to grey  The keyboard layout was revised  putting the arrow keys in a diamond configuration and adding CTRL  ALT  F1 and F2 keys  It sold in Radio Shack stores and Tandy Computer Centers for $219 95  199 CAD in Canada later that year    The CoCo 3 was compatible with most older software and CoCo 2 peripherals  Taking the place of the graphics and memory hardware in the CoCo 1 and 2 was an application specific integrated circuit called the  GIME   Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancement  chip  The GIME also provided additional features   Output to a composite video monitor or analog RGB monitor  in addition to the CoCo 1 and 2 s TV output  This did much to improve the clarity of its output   A paged memory management unit broke up the 6809 s 64 kB address space into chunks  Although these chunks were considered to be too large by many programmers  the scheme would later allow third party RAM upgrades of up to 2 MB      Text display with real lowercase at 32  40  64  or 80 characters per line and between 16 and 24 lines per screen   Text character attributes  including 8 foreground and 8 background colors  underline  and blink   New graphics resolutions of 160  256  320 or 640 pixels wide by 192 to 225 lines   Up to 16 simultaneous colors from a palette of 64  Omitted from the GIME were the seldom used SAM created Semigraphics 8  12  and 24 modes  A rumored 256 color mode  detailed in the original Tandy spec for the GIME  has never been found   Previous versions of the CoCo ROM had been licensed from Microsoft  but by this time Microsoft was not interested in extending the code further  Instead  Microware provided extensions to Extended Color BASIC to support the new display modes  In order to not violate the spirit of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and Tandy  Microsoft s unmodified BASIC software was loaded in the CoCo 3 s ROM  Upon startup  the ROM is copied to RAM and then patched by Microware s code  Although this was a clever way of adding features to BASIC  it was not without some flaws  the patched code had several bugs  and support for many of the new hardware features was incomplete   Microware also provided a version of the OS 9 Level 2 operating system shortly after launch  This OS featured memory mapping  so each process had its own memory space up to 64K   windowed display  and a more extensive development environment that included a bundled copy of BASIC09  C and Pascal compilers were available  Various members of the CoCo OS 9 community enhanced OS 9 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 at Tandy s request  but Tandy stopped production of the CoCo 3 before the upgrade was officially released  Most of the improvements made it into NitrOS 9  a major rewrite of OS 9 6809 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 to take advantage of the added features and speed of the Hitachi 6309  if the unit has the Hitachi CPU installed    The 6809 in the CoCo 1 and 2 ran at 0 895 MHz  the CoCo 3 runs at that frequency by default  but is software controllable to run at twice that rate  OS 9 takes advantage of that capability   A popular accessory was a high resolution joystick adapter designed by CoCo enthusiast Steve Bjork  While it did increase the resolution of the joystick mouse interface by a factor of ten  it did so at the expense of CPU time  A modified version of this interface was included with a software package by Colorware called CoCo Max 3  by Dave Stamp  This was a MacPaint work alike but added support for color graphics  This was a very desirable product for CoCo owners and combined with a MacWrite like word processor called MAX 10  also by Dave Stamp and internally named  MaxWrite    provided some of the functionality of an Apple Macintosh  but with color graphics and at a fraction of the cost   While the CoCo 3 featured many enhancements and was well received  it was not without problems and disappointments  As initially conceived  the CoCo 3 had much hardware acceleration and enhanced sound  However  internal politics crippled the design so it would not be perceived as a threat to the Tandy 1000  This again limited the platform s potential as a game console  Early versions of the GIME had DRAM timing issues which caused random freezes  Due to bugs in the GIME some features that were problematic were marked as  reserved  or  do not use  in the programming and service manuals   The power supply was marginal  and some would overheat if the system memory was expanded to the full capacity due to the considerable heat generated by the additional static RAM on the optional daughterboard  Some CoCo 3 owners opted to add a small fan inside the case to keep it cool   5  Prototypes and rare versions  Various prototypes for the CoCo have surfaced over the years  In the 1980s  Radio Shack stores were selling a keyboard that would plug directly into a CoCo 2  though not labeled as such  This keyboard was part of a production run for the never produced Deluxe Color Computer  The Deluxe CoCo was referenced in CoCo manual sets and specifically mentioned as having extra keys  lowercase video  and the ability to accept commands in lowercase  Later versions of the CoCo 2  labeled Tandy instead of TRS 80  had the ability to display true lowercase  but did not accept lowercase commands  although this capability was later available through A DOS  a third party replacement ROM for the Disk Controller   Production model CoCo 3s have been found with different circuit board layouts and socketed chips  In 2005  a rare CoCo 3 prototype surfaced at the Chicago CoCoFEST  with a built in floppy disk drive controller and other items still not identified  It also did not use a GIME chip  Instead  all the functionality of the GIME was created using separate chips  There is a hobbyist effort to try to reverse engineer these chips so a modern GIME can finally be produced   There is also a prototype Ethernet interface for the Color Computer  displaying a board layout date of 1984  and a few other mystery boards that have yet to be examined  There is some evidence that Tandy killed the Ethernet interface at the last minute  an ad mentioning the networking options for some of Tandy s Z80 based computers claimed that the Color Computer would soon have networking capabilities  and the printed manual for an upgraded version of OS 9 Level One listed networking in the table of contents  but had no corresponding text in the body of the manual   6  CoCo clones and cousins  The Dragon 32 and 64 computers were British cousins of the CoCo based on a reference design from Motorola that was produced as an exemplar of the capabilities of the MC6809E  MPU  when coupled with the MC6847  Video Display Generator   VDG  and the MC6883  Synchronous Address Multiplexer   SAM   The BIOS code for the Dragon 32 was rewritten based on specifications and API drawn up by Microsoft and  to a certain extent  PA Consulting of Cambridge  The Dragon was a much improved unit with video output in addition to the TV output of the CoCo and CoCo 2  It also featured a Centronics parallel port  not present on any CoCo   an integrated 6551A serial UART  on the Dragon 64   and a higher quality keyboard  In 1983  a version of the Dragon was licensed for manufacture for the North American market by Tano Corporation of New Orleans  Louisiana  Tano started production at their facility in September 83 and were running at capacity just one month later  Unfortunately sales weren t as good as expected and Tano stopped production and support just one year later  A California surplus equipment company  California Digital  bought the remaining stock of Tano built Dragon 64 shortly after and has had new in the box Dragon 64s available for purchase as of December 2009   In Brazil  there existed several CoCo clones  including the Prologica CP400 Color and CP400 Color II  the Varixx VC50  the LZ Color64  the Dynacom MX1600  the Codimex CD6809 and the  vaporware  Microdigital TKS800   In Mexico  the Micro SEP  a CoCo 2 clone with 64 kB of memory  was introduced by the Secretary of Education  The Micro SEP was intended to be distributed nationally to all the public schools teaching the 7th to 9th grades  They were presented as a design of the Center of Advanced Research and Studies  CINVESTAV  of the National Polytechnic Institute  IPN   Like the Dragon  these computers also included video output  Whether these computers were  designed  by this institute  or were licensed from the original design  is unclear   A Taiwan based company  Sampo  also made a CoCo clone  the Sampo Color Computer  The Sampo was supposedly available in Taiwan  Korea  and possibly other Asian countries  It is believed that Tandy blocked sales in the US with legal action due to copyright infringements on the ROM code   A cousin of the CoCo  The MC 10  or Micro Color Computer  was sold in Radio Shack stores as a lower cost  more entry level computer than the CoCo  Released in 1983  it was similar in appearance to the Timex Sinclair  It also used the MC6847 VDG and Microsoft Basic  but featured the MC6803 instead of the 6809  It was just as bare bones as the little Timex Sinclair model as well  lacking such things as an 80 column printer and disk storage system  as well as a  real  keyboard  Accordingly  it did not sell well and was withdrawn after just two years of production  An MC 10 clone  the Sysdata Tcolor  was available in Brazil with 16 kB ROM   7  Hardware design and integrated circuits  Internally the CoCo 1 and CoCo 2 models are functionally identical  The core of the system is virtually identical to the reference design included in the Motorola MC6883 data sheet and consists of five LSI chips   MC6809E Microprocessor Unit  MPU   MC6883 SN74LS783 SN74LS785 Synchronous Address Multiplexor  SAM   MC6847 Video Display Generator  VDG   Two Peripheral Interface Adapters  PIA   either MC6821 or MC6822 chips  7 1  SAM  The SAM is a multifunction device that performs the following functions   Clock generation and synchronization for the 6809E MPU and 6847 VDG  Up to 64K Dynamic Random Access Memory  DRAM  control and refresh  Device selection based on MPU memory address to determine if the MPU access is to DRAM  ROM  PIA  etc   Duplication of the VDG address counter to  feed  the VDG the data it is expecting The SAM was designed to replace numerous small LS TTL chips into one integrated package  Its main purpose is to control the DRAM but  as outlined above  it integrates several other functions as well  It is connected to a crystal at 4 times the television colorburst frequency  14 31818 MHz for NTSC countries   This is divided by 4 internally and is fed to the VDG for its own internal timing  3 579545 MHz for NTSC   The SAM also divides the master clock by 16  or 8 in certain cases  for the two phase MPU clock  in NTSC this is  89 MHz  or 1 8 MHz if divided by 8    Switching the SAM into 1 8 MHz operation gives the CPU the time ordinarily used by the VDG and refresh  As such  the display shows garbage  this mode was seldom used  However  an unusual mode available by the SAM is called the Address Dependent mode  where ROM reads  since they do not use the DRAM  occur at 1 8 MHz but regular RAM access occurs at  89 MHz  In effect  since the BASIC interpreter runs from ROM  putting the machine in this mode would nearly double the performance of a BASIC program while maintaining video display and DRAM refresh  Of course  this would throw off the software timing loops and I O operations would be affected  Despite this  however  the  high speed POKE  was used by many CoCo BASIC programs even though it overclocked the hardware in the CoCo  which was only rated for 1 MHz operation   The SAM has no connection to the MPU data bus  As such  it is programmed in a curious manner  its 16 bit configuration register is spread across 32 memory addresses  FFC0 FFDF   Writing even bytes sets that register bit to 0  Writing to odd bytes sets it to 1   Due to limitations in 40 pin packaging  the SAM contains a duplicate of the VDG s internal 12 bit address counter  Normally this counter s settings are set to duplicate the VDG s display mode  However  this is not required and results in the creation of some new display modes not possible when the VDG is used in a system alone  Instead of the VDG requesting data from RAM by itself  the VDG is  fed  data by the SAM s internal copy of the VDG address counter  This process is called  Interleaved Direct Memory Access   IDMA  by Motorola and ensures that the processor and VDG always have full access to this shared memory resource with no wait states or contention   There are two versions of the SAM  The early one is labeled MC6883 and or SN74LS783  the later version is labeled SN74LS785  There are some minor timing differences  but the major difference is the support of an 8 bit refresh counter in the 785 version  This allowed for use of inexpensive 16K by 4 bit and certain 64K by 1 bit DRAMs  Some third party bank switching memory upgrades that used 256K DRAMs needed this 8 bit refresh counter to work   7 2  VDG  The MC6847 is display generator capable of displaying text and graphics contained within a roughly square display matrix 256 pixels wide by 192 lines high  It can display 9 colors  black  green  yellow  blue  red  buff  almost but not quite white   cyan  magenta  and orange   7 2 1  Alphanumeric Semigraphics display  The CoCo is physically wired such that its default alphanumeric display is actually  Semigraphics 4  mode   In alphanumeric mode  each character is a 5 dot wide by 7 dot high character in a box 8 dots wide and 12 lines high  This display mode consumes 512 bytes of memory and is a 32 character wide screen with 16 lines  The internal ROM character generator only holds 64 characters  so no lower case characters are provided  Lower case characters were rendered as upper case characters with inverted color  Although simulated screen shots would show this as green on black  on most CoCo generations it was actually green on very dark green   Semigraphics is a hybrid display mode where alphanumerics and chunky block graphics can be mixed together on the same screen  If the 8th bit of the character is set  it is a semigraphics character  If cleared  it is an alphanumeric  When the 8th bit is set  the next three bits determine the color and last 4 bits determine which  quadrant  of the character box is either the selected color or black  This is the only mode where it is possible  without sneaky tricks  to display all 9 colors on the screen simultaneously  If used to only display semigraphics  the screen becomes a 64×32 9 color graphics mode  The CoCo features several BASIC commands to manage this screen as a low res graphics display   The alphanumeric display has two colorsets  The one used by default on the CoCo has black characters on a green background  The alternate has black characters on an orange background  The colorset selection does not affect semigraphics characters  The border in this mode is always black   The 6847 is capable of a Semigraphics 6 display mode  where two bits select a color and 6 bits determine which 1 6 of the character box is lit  In this mode only 4 colors are possible but the Colorset bit of the VDG can select two different groups of the 4 colors     7 2 2  Additional Semigraphics modes  By setting the SAM such that it believes it is displaying a full graphics mode  but leaving the VDG in Alphanumeric Semigraphics 4 mode  it is possible to subdivide the character box into smaller pieces  This creates the  virtual  modes Semigraphics 8  12  and 24  In these modes it was possible to mix bits and pieces of different text characters as well as Semigraphics 4 characters  These modes were an interesting curiosity but not widely used  as the Semigraphics 24 screen consumed 6144 bytes of memory  These modes were not implemented on the CoCo 3   A programmer s reference manual for the CoCo states that due to a fire at Tandy s research lab  the papers relating to the semigraphics modes were shuffled  and so some of the semigraphics modes were never documented  CoCo enthusiasts created experimental programs to try to reverse engineer the modes  and were able to reconstruct the missing documentation   7 2 3  Graphics display  There were several full graphics display modes  which were divided into two categories   resolution  graphics and  color  graphics  In resolution modes  each pixel is addressable as either on or off  There are two colorsets available  the first was black dots on a green background and green border  the second  more commonly used one has white dots on a black background with a white border  In color modes  each pixel was two bits  selecting one of four colors  Again the colorset input to the VDG determined which colors were used  The first colorset has a green border  and the colors green  yellow  red  and blue were available  The second colorset has a white border and the colors white  cyan  magenta and orange were available  Resolution graphics have 8 pixels per byte and are available in 128×64  128×96  128×192  and 256×192 densities  Color graphics have 4 pixels per byte and are available in 64×64  128×64  128×96  and 128×192 densities  The maximum size of a graphics screen is 6144 bytes   7 2 4  Artifact colors  The 256×192 two color graphics mode uses four colors due to a quirk in the NTSC television system  see composite artifact colors   It is not possible to reliably display 256 dots across the screen due to the limitations of the NTSC signal and the phase relationship between the VDG clock and colorburst frequency   In the first colorset  where green and black dots are available  alternating columns of green and black are not distinct and appear as a muddy green color  However  when one switches to the white and black colorset  instead of a muddy gray as expected  the result is either orange or blue  Reversing the order of the alternating dots will give the opposite color  In effect this mode becomes a 128×192 4 color graphics mode where black  orange  blue  and white are available  the Apple II created color graphics by exploiting a similar effect    Most CoCo games used this mode as the colors available are more useful than the ones provided in the hardware 4 color modes  Unfortunately the VDG internally can power up on either the rising or falling edge of the clock  so the bit patterns that represent orange and blue are not predictable  Most CoCo games would start up with a title screen and invited the user to press the reset button until the colors were correct  The CoCo 3 fixed the clock edge problem so it was always the same  a user would hold the F1 key during reset to choose the other color set   On a CoCo 3 with an analog RGB monitor  the black and white dot patterns do not artifact  to see them one would have to use a TV or composite monitor  or patch the games to use the hardware 128×192 four color mode in which the GIME chip allows the color choices to be mapped  Users in PAL countries saw green and purple stripes instead of solid red and blue colors   Readers of The Rainbow or Hot CoCo magazine learned that they could use some POKE commands to switch the 6847 VDG into one of the artifact modes  while Extended Color Basic continued to operate as though it were still displaying one of the 128×192 four color modes  Thus  the entire set of Extended Color Basic graphics commands could be used with the artifact colors  Some users went on to develop a set of 16 artifact colors using a 4×2 pixel matrix  giving this set of colors  black  dark cyan  brick red  light violet  dark blue  azure  the blue above   olive green  brown  purple  light blue  orange  yellow  light gray  blue white  pink white  and white  Use of POKE commands also made these colors available to the graphics commands  although the colors had to be drawn one horizontal line at a time  Some interesting artworks were produced from these effects  especially since the CoCo Max art package provided them in its palette of colors   7 2 5  Lower case and the 6847T1  The 6847 is capable of using an external character generator  Several third party add on adapter boards would allow the CoCo to display real lowercase characters   Very late in the CoCo 2 production run  an enhanced VDG was available  Called the 6847T1  it included a lower case character generator and the ability to display a green orange or black border on the text screen  Its other changes were mainly to reduce parts count by incorporating an internal data latch  The lower case capability of this VDG is not enabled by default on this system and is not even mentioned in the manual  Only through some tinkering and research was this feature discovered by intrepid CoCo users   The 6847T1 may also carry the part number XC80652P  these may have been pre release parts   7 3  PIAs  There are two PIA chips in all CoCo models  The PIAs are dedicated mainly to I O operations such as driving the internal 6 bit Digital to analog converter  DAC   reading the status of the DAC s voltage comparator  controlling the relay for the cassette motor  reading the keyboard matrix  controlling the VDG mode control pins  reading and writing to the RS232 serial I O port  and controlling the internal analog multiplexers   The earliest CoCo models had two standard 6821 chips  Later  due to changes in the keyboard design  it was found that the 6822 IIA  industrial interface adapter  was better suited to the keyboard s impedance  The 6822 was eventually discontinued by Motorola but was produced for Tandy as an ASIC with a special Tandy part number  SC67331P  Functionally the 6821 and 6822 are identical and one can put a 6821 in place of the 6822 if that part is bad  Some external pull up resistors may be needed to use a 6821 to replace a 6822 in a CoCo for normal keyboard operation   7 4  Interface to external peripherals  Due to the CoCo s design  the MPU encounters no wait states in normal operation  This means that precise software controlled timing loops are easily implemented  This is important  since the CoCo has no specialized hardware for any I O  All I O operations  such as cassette reading and writing  serial I O  scanning the keyboard  and reading the position of the joysticks  must be done entirely in software  This reduces hardware cost  but reduces system performance as the MPU is unavailable during these operations   As an example  the CoCo cassette interface is perhaps one of the fastest available  1500 bit s  but it does so entirely under software control  While reading or writing a cassette the CoCo has no CPU time free for other tasks  They must wait until an error occurs or all the data needed is read   The precise timing loops made the CoCo useful for laboratory purposes  Since it has no operating system servicing interrupts  it can do precisely timed read modify write operations for scientific instrumentation  at a speed that cannot be matched by even the newest computers running Microsoft Windows without disabling the Windows operating system   8  CoCo 3 hardware changes  The hardware in the CoCo 1 and CoCo 2 models was functionally the same  the only differences were in packaging and integration of some functions into small ASICs  The CoCo 3 radically changed this  A new VLSI ASIC  called  officially  the Advanced Color Video Chip  ACVC  or  unofficially  the Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancer  GIME   integrated the functions of the SAM and VDG while enhancing the capabilities of both  Aside from the graphics enhancements outlined above  the CoCo 3 offered true lower case  40 and 80 column text display capability  and the ability to run at 1 8 MHz without loss of video display  As such the processor was changed to the 68B09E and the PIA was changed to the 68B21  which are 2 MHz rated parts   9  Competition  The CoCo s main competition was from the Commodore VIC 20  Commodore 64  Apple II  and the Atari 400 and Atari 800   While the CoCo sported perhaps the most advanced 8 bit processor ever made  that processing power came at a significant price premium  In order to sell the CoCo at a competitive price  its relatively expensive processor was not tied to any specialized video or sound hardware  In comparison  the 6502 derived processor in the Commodore  Apple and Atari systems was much less expensive  Both Commodore and Atari had invested in advanced graphics and sound chip design for arcade games and home gaming consoles  By tying these specialized circuits with an inexpensive processor  Atari and Commodore systems were able to play sophisticated games with high quality graphics and sound  The trade off is between a system with an expensive CPU that does a lot of work  or an inexpensive CPU that controls the registers of its sound and video hardware   The CoCo video hardware was derived from a chip designed as display for a character based terminal  and is a completely  dumb  device  Similarly  the sound hardware is little more than a 6 bit DAC under software control  All graphics and sound require direct CPU intervention  and while this allows for great flexibility  its performance is much lower than dedicated hardware   Games drove system sales then as they do now  and with its poor gaming performance  the CoCo attracted little interest in officially licensed ports of popular games  The CoCo 3 did improve graphics capability and doubled CPU performance  but still contained no hardware graphics or sound acceleration  Drawing was performed by the CPU  and most of the new graphics modes required at least twice as much processor time due to increased display resolution and color depth  The sound hardware was not changed at all   Every computer platform is a compromise  and despite the significant graphics and sound handicap the CoCo may have had  it still had a sophisticated CPU under its hood with extremely high performance  There were many independent clones of popular games available  but far more important was the availability of  killer apps  for the CoCo  For instance  CoCo Max and Max 10 were clones of MacPaint and MacWrite  The OS 9 operating system  a UNIX like multi tasking multi user environment  was also available  Even the BASIC interpreter was one of the most powerful available  and provided the user with a rich set of easy to use commands for manipulating on screen graphics and playing sounds   Some of the hardware limitations were overcome with external add ons  particularly expansion cartridges  Some were made by Tandy  some by other manufacturers  Examples are   RS232 Program Pak  which provided a real RS232 UART for serial communications  the 6551A   The Speech & Sound Pak  which provided a speech synthesizer and a sound generator chip  Word Pak and Word Pak II 80 column display adapters produced by PBJ  Inc  allowed connection to an external monochrome monitor  not needed for CoCo 3    300 baud modem pak  Advanced floppy and hard drive controllers  mostly for OS 9  Key to taking advantage of these expansion capabilities is the Multi Pak interface  which permits up to four devices such as these to be attached to the system at the same time   10  The OS 9 divide  There is a major division of CoCo users  those who used the OS 9 operating system and those who used Disk Extended Color BASIC  DECB   The divide comes from the fact that programs using DECB  except for those that used CoCo s form of BASIC  used DECB only as a loader and for disk I O  communicating with the hardware directly for all other activities  OS 9 applications communicate with OS 9 and its drivers  This allows for a degree of hardware independence   Many programs written for the CoCo were DECB programs  In order to support such programs  or at least  those that bypassed BASIC and addressed hardware directly   any future CoCo version would have to be hardware compatible with the CoCo  or perfectly emulate every aspect of the CoCo  In contrast  OS 9 programs relied only on OS 9 functions  and its drivers could be rewritten to work with different hardware  However  DECB came with the CoCo system itself  and required no further setup or purchasing  OS 9 was an additional product that had to be loaded manually each time the computer was started  Writing an OS 9 program meant appealing to a smaller subset of the CoCo community  this discouraged development of OS 9 products   11  The end of the road  On October 26  1990  Ed Juge of Tandy announced that the CoCo 3 would be dropped from its computer line  With no apparent successor mentioned  the announcement was disheartening to many loyal CoCo fans   Even today  current and former CoCo owners agree that Tandy did not take the CoCo very seriously  despite it having been their best selling computer for several years  Tandy failed to market the CoCo as the powerful and useful machine that it was  and offered customers no hint about the large number of third party software and hardware products available for it   The release of the CoCo 3 was particularly lackluster despite its greatly enhanced graphic capabilities and RGB monitor support  Radio Shack fliers and stores typically depicted the CoCo 3 running CoCo 2 games  and offered a very limited selection of CoCo 3 specific software  There was an official Radio Shack store demo  but few stores bothered to run it  In addition  Tandy released the CoCo 3 well after the release of the Amiga  and the weaker hardware meant the bouncing ball demo was unflattering in comparison to the Amiga s   Additionally  DRAM prices skyrocketed at the time the CoCo 3 was released  making the 512 kB memory upgrade considerably more expensive than the 128K CoCo 3 itself  Very few stores displayed a 512K machine or a CoCo 3 running such games as King s Quest or Leisure Suit Larry   12  Successors  In spite of Tandy s apparent lack of concern for the CoCo market  there were rumors of the existence of a prototype at Tandy s Fort Worth headquarters  Several first hand accounts of the prototype came from people like Mark Siegel of Tandy and Ken Kaplan of Microware  yet there exists no known physical evidence of such a machine   A few independent companies attempted to carry the CoCo torch  but the lack of decent backwards compatibility with the failed to entice much of the CoCo community over to these new independent platforms  Many of these independent platforms did run OS9 68k  which was very similar to OS 9  However the bulk of the CoCo community moved on to more mainstream platforms  Some CoCo users swore their loyalty to Motorola and moved on to the Amiga  Atari ST  and the Macintosh  all of which were based on the Motorola 68000 processor  Others jumped to the IBM PC compatible   12 1  Tomcat  Frank Hogg Labs introduced the Tomcat TC 9 in June 1990  which was somewhat compatible with the but was mostly only able to run OS 9 software  A later version called the TC 70  running on a Signetics 68070  had strong compatibility with the MM 1  and also ran OS 9 68K   12 2  MM 1  The Multi Media One was introduced in July 1990  ran OS 9 68K on a 15 MHz Signetics 68070 processor with and had a 640x208 graphics resolution as well as supporting a 640x416 interlaced mode  It included a SCSI interface  stereo A D and D A conversion  an optional MIDI interface  and  later  an optional board to upgrade the CPU to a Motorola 68340 running at up to 25 MHz  It is estimated that about 500 units were sold   12 3  AT306  The AT306  also known as the MM 1B  was a successor to the MM 1 that contained a Motorola 68306 CPU  OS 9 68K 3 0  and was designed to allow the use of ISA bus cards  It was created by Kevin Pease and Carl Kreider  and sold by Carl s company  Kreider Electronics  It was also sold as the  WCP 306  by Bill Wittman of Wittman Computer Products   12 4  Delmar System IV Peripheral Technology PT68K 4  Peripheral Technology produced a 16 MHz Motorola 68000 system called a PTK68K 4  which was sold as a kit or a complete motherboard  Delmar sold complete systems based on the PT68K 4 and called the Delmar System IV  The PT68K 4 has the footprint of an IBM PC  so it will fit in a normal PC case  and it has seven 8 bit ISA slots  Video was provided by a standard IBM style monochrome  CGA  EGA  or VGA video card and monitor  but for high resolution graphics the software only supported certain ET4000 video cards  It appears that most users of this system used uses OS 9  but there are several operating systems for it  including REX  a FLEX like OS   and SK*DOS  Dan Farnsworth  who wrote REX  also wrote a BASIC interpreter that was fairly compatible to DECB  but it was too little  too late to be of interest to many CoCo users  There was also a card available called an ALT86  which was basically an IBM XT compatible computer on a card  which allowed the user to run DOS programs on it  In fact  both the 68000 and the ALT86 card could be run at the same time  if access to the ISA bus was not needed from the 68000 side of it   13  The 21st century  The CoCo still has a small but active user community despite a perceived lack of support from Tandy  Third party support was assisted by CoCo related periodicals  notably The Rainbow  Hot CoCo  and The Color Computer Magazine  Original hardware is being expanded by some small firms such as Cloud 9 with such things as SCSI and IDE hard drive controllers  memory upgrades to 512K and PS 2 Keyboard interfaces  Other recent hardware development includes an RGB to VGA Converter that allows connecting a CoCo 3 to a standard VGA compatible monitor   User driven support for the Color Computer has continued since production stopped in the  80s  hosted on various web sites and forums   13 1  Emulation  Emulation of the CoCo hardware has been possible on x86 PCs since at least the mid  90s  MESS is capable of emulating the CoCo  Other emulators include VCC  Jeff Vavasour s CoCo emulators and Mocha  a web based emulator written in Java that can emulate a CoCo 2 inside a web browser   Most of these emulators require a dump from the CoCo ROMs  Instructions are usually provided with the emulators on how to get a ROM dump from a CoCo  A ROM might be found online  which may be from a Brazilian CoCo clone   Utilities exist to transfer data from a PC to a CoCo  If one does not have compatible disk drives for the PC and CoCo  data may still be transferred by using special PC CoCo utilities to create a  wav audio file of the data  Hook the CoCo s cassette interface cables directly to the line out of a PC s soundcard  initiate the CLOAD  or CLOADM  command on the CoCo  and then play the sound file from the PC   14  See also  Dungeons of Daggorath  To Preserve Quandic  15  References  16
