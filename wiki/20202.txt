Meir David Kahane       August 1  1932 – November 5  1990  an American Israeli rabbi  ultranationalist writer  and political figure  whose work became either the direct or indirect foundation of most modern Jewish militant and extreme right wing political groups  He was an ordained Orthodox rabbi and later served as a member of the Israeli Knesset  Kahane gained recognition as an activist for Jewish causes  such as organizing Jewish self defense groups in deteriorating neighborhoods and the struggle for the right of Soviet Jews to immigrate  He later became known in the United States and Israel for violent terrorist attacks as well as political and religious views that included proposing emergency Jewish mass immigration to Israel due to the imminent threat of a  second Holocaust  in the United States  advocating that Israel s democracy be replaced by a state modeled on Jewish law  and promoting the idea of a Greater Israel in which Israel would annex the West Bank and Gaza Strip  In order to keep Arabs from becoming a numerical majority in Israel  he proposed a plan allowing Arabs to leave Israel and receive compensation for their property  or to remain as non citizens without political or voting rights  and forcibly removing Arabs who refused both options   Kahane founded the FBI listed terrorist group the Jewish Defense League  JDL  in the USA as well as an Israeli political party Kach   This is the Way    In 1971  he was convicted for plotting to manufacture explosives  In 1984 he became a member of the Knesset when Kach gained one seat in parliamentary elections  In 1988  the Israeli government banned Kach as  racist  and  anti democratic  under the terms of an ad hoc law   Kahane was killed in a Manhattan hotel by an Arab gunman in November 1990 after Kahane concluded a speech warning American Jews to emigrate to Israel before it was  too late   Some researchers  such as Peter Lance  consider him one of the first  if not the very first  victim of the then nascent Al Qaeda  as his killer is believed to have links to Osama bin Laden s network  The cell that Kahane s assassin belonged to had been training in the New York metro since the middle of 1989   In 2007 the FBI released over a thousand documents relating to their daily surveillance of Kahane since the early 1960s   Kahane s name has come up as precedent in many court cases  Two examples are the 1993 World Trade Center bombing case  where the defense tried unsuccessfully to argue that informants Emad Saleem and Ali Mohamed had entrapped the conspirators  as had been done by the FBI to Kahane  In another case brought up at the Israeli Supreme Court  the banning of Kahane s political party first and then upheld in appeal  within the framework of the Israeli Democracy  can be used to ban other parties deemed racist or which espouse racist views  The prosecution argued that Arab MP Haneen Zoabi should be banned for denying the Jewish People s existence and was banned by the Central Elections Committee  using the Kahane precedent  A week later this was unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court  Attempts at banning of Strong Israel and Balad political parties were overturned using the Kahane precedent unsuccessfully as well   Some notable 1960s era folk singers have made positive comments about Kahane  Woody Guthrie s son Arlo described Kahane as  a really nice  patient teacher  who tutored him for his Bar Mitzvah  However  he felt that Kahane subsequently  started going haywire   Woody and his wife Marjorie had both met Kahane  and separately decades later Bob Dylan referred to him as  a really sincere guy    1  Early life and education  Martin David Kahane was born in Brooklyn  New York City  New York  in 1932 to an Orthodox Jewish family  His father  Rabbi Yechezkel  Charles  Kahane  studied at Polish and Czech yeshiva religious schools  was involved in the Revisionist Zionism movement  and was a close friend of Ze ev Jabotinsky   As a teenager  he became an ardent admirer of Ze ev Jabotinsky and Peter Bergson  who were frequent guests in his parents  home  and joined the Betar  Brit Trumpeldor  youth wing of Revisionist Zionism  He was active in protests against Ernest Bevin  the British Foreign Secretary who maintained restrictions on immigration of Jews  including Nazi death camp survivors  to Palestine after the end of the Second World War  In 1947 Kahane was arrested for throwing eggs and tomatoes at Bevin  as the latter disembarked at Pier 84 on a visit to New York  A photo of the arrest appeared in the New York Daily News  In 1954  he became the mazkir  director  of Greater New York City’s sixteen Bnei Akiva chapters   Kahane’s formal education included elementary school at the Yeshiva of Flatbush and high school at both Abraham Lincoln H S  and at the Brooklyn Talmudical Academy  Kahane received his rabbinical ordination from the Mir Yeshiva in Brooklyn  where he changed his name from Martin to Meir   and earned a B A  in political science from Brooklyn College  He was fully conversant with the Talmud and Tanakh  Jewish Bible   and worked as a pulpit rabbi and teacher in the 1960s  Subsequently  he earned a Bachelor of Law – LL B  from New York Law School and M A  in International Relations from New York University   2  Serving as pulpit rabbi  In 1956  Kahane married Libby  with whom he had four children  including Tova  Baruch and Binyamin  In 1958  he became the rabbi of the Howard Beach Jewish Center in Queens  New York City  The synagogue was traditional rather than strictly Orthodox but they installed a mechitzah  a partition that is used to separate men and women  before he took the position  At the Jewish Center  Kahane influenced many of the synagogue’s youngsters to adopt a more observant lifestyle and this angered their parents  He trained Arlo Guthrie for his bar mitzvah  His contract was not renewed and he soon published an article entitled “End of the Miracle of Howard Beach ” This was Kahane’s first article in the Jewish Press  American Jewish weekly  for which he continued to write until his assassination in 1990  Kahane also used the pen name David Sinai and the pseudonyms Michael King  David Borac and Martin Keene   3  Becoming Michael King and Infiltrating John Birch Society  At some time in the late 1950s  Mr  Kahane took on the persona of a non religious individual  living a double life  shaving his beard and renamed himself Michael King  Kahane became a demagogue at this point according to most accounts  and re imagined himself as virulently and violently anti Communist and anti hippie  He created the  July Fourth Movement  which targeted left wing groups on US college campuses across the US  financed by the US Government  During this period  Kahane attempted to rekindle his Brooklyn College friendship with Joseph Churba which resulted in them co authoring the text   The Jewish Stake in Vietnam  together  which was an attempt to convince American Jews of the  evil of Communism   Kahane and Churba wrote  All Americans have a stake in this grim war against Communism     it is vital that Jews realize the threat to their very survival  should Communism succeed   from the introduction  Churba had a major falling out with Kahane over the use of para militarism  and they permanently parted ways  he went on to pursue his own career  joining the US Air Force  writing many books on the Middle East  later becoming one of Ronald Reagan s consultants  Kahane chose a violent path  even attempting to acquire and grow biological weapons to use on a Soviet military installation but failed  Following the failure to get FBI training in the use of biological weapons  and the suicide of his  Michael King  persona s non Jewish mistress  he began using the phrase  Never Again   wrote a book with that title  a few years after his first article using that phrase appeared   also conceiving the Jewish Star and fist insignia  a similar symbol to the Black Panther party  though Kahane himself was against the Black Panther party due to anti Jewish riots they had supported in Massachusetts as he saw it  and leftist leanings as he saw it   In the late 1950s to early 1960s  Kahane s life of secrecy and strong anti communist views landed him a position as a consultant with the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   According to his wife Libby  his assignment was to infiltrate the anti communist John Birch Society and report his findings back to the FBI  As reported by Michael T  Kaufman in The New York Times  and subsequently followed up by The Village Voice in the early 1980s   Kahane  under his pseudonym Michael King  allegedly had an affair with a non Jewish woman  Gloria Jean D Argenio  In 1966  Kahane King allegedly sent a letter to D Argenio in which he unilaterally ended their relationship  According to Friedman  Kahane had proposed to D Argenio  and two days before the wedding  admitted he was already married with children  In response  D Argenio jumped off the Queensboro   59th Street    Ed Koch   Bridge  she died of her injuries the next day  According to Kaufman  Kahane admitted to him that  he loved Ms D Argenio and had placed roses on her grave for months after her death   He also established a foundation which carried the name she used in her modeling career  Estelle Donna Evans  Ads for the foundation appeared weekly in the Jewish Press  although the group never filed legally required financial documents detailing what it did with the money it collected   4  Terrorism and the Jewish Defense League  The Jewish Defense League  JDL  is an FBI listed terrorist group founded by Kahane in New York City in 1968  JDL s self described purpose was to protect Jews from local manifestations of antisemitism  According to the Anti Defamation League  Kahane  preached a radical form of Jewish nationalism which reflected racism  violence and political extremism  and those attitudes were replicated by Irv Rubin  the JDL successor to Kahane  In a 1971 interview  Bob Dylan made positive comments about Kahane  In Time Magazine  Dylan stated   He s a really sincere guy  He s really put it all together   According to Kahane  Dylan did attend several meetings of the Jewish Defense League in order to find out  what we re all about  and started to have talks with the rabbi  Subsequently  Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane   A number of the JDL members and leaders  including Kahane  were convicted in relation to acts of domestic terrorism in the United States  In 1971  Kahane was sentenced to 5 years in prison  suspended  for conspiring to manufacture explosives  In 1975  Kahane was arrested for leading the attack on the police outside the Soviet United Nations mission and injuring two officers  but was released after being given summonses for disorderly conduct  Later that same year  Kahane was accused of conspiring to kidnap a Soviet diplomat  bomb the Iraqi embassy in Washington  and ship arms abroad from Israel  He was convicted of violating his probation for the 1971 bomb conviction and sentenced to one year in prison  However he served most of it in a hotel  with frequently unsupervised absences  due to a concession over the provision of kosher food  He also announced that the JDL planned to recruit a 150 000 member volunteer  army  of Americans to fight for Israel  even as such an  army  had no approval from the Israeli government  In a 1984 interview with Washington Post correspondent Carla Hall  Kahane admitted that the JDL  bombed the Russian  Soviet  mission in New York  the Russian cultural mission here  Washington  in 1971  the Soviet trade offices    5  Immigration to Israel  Knesset service  In 1971  Kahane emigrated to Israel  When he moved to Israel  Kahane declared that he would focus on Jewish education  However  he soon began initiating protests advocating the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the occupied territories  In 1972  Jewish Defense League leaflets were distributed in Hebron  calling for the mayor to stand trial for the 1929 Hebron massacre  Kahane was arrested dozens of times  In 1971  he founded the Kach party  In 1973  the party ran for the Knesset  Israeli parliament  during the general elections under the name  The League List   The party won 12 811 votes  0 82%   just 2 857  0 18%  short of the electoral threshold at the time  1%  for winning a Knesset seat  The party was even less successful in the 1977 elections  winning 4 836 votes   In 1980  Kahane was arrested for the 62nd time since his emigration and jailed for six months following a detention order based on allegations of planning armed attacks against Palestinians in response to the killings of Jewish settlers  Kahane was held in prison in Ramla  where he wrote the book They Must Go  Kahane claimed in the book s preface that a prisoner in the same wing was a Bedouin from the Negev about to be released after serving an eighteen year prison sentence for the rape and murder of a Jewish girl   In 1981  Kahane s Kach party again ran for the Knesset during the 1981 elections  but did not win a seat  receiving only 5 128 votes  In 1984  the Central Elections Committee banned him from being a candidate on the grounds that Kach was a racist party  but the Israeli Supreme Court overturned the ban on grounds that the committee was not authorized to ban Kahane s candidacy  The Supreme Court suggested that the Knesset pass a law that would authorize the exclusion of racist parties from future elections  and the Anti Racist Law of 1988 was later passed  In the 1984 legislative elections  Kahane s Kach party received 25 907 votes  enough to give the party one seat in the Knesset  which was taken by Kahane  Kahane refused to take the standard oath of office and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from Psalms  to indicate that when the national laws and Torah conflict  Torah  Biblical  law should have supremacy over the laws of the Knesset  Kahane s legislative proposals focused on transferring the Arab population out from the Land of Israel  revoking Israeli citizenship from non Jews  and banning Jewish Gentile marriages and sexual relations  based on the Code of Jewish Law compiled by Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah   As his political career progressed  Kahane became increasingly isolated in the Knesset  His speeches  boycotted by Knesset members  were made to an empty parliament  except for the duty chairman and the transcriptionist  Kahane s legislative proposals and motions of no confidence against the government were ignored or rejected by fellow Knesset members  Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members  Hellenists  in Hebrew  a reference to Jews who assimilated into Greek culture after Judea s occupation by Alexander the Great   In 1987  Kahane opened a yeshiva  HaRaayon HaYehudi  with funding from US supporters  for the teaching of  the Authentic Jewish Idea   Despite the boycott  Kahane s popularity grew among the Israeli public  especially among working class Sephardi Jews  Polls showed that Kach would have likely received three to four seats in the coming November 1988 elections   In 1985  the Knesset passed an amendment to Israel s Basic Law  barring  racist  candidates from election  The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time  and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court  This time  the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the committee  disqualifying Kach from running in the 1988 elections  Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism   6  Assassination  In November 1990  following a speech to an audience of mostly Orthodox Jews from Brooklyn  as a crowd of well wishers gathered around Kahane in the second floor lecture hall in midtown Manhattan s Marriott East Side Hotel  Kahane was assassinated  He was shot to death by El Sayyid Nosair  an Egyptian born American citizen who was initially charged and acquitted of the murder  Nosair was later convicted of the murder in United States district court incident to the trial for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing  Prosecutors were able to retry Nosair for the murder because the federal indictment includes the killing as part of the alleged terrorist conspiracy  He was sentenced to life imprisonment  and later made a confession to federal agents  Kahane was buried on Har HaMenuchot in Jerusalem  Kahane s funeral was one of the largest in Israel s history  where approximately 150 000 participated   7  Ideology  Kahane argued that there was a glory in Jewish destiny  which came through the observance of the Torah  stating that  democracy and Judaism are not the same thing   Kahane also believed that a Jewish democracy with non Jewish citizens was self contradictory because the non Jewish citizens might someday become a numerical majority and vote to make the state non Jewish   The question is as follows  if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority  will Israel continue to be a Jewish state  Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide    Western democracy has to be ruled out  For me that s cut and dried  there s no question of setting up democracy in Israel  because democracy means equal rights for all  irrespective of racial or religious origins    Kahane proposed the forcible deportation of nearly all Arabs from all lands controlled by the Israeli government  He framed this deportation as an  exchange of populations  that would continue the Jewish exodus from Arab lands   A total of some 750 000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948  Surely it is time for Jews  worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel  to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35  50  years ago   Kahane proposed a $40 000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily  forcible expulsion  for those who don’t want to leave   and encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews   I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence  Really  I don’t think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it  They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus    Kahane proposed that Israel expand its boundaries  according to the description given in the Bible   He said   the southern boundary goes up to El Arish  which takes in all of northern Sinai  including Yamit  To the east  the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the Jordan River  hence part of what is now Jordan  Eretz Yisrael also includes part of Lebanon and certain parts of Syria  and part of Iraq  all the way to the Tigris River  When critics suggested this would mean perpetual war between Jews and Arabs  Kahane answered   There will be a perpetual war  With or without Kahane    8  Political legacy  Following Kahane s death  no charismatic leader emerged to replace him in the movement  although the idea of transferring populations  mainly attributed to Kahane  was subsequently incorporated into the political platform of various political parties in Israel  such as Moledet  applying to Arab non citizen residents of the West Bank  and Yisrael Beiteinu  in the form of population exchange   Two small Kahanist factions later emerged  one under the name of Kach and the other Kahane chai  Hebrew  כהנא חי  literally  Kahane lives  on     the second one led by his younger son  Binyamin Ze ev Kahane  Neither one was permitted to participate in the Knesset elections by the Central Elections Committee  however   In 1994  following the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre of Palestinian Muslim worshippers in Hebron by Kach supporter Dr  Baruch Goldstein  in which 29 Palestinian Muslim worshippers were killed  the Israeli government declared both parties to be terrorist organizations  The U S  State Department also added Kach and Kahane Chai to its list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations   On December 31  2000  Binyamin Ze ev Kahane and his wife Talya were shot to death by Palestinian gunmen while on their way to the Israeli settlement of Kfar Tapuach  where they lived  Five of their six children were wounded in the attack  Palestinian gunmen fired more than 60 machine gun rounds into their van   In the 2003 Knesset elections Herut  which split off from the National Union list  ran with Michael Kleiner and former Kach activist Baruch Marzel taking the top two spots on the list  The joint effort narrowly missed the 1 5% barrier  In the following 2006 elections Jewish National Front led by Baruch Marzel  fared better but also failed to pass the minimum threshold  A self declared follower of Kahane who was involved with Kach for many years  Michael Ben Ari  was elected to the Knesset in the 2009 elections on renewed National Union list  He stood again in the 2013 elections as the second candidate on the list of Otzma LeYisrael  but the party failed to pass the minimum threshold   9  See also  Politics of Israel  10  Publications
