The 1800s decade lasted from January 1  1800  to December 31  1809   1  Politics and wars  1 1  Napoleonic Wars  The European political landscape was dominated by the Napoleonic Wars  a series of conflicts declared against Napoleon s First French Empire and changing sets of European allies by opposing coalitions that ran from 1803 to 1815  As a continuation of the wars sparked by the French Revolution of 1789  they revolutionized European armies and played out on an unprecedented scale  mainly due to the application of modern mass conscription  French power rose quickly  conquering most of Europe by the end of the decade  The decade brought hard times   On 9 November 1799  18 Brumaire   Napoleon overthrew the French government  replacing it with the Consulate  in which he was First Consul  On 2 December 1804  after a failed assassination plot  he crowned himself Emperor  In 1805  Napoleon planned to invade Britain  but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria  Third Coalition   forced him to turn his attention towards the continent  while at the same time failure to lure the superior British fleet away from the English Channel  ending in a decisive French defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October put an end to hopes of an invasion of Britain  On 2 December 1805  Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro Russian army at Austerlitz  forcing Austria s withdrawal from the coalition  see Treaty of Pressburg  and dissolving the Holy Roman Empire  In 1806  a Fourth Coalition was set up  on 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Jena Auerstedt  marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at Friedland  The Treaties of Tilsit divided Europe between France and Russia and created the Duchy of Warsaw   The War of the Fifth Coalition  fought in the year 1809  pitted a coalition of the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom against the French Empire and Bavaria  Major engagements between France and Austria  the main participants  unfolded over much of Central Europe from April to July  with very high casualty rates  Britain  already involved on the European continent in the ongoing Peninsular War  sent another expedition  the Walcheren Campaign  to the Netherlands in order to relieve the Austrians  although this effort had little impact on the outcome of the conflict  After much campaigning in Bavaria and across the Danube valley  the war ended favorably for the French after the bloody struggle at Wagram in early July  resulting in the Treaty of Schönbrunn   Although fighting in the Iberian Peninsula continued  the War of the Fifth Coalition was the last major conflict on the European continent until the French invasion of Russia in 1812 sparked the Sixth Coalition   1 2

the period of 1798 and 1808  approximately 200 000 slaves were imported from Africa to the United States  Still  the abolitionist movement began to gain ground in this period  Britain enacted the Slave Trade Act 1807  which barred the trade of slaves in Great Britain  though slavery was still legal   The United States enacted a similar ban in 1808  However  Napoleon revoked the French Empire s ban on slavery with the Law of 20 May 1802   1 4  Prominent political events  1801  Under the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801  Washington  D C   a new planned city and capital of the United States  was placed under the jurisdiction of the U S  Congress   The Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merge into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801   1803

technology  2 1  Electricity  This decade contained some of the earliest experiments in electrochemistry  In 1800 Alessandro Volta constructed a voltaic pile  the first device to produce a large electric current  later known as the electric battery  Napoleon  informed of his works  summoned him in 1801 for a command performance of his experiments  He received many medals and decorations  including the Légion d honneur   Also in 1800  William Nicholson and Johann Wilhelm Ritter succeeded in decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis  Soon thereafter Ritter discovered the process of electroplating  He also observed that the amount of metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic process depended on the distance between the electrodes  By 1801 Ritter observed thermoelectric currents and anticipated the discovery of thermoelectricity by Thomas Johann Seebeck   In 1806  Humphry Davy decomposed potash and soda  employing a voltaic pile of approximately 250 cells  showing that these substances were respectively the oxides of potassium and sodium  which metals previously had been unknown  Employing a battery of 2 000 elements of a voltaic pile and charcoal enclosed in a vacuum  Davy gave the first public demonstration of the electric arc lamp in 1809   2 2  Transportation  Steam transportation started to become viable during this decade  In 1803  William Symington s Charlotte Dundas  generally considered to be the world s first practical steamboat  made her first voyage  Later  in 1807  Robert Fulton s North River Steamboat  the world s first commercially successful steamboat  made her maiden voyage   In 1801  Richard Trevithick ran a full sized steam  road locomotive  on the road in Camborne  England  followed by his 10 seater London Steam Carriage in 1803  In 1804  Trevithick built a prototype steam powered railway locomotive   The first railway began operating during this time  The Surrey Iron Railway in Great Britain was established by the British Parliament in 1801  and began operation on 26 July 1803  The railway relied on horse drawn cars rather than trains   In 1807  Isaac de Rivas made a hydrogen gas powered vehicle  the first vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine  James Watt creates first steam engine based off Newcomen s design   2 3  Astronomy  The first known asteroids are discovered in this decade   Ceres  January 2  1801   Ceres is reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006   Pallas  March 28  1802   Juno  September 1  1804   Vesta  March 29  1807   2 4  Other advances  Invention of the Jacquard loom in 1801   Ultraviolet radiation is discovered by Johann Wilhelm Ritter in 1801   Flag semaphore is gradually adopted by various navies of the world   Morphine

 Fashion  Fashion in this period in European and European influenced countries saw the final triumph of undress or informal styles over the brocades  lace  periwig  and powder of the earlier eighteenth century   Fashionable women s clothing styles were based on the Empire silhouette — dresses were closely fitted to the torso just under the bust  falling loosely below  Inspired by neoclassical tastes  the short waisted gowns sported soft  flowing skirts and were often made of white  almost transparent muslin  which was easily washed and draped loosely like the garments on Greek and Roman statues  No respectable woman would leave the house without a hat or bonnet  The antique head dress  or Queen Mary coif  Chinese hat  Oriental inspired turban  and Highland helmet were popular  As for bonnets  their crowns and brims were adorned with increasingly elaborate ornamentations  such as feathers and ribbons  In fact  ladies of the day embellished their hats frequently  replacing old decorations with new trims or feathers   1800–1809 was the height of dandyism in men s fashion in Europe  following the example of Beau Brummell  Older men  military officers  and those in conservative professions such as lawyers and physicians retained their wigs and powder into this period  but younger men of fashion wore their hair in short curls  often with long sideburns  This period saw the final abandonment of lace  embroidery  and other embellishment from serious men s clothing outside of formalized court dress  Instead  cut and tailoring became much more important as an indicator of quality   3 3  Other  November 10  1809 – Berners Street Hoax  Theodore Hook manages to attract dozens of people to 54 Berners Street in London   4  Wikisource reference work  5
