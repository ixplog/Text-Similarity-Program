Lucent Technologies  Inc  was an American multinational telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Murray Hill  New Jersey  in the United States  It was established on September 30  1996 through the divestiture of the former AT&T Technologies business unit of AT&T Corporation  which included Western Electric and Bell Labs   Lucent was merged with Alcatel SA of France in a merger of equals on December 1  2006  forming Alcatel Lucent   1  Name  Lucent means  light bearing  in Latin  The name was applied in 1996 at the time of the split from AT&T   The name was widely criticised  as the logo was to be  both internally and externally  Corporate communications and business cards included the strapline  Bell Labs Innovations  in a bid to retain the prestige of the internationally famous research lab  within a new business under an as yet unknown name   This same linguistic root also gives Lucifer   the light bearer   from lux   light   and ferre   to bear    who is also a character in Dante s epic poem Inferno  Shortly after the Lucent renaming in 1996  the Plan 9 project released a development of their work as the Inferno OS in 1997  This extended the  Lucifer  and Dante references as a series of punning names for the components of Inferno   Dis  Limbo  Charon and Styx   When the rights to Inferno were sold in 2000  the company Vita Nuova Holdings was formed to represent them  This continues the Dante theme  although moving away from his Divine Comedy to the poem La Vita Nuova   2  Logo  The Lucent logo  the Innovation Ring  was designed by Landor Associates  a prominent San Francisco based branding consultancy  One source inside Lucent says that the logo is actually a Zen Buddhist symbol for  eternal truth   the Enso  turned 90 degrees and modified  Another source says it represents the mythic ouroboros  a snake holding its tail in its mouth  Lucent s logo also has been said to represent constant re creating and re thinking   After the logo was compared in the media to the ring a coffee mug leaves on paper  a Dilbert comic strip showed Dogbert as an overpaid consultant designing a new company logo  he takes a piece of paper that his coffee cup was sitting on and calls it the  Brown Ring of Quality   A telecommunication commentator referred to the logo as  a big red zero  and predicted financial losses   3  History  Two of the primary reasons AT&T Corporation chose to spin off its equipment manufacturing business was to permit it to profit from sales to competing telecommunications providers  these customers had previously shown reluctance to purchase from a direct competitor  Bell Labs brought prestige to the new company  as well as the revenue from thousands of patents  Lucent also operated from 666 Fifth Avenue  NY   At the time of its spinoff  Lucent was placed under the leadership of Henry Schacht  who was brought in to oversee its transition from an arm of AT&T into an independent corporation  Richard McGinn  who was serving as President and COO  succeeded Schacht as CEO in 1997 while Schacht remained chairman of the board  Lucent became a  darling  stock of the investment community in the late 1990s  rising from a split adjusted spinoff price of $7 56 share to a high of $84  Its market capitalization reached a high of $258 billion  and it was at the time the most widely held company with 5 3 million shareholders   In 1997  Lucent acquired Milpitas based voice mail market leader Octel Communications Corporation for $2 1 billion  a move which immediately rendered the Business Systems Group profitable  By 1999 Lucent stock continued to soar and in that year Lucent acquired Ascend Communications  an Alameda  California–based manufacturer of communications equipment for US$24 billion  Lucent held discussions to acquire Juniper Networks but decided instead to build its own routers internally   However at the start of 2000  Lucent s  private bubble burst   while other competitors like Nortel Networks and Alcatel were still going strong as it would be many months before the rest of the telecom industry bubble collapsed  Previously Lucent had 14 straight quarters where it exceeded analysts  expectations  leading to high expectations for the 15th quarter  ending Dec  31  1999  On January 6  2000  Lucent made the first of a string of announcements that it had missed its quarterly estimates  as CEO Rich McGinn grimly announced that Lucent had run into special problems during that quarter—including disruptions in its optical networking business—and reported flat revenues and a big drop in profits  That caused the stock to plunge by 28%  shaving $64 billion off of the company s market capitalization  When it was later revealed that it had used dubious accounting and sales practices to generate some of its earlier quarterly numbers  Lucent fell from grace  It was said that  Rich McGinn that couldn t accept Lucent s fall from its early triumphs   He described himself once as imposing  audacious  goals on his managers  believing the stretch for performance would produce dream results  Henry Schacht defended the corporate culture that McGinn created and also noted that McGinn did not sell any Lucent shares while serving as CEO  In November 2000  it also disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had a $125 million accounting error for the third quarter of 2000  and by December 2000 it reported it had overstated its revenues for its latest quarter by nearly $700 million  Although no wrongdoing was found on his part  McGinn was forced to resign as CEO and he was replaced by Schacht on an interim basis  Subsequently  its CFO  Deborah Hopkins  left the company in May 2001 with Lucent s stock at $9 06 whereas at the time she was hired it was at $46 82   In 2001 there were merger discussions between Lucent and Alcatel  which would have seen Lucent acquired at its current market price without a premium and the newly combined entity would have been headquartered in Murray Hill  However these negotiations collapsed when Schacht insisted on an equal 7 7 split of the merged company s board of directors  while Alcatel chief executive officer Serge Tchuruk wanted 8 of the 14 board seats for Alcatel due to it being in a stronger position  The failure of the merger talks caused Lucent s share price to collapse  and by October 2002 the stock price had bottomed at 55 cents per share   Patricia Russo  formerly Lucent s EVP of the Corporate Office who then left for Eastman Kodak to serve as COO  was named permanent Chairman and CEO of Lucent in 2002  succeeding Schacht who remained on the Board of Directors   In April 2000  Lucent sold its Consumer Products unit to VTech and Consumer Phone Services  In October 2000  Lucent spun off its Business Systems arm into Avaya  Inc   and in June 2002  it spun off its microelectronics division into Agere Systems  The spinoffs of enterprise networking and wireless  the industry s key growth businesses from 2003 onward  meant that Lucent no longer had the capacity to serve this market   Lucent was reduced to 30 500 employees  down from about 165 000 employees at its zenith  The layoffs of so many experienced employees meant that the company was in a weakened position and unable to reestablish itself when the market recovered in 2003  By early 2003 Lucent s market value was $15 6 billion  which includes $6 8 billion of current value for two companies that Lucent had recently spun off  Avaya and Agere Systems   make the shares worth around $2 13  a far cry from its dotcom bubble peak when Lucent was worth $258 billion   Lucent continued to be active in the areas of telephone switching  optical  data and wireless networking   On April 2  2006  Lucent announced a merger agreement with Alcatel  which was 1 5 times the size of Lucent  Serge Tchuruk became non executive chairman  and Russo served as CEO of the newly merged company  Alcatel Lucent  until they were both forced to resign at the end of 2008  The merger failed to produce the expected synergies  and there were significant write downs of Lucent s assets that Alcatel purchased   4  Operations  4 1  Divisions  Lucent was divided into several core groups   Network Solutions Group   served landline cellular telephone service providers by providing equipment & other solutions necessary to provide telephone service  including networking equipment  Lucent Worldwide Services  LWS    provided network services to telecom companies and business  clients included AT&T Corporation and Verizon   Bell Labs   created in 1925 as the R&D firm of the Bell System  It was an AT&T subsidiary set up as dual ownership by AT&T and Western Electric  the manufacturing arm of AT&T  Bell Labs has accumulated over 31 000 patents in its existence  some of which include development of the LED and discovery of the measure of sound   4 2  Murray Hill facility  The Murray Hill anechoic chamber  built in 1940  is the world s oldest wedge based anechoic chamber  The interior room measures approximately high by wide by deep  The exterior concrete and brick walls are about thick to keep outside noise from entering the chamber  The chamber absorbs over 99 995% of the incident acoustic energy above 200 Hz  At one time the Murray Hill chamber was cited in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world s quietest room  It is possible to hear the sounds of skeletal joints and heart beats very prominently   The Murray Hill facility was the global headquarters for Lucent Technologies  The Murray Hill facility also has the largest copper roof in the world  When Lucent Technologies was experiencing financial troubles in 2000 and 2001  one out of every three fluorescent lights was turned off in the facility  The same was done in the Naperville and Allentown  Pennsylvania facilities for a while  The facility had a cricket field and featured a nearby station from which enthusiasts could control RC airplanes and helicopters   5  See also  Carly Fiorina  driving force behind the split of AT&T that created Lucent   6  References  7  References  Lazonick  William  and
