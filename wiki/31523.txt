The Avengers is a sy fy British television series created in the 1960s  The Avengers initially focused on Dr  David Keel  Ian Hendry  and his assistant John Steed  Patrick Macnee   Hendry left after the first series and Steed became the main character  partnered with a succession of assistants  Steed s most famous assistants were intelligent  stylish and assertive women  Cathy Gale  Honor Blackman   Emma Peel  Diana Rigg   and later Tara King  Linda Thorson   Later episodes increasingly incorporated elements of science fiction and fantasy  parody and British eccentricity  The Avengers ran from 1961 until 1969  screening as one hour episodes its entire run   The pilot episode   Hot Snow   aired on 7 January 1961  The final episode   Bizarre   aired on 21 May 1969   The Avengers was produced by Associated British Corporation  a contractor within the ITV network  After a merger in July 1968 ABC Television became Thames Television  which continued production of the series although it was still broadcast under the ABC name  By 1969 The Avengers was shown in more than 90 countries  ITV produced a sequel series The New Avengers  1976–1977  with Patrick Macnee returning as John Steed  and two new partners   In 2007 The Avengers was ranked #20 on TV Guides Top Cult Shows Ever   1  Programme premise and overview  The Avengers was marked by different eras as co stars came and went  The only constant was John Steed  played by Patrick Macnee   1 1  1961  With Dr David Keel  Ian Hendry   The Avengers began in the episode  Hot Snow   with medical doctor  Dr David Keel  Ian Hendry   investigating the murder of his fiancée and office receptionist Peggy by a drug ring  A stranger named John Steed  who was investigating the ring  appeared and together they set out to avenge her death in the first two episodes  Afterwards  Steed asked Keel to partner him as needed to solve crimes   The Avengers followed Hendry s Police Surgeon  in which he played police surgeon Geoffrey Brent  While Police Surgeon did not last long  viewers praised Hendry  Hendry was considered the star of the new series  receiving top billing over Macnee  and Steed did not appear in two episodes   As the series progressed  Steed s importance increased  and he carried the final episode solo  While Steed and Keel used wit while discussing crimes and dangers  the series also depicted the interplay—and often tension—between Keel s idealism and Steed s professionalism  As seen in one of the two surviving episodes from the first series   The Frighteners   Steed also had helpers among the population who provided information  similar to the  Baker Street Irregulars  of Sherlock Holmes   The other regular in the first series was Carol Wilson  Ingrid Hafner   the nurse and receptionist who replaced the slain Peggy  Carol assisted Keel and Steed in cases  without being part of Steed s inner circle  Hafner had played opposite Hendry as a nurse in Police Surgeon   The series was shot on 405 line videotape using a multicamera setup  There was little provision for editing and virtually no location footage  although the very first shot of the first episode consisted of location footage   As was standard practice at the time  videotapes of early episodes of The Avengers were reused  Of the first series  two complete episodes still exist  as 16 mm film telerecordings  One of the episodes remaining does not feature Steed  The first 15 minutes of the first episode also exists as a telerecording  the extant footage ends at the conclusion of the first act  prior to the introduction of John Steed   The missing television episodes are currently being re created for audio by Big Finish Productions under the title of The Avengers   The Lost Episodes and star Julian Wadham as Steed  Anthony Howell as Dr  Keel and Lucy Briggs Owen as Carol Wilson   1 2  1962–64  With Cathy Gale  Honor Blackman   Venus Smith  Julie Stevens  and Dr Martin King  Jon Rollason   Production of the first series was cut short by a strike  By the time production could begin on the second series  Hendry had quit to pursue a film career  Macnee was promoted to star and Steed became the focus of the series  initially working with a rotation of three different partners  Dr Martin King  Jon Rollason   a thinly disguised rewriting of Keel  saw action in only three episodes produced from scripts written for the first series  King was intended to be a transitional character between Keel and Steed s two new female partners  but while the Dr  King episodes were shot first  they were shown out of production order in the middle of the season  The character was thereafter quickly and quietly dropped   Nightclub singer Venus Smith  Julie Stevens  appeared in six episodes  She was a complete  amateur   meaning that she did not have any professional crime fighting skills as did the two doctors  She was excited to be participating in a  spy  adventure alongside secret agent Steed  although some episodes— The Removal Men    The Decapod —indicate she is not always enthusiastic   Nonetheless  she appears to be attracted to him and their relationship is somewhat similar to that later portrayed between Steed and Tara King  Her episodes featured musical interludes showcasing her singing performances  The character of Venus underwent some revision during her run  adopting more youthful demeanor and dress   The first episode broadcast in the second series had introduced the partner who would change the show into the format for which it is most remembered  Honor Blackman played Dr Cathy Gale  a self assured  quick witted anthropologist who was skilled in judo and had a passion for leather clothes  Widowed during the Mau Mau years in Kenya  she was the  talented amateur  who saw her aid to Steed s cases as a service to her nation  She was said to have been born 5 October 1930 at midnight and raised in Africa  Gale was early to mid 30s during her tenure  in contrast to female characters in similar series who tended to be younger   Gale was unlike any female character seen before on British TV and became a household name  Reportedly  part of her charm was because her earliest appearances were episodes in which dialogue written for Keel was simply transferred to her  Said series script writer Dennis Spooner  there s the famous story of how Honor Blackman played Ian Hendry s part  which is why they stuck her in leather and such—it was so much cheaper than changing the lines   In  Conspiracy of Silence  she holds her own in a vociferous tactical disagreement with her partner   Venus Smith did not return for the third series and Cathy Gale became Steed s only regular partner  The series established a level of sexual tension between Steed and Gale  but the writers were not allowed to go beyond flirting and innuendo  Despite this the relationship between Steed and Gale was progressive for 1962–63  In  The Golden Eggs  it is revealed that Gale lived in Steed s flat  her rent according to Steed was to keep the refrigerator well stocked and to cook for him  she appears to do neither   However  this was said to be a temporary arrangement while Gale looked for a new home  and Steed was sleeping at a hotel   During the first series there were hints Steed worked for a branch of British Intelligence  and this was expanded in the second series  Steed initially received orders from different superiors  including someone referred to as  Charles   and  One Ten   Douglas Muir   By the third series the delivery of Steed s orders was not depicted on screen or explained  In  The Nutshell  the secret organization to which Steed belongs is shown  and it is Gale s first visit to their HQ   Small references to Steed s background were occasionally made  In series three s  Death of a Batman  it was said that Steed was with I Corps in World War II  and in Munich in 1945  In series four episode  The Hour That Never Was  Steed attends a reunion of his RAF regiment  However the ties he wears are either cavalry or old school  apparently have attended a number of leading public schools   A film version of the series was in its initial planning stages by late 1963 after series three was completed  An early story proposal paired Steed and Gale with a male and female duo of American agents  to make the movie appeal to the American market  Before the project could gain momentum Blackman was cast opposite Sean Connery in Goldfinger  requiring her to leave the series   1 3  Series transformation  During the Gale era  Steed was transformed from a rugged trenchcoat wearing agent into the stereotypical English gentleman  he had first donned bowler and carried his distinctive umbrella part way through the first season as  The Frighteners  depicts   complete with Savile Row suit  bowler hat  and umbrella with clothes later designed by Pierre Cardin   The bowler and umbrella were soon changed to be full of tricks including a sword hidden within the umbrella handle and a steel plate concealed in the hat   These items were referred to in the French  German  and Polish titles of the series  Chapeau melon et bottes de cuir   Bowler hat and leather boots    Mit Schirm  Charme und Melone   With Umbrella  Charm and Bowler Hat   and Rewolwer i melonik   A Revolver and a Bowler Hat    respectively  With his impeccable manners  old world sophistication  and vintage automobiles  Steed came to represent the traditional Englishman of an earlier era   By contrast his partners were youthful  forward looking  and always dressed in the latest mod fashions  Gale s innovative leather outfits suited her many athletic fight scenes  Honor Blackman became a star in Britain with her black leather outfits and boots  nicknamed  kinky boots   and her judo based fighting style  She also carried a pistol in  Killer Whale   Macnee and Blackman even released a novelty song called  Kinky Boots   Some of the clothes seen in The Avengers were designed at the studio of John Sutcliffe who published the AtomAge fetish magazine   Series script writer Dennis Spooner said that the series would frequently feature Steed visiting busy public places such as the main airport in London without anyone else present in the scene    Can t you afford extras   they d ask  Well  it wasn t like that  It s just that Steed had to be alone to be accepted  Put him in a crowd and he sticks out like a sore thumb  Let s face it  with normal people he s weird  The trick to making him acceptable is never to show him in a normal world  just fighting villains who are odder than he is    1 4  1965–68  With Emma Peel  Diana Rigg   In 1965 the show was sold to a United States network  the American Broadcasting Company  ABC   The Avengers became one of the first British series to be aired on prime time U S  television  The ABC network paid the then unheard of sum of $2 million for the first 26 episodes  The average budget for each episode was reportedly £56 000  which was high for the British industry  The fourth series aired in the U S  from March to December 1966   Previously The Avengers had been shot on 405 line videotape using a multicamera setup with very little provision for editing and virtually no location footage  The U S  deal meant that the producers could afford to start shooting the series on 35mm film  The use of film rather than videotape was essential as British 405 line video was technically incompatible with the U S  NTSC videotape format  Filmed productions were standard on U S  prime time television at that time  The Avengers continued to be produced in black and white   The transfer to film meant that episodes would be shot using the single camera setup  giving the production greater flexibility  The use of film production and the single camera production style allowed more sophisticated visuals and camera angles and more outdoor location shots  all of which greatly improved the look of the series  As was standard on British television filmed production through the 1960s  all location work on series four was shot mute with the soundtrack created in post production  Dialogue scenes were filmed in the studio  leading to some jumps between location and studio footage   New female partner Mrs Emma Peel  Diana Rigg  debuted in this series in October 1965  The name of the character derived from a comment by writers  during development  that they wanted a character with  man appeal   In an early attempt to incorporate this concept into the character s name  she was called  Samantha Peel  shortened to the awkward  Mantha Peel   Eventually the writers began referring to the idea by the verbal shorthand  M  Appeal  which gave rise to the character s ultimate name  Emma Peel  whose husband went missing while flying over the Amazon  retained the self assuredness of Gale  combined with superior fighting skills  intelligence  and a contemporary fashion sense   After more than 60 actresses had been auditioned  the first choice to play the role was Elizabeth Shepherd  However  after filming one and a half episodes  the pilot   The Town of No Return  and part of  The Murder Market    Shepherd was released  Her on screen personality was deemed less interesting than that of Blackman s Gale and it was decided she was not right for the role  Another 20 actresses were auditioned before the show s casting director suggested that producers Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell check out a televised drama featuring the relatively unknown Rigg  she had earlier guested in an episode of the TV show   The Sentimental Agent   that Clemens had written   Her screen test with Macnee showed that the two immediately worked well together and a new era in Avengers history began   A prologue was added to the beginning of all the fourth series episodes for the American transmissions  This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission  In the opener  a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human sized chessboard  a dagger protruding from a target on his back  Steed and Mrs  Peel  dressed in her trademark leather catsuit  walk up to the body as the voice over explains   Extraordinary crimes against the people  and the state  have to be avenged by agents extraordinary  Two such people are John Steed  top professional  and his partner Emma Peel  talented amateur  Otherwise known as The Avengers   During this voice over  Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs Peel replaces her gun in her boot  They clink glasses and depart together  Fade to black and then the opening titles proper begin   In contrast to the Gale episodes  there is a lighter  comic touch in Steed and Peel s interactions with each other and their reactions to other characters and situations  Earlier series had a harder tone  with the Gale era including some quite serious espionage dramas  This almost completely disappeared as Steed and Peel visibly enjoy topping each other s witticisms  The layer of conflict with Gale – who on occasion openly resented being used by Steed  often without her permission – is absent from Steed s interaction with Peel  Also the sexual tension between Steed and Gale is quite different from the tension between Steed and Peel  In both cases  the exact relationship between the partners is left ambiguous  although they seemed to have carte blanche to visit each other s homes whenever they please  and it is not uncommon for scenes to suggest Steed had spent the night at Gale s or Peel s home  or vice versa  Although nothing  improper  is displayed  the obviously much closer chemistry between Steed and Peel constantly suggests intimacy between the two   Science fiction fantasy elements  a style later known as Spy fi  also begin to emerge in stories  The duo encounters killer robots   The Cybernauts    telepaths   Too Many Christmas Trees   and giant alien carnivorous plants   The Man Eater of Surrey Green     In her fourth episode   Death at Bargain Prices   Mrs Peel takes an undercover job at a department store  Her uniform for promoting space age toys is an elaborate leather catsuit plus silver boots  sash and welder s gloves  The suit minus the silver accessories becomes her signature outfit which she wore primarily for fight scenes in early episodes and in the titles  Some episodes contain a fetishistic undercurrent  In  A Touch of Brimstone  Mrs Peel dresses in a dominatrix outfit of corset  laced boots and spiked collar to become the  Queen of Sin    Peel s avant garde fashions  featuring bold accents and high contrast geometric patterns  emphasize her youthful  contemporary personality  She represents the modern England of the Sixties – just as Steed  with his vintage style and mannerisms  personifies Edwardian era nostalgia  According to Macnee in his book The Avengers and Me  Rigg disliked wearing leather and insisted on a new line of fabric athletic wear for the fifth series  Alun Hughes  who had designed clothing for Diana Rigg s personal wardrobe  was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel s  softer  new wardrobe  Pierre Cardin was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee  In America  TV Guide ran a four page photospread on Rigg s new  Emmapeeler  outfits  10–16 June 1967   Eight tight fitting jumpsuits in a variety of bright colours were created using the stretch fabric crimplene   Another memorable feature of the show from this point onwards was its automobiles  Steed s signature cars were vintage 1926–1928 Bentley racing or town cars  including Blower Bentleys and Bentley Speed Sixes  although  uniquely  in  The Thirteenth Hole  he drives a Vauxhall 30 98   while Peel drove a sporty Lotus Elan convertible which  like her clothes  emphasized her independence and vitality  During the first Peel series  each episode ended with a short  comedic scene of the duo leaving the scene of their most recent adventure in some unusual vehicle   1 4 1  Fifth series  After one filmed series  of 26 episodes  in black and white  The Avengers began filming in colour for the fifth series in 1966  It was three years before Britain s ITV network began full colour broadcasting  This series was broadcast in the U S  from January to May 1967  The American prologue of the previous series was rejigged for the colour episodes  It opened with the caption The Avengers In Color  required by ABC for colour series at that time   This was followed by Steed unwrapping the foil from a champagne bottle and Peel shooting the cork away   Unlike the  chessboard  opening of the previous series  this new prologue was also included in UK broadcasts of the series    The first 16 episodes of the fifth series begin with Peel receiving a call to duty message from Steed   Mrs Peel  we re needed   Peel was conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift  at which point Steed suddenly appeared  usually in her apartment   The messages were delivered by Steed in increasingly bizarre ways as the series progressed  in a newspaper Peel had just bought  or on traffic lights while she was out driving  On one occasion Steed appeared on her television set  interrupting an old science fiction movie  actually clips from their Year Four episode  The Cybernauts   to call her to work  Another way Steed contacted her was in the beginning of episode 13   A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Station  when she enters her flat and sees a Meccano Percy the Small Engine going around a circular track with a note on one of the train cars that says  Mrs  Peel  in bold letters  she then walks over to Steed who says   You re needed   At the start of  The Hidden Tiger  Peel is redecorating her apartment  wearing a jumpsuit and drinking champagne   she peels off a strip of wallpaper  revealing the words  Mrs Peel  painted on the wall beneath  She turns to see Steed in the apartment removing another strip of wallpaper  revealing  We re needed  painted underneath on another wall  In another instance Emma enters Steed s flat to find he has just fallen down the stairs  and he painfully gasps   Mrs Peel  you re needed   Often the episode s tag scene returned to the situation of the  Mrs Peel  we re needed  scene   The Hidden Tiger  returns to the partially redecorated apartment where Steed begins painting a love heart and arrow and the initials of two people on the wall  but paints over the initials when Peel sees his graffito  In  The Superlative Seven  the call to duty and the tag both involve a duck shooting situation where unexpected items fall from the sky after shots are fired   The series also introduced a comic tag line caption to the episode title  using the format of  Steed  does this   Emma  does that    For example  The Joker  had the opening caption   Steed trumps an ace  Emma plays a lone hand    The Joker  was to a large extent a re write colour episode of the earlier Cathy Gale b w era story   Don t Look Behind You   as were a few other later episodes re writes in colour of b w era tales    The  Mrs Peel  we re needed  scenes and the alternate tag lines were dropped after the first 16 episodes  after a break in production  for financial reasons  They were deemed by the U K  networks as disposable if The Avengers was to return to ITV screens   Dave Rogers  book The Avengers Anew lists a set for every Steed Peel episode except  The Forget Me Knot     Stories were increasingly characterized by a futuristic  science fiction bent  with mad scientists and their creations wreaking havoc  The duo dealt with being shrunk to doll size   Mission    Highly Improbable    pet cats being electrically altered into ferocious and lethal  miniature tigers    The Hidden Tiger    killer automata   Return of The Cybernauts    mind transferring machines   Who s Who       and invisible foes   The See Through Man     The series parodied its American contemporaries with episodes such as  The Girl From AUNTIE    Mission    Highly Improbable  and  The Winged Avenger   spoofing The Man from U N C L E   Mission  Impossible and Batman  respectively   The show still carried the basic format – Steed and his associate were charged with solving the problem in the space of a 50 minute episode  thus preserving the safety of 1960s Britain   Comedy was evident in the names and acronyms of the organizations  For example  in  The Living Dead   two rival groups examine reported ghost sightings  FOG  Friends Of Ghosts  and SMOG  Scientific Measurement Of Ghosts    The Hidden Tiger  features the Philanthropic Union for Rescue  Relief and Recuperation of Cats—PURRR—led by characters named Cheshire  Manx  and Angora   The series also occasionally adopted a metafictional tone  coming close to breaking the fourth wall  In the series 5 episode  Something Nasty in the Nursery  Peel directly references the series  storytelling convention of having potentially helpful sources of information killed off just before she or Steed arrive  This then occurs a few minutes later  In the tag scene for the same episode  Steed and Peel tell viewers – indirectly – to tune in next week   For this series Diana Rigg s stunt double was stuntwoman Cyd Child  though stuntman Peter Elliot doubled for Rigg in a stunt dive in  The Bird Who Knew Too Much    1 4 2  Rigg s departure  Rigg was initially unhappy with the way she was treated by the show s producers  During her first series she learned she was being paid less than the camera man  She demanded a raise  to put her more on a par with her co star  or she would leave the show  The producers gave in  thanks to the show s great popularity in the US   At the end of the fifth series in 1967  Rigg left to pursue other projects  This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film  in this case On Her Majesty s Secret Service   Rigg and Macnee have remained lifelong friends   1 5  1968–69  With Tara King  Linda Thorson   When Diana Rigg left the series in October 1967  the British network executives decided that the current series formula  despite resulting in popular success  could not be pursued further  Thus they decided that a  return to realism  was appropriate for the sixth series  1968–69   Brian Clemens and Albert Fennel were replaced by John Bryce  producer of most of the Cathy Gale era episodes   Bryce had a difficult situation in hand  He had to find a replacement for Diana Rigg and shoot the first seven episodes of the new series  which were supposed to be shipped to America together with the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes   Bryce signed his then girlfriend  20 year old newcomer Linda Thorson  as the new female costar and chose the name  Tara King  for her character  Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart  and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy and Emma  the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and King  King also differed from Steed s previous partners in that she was a fully fledged  albeit initially inexperienced  agent working for Steed s organisation  his previous partners had all been  in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series  talented amateurs  Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde  so Thorson s brown hair was bleached  However the process badly damaged Thorson s hair  so she had to wear wigs for the first third of her episodes  until her own hair grew back  Her natural brown hair was not seen until the episode  All Done with Mirrors    Production of the first seven episodes of the sixth series began  However financial problems and internal difficulties undermined Bryce s effort  He only managed to complete three episodes   Invitation to a Killing   a 90 minute episode introducing Tara King    The Great  Great Britain Crime   some of its original footage was reused in the 1969 episode  Homicide and Old Lace   and  Invasion of the Earthmen   which survived relatively intact except for the scenes in which Tara wears a brown wig    After a rough cut screening of these episodes to studio executives  Bryce was fired and Clemens and Fennel were summoned back  At their return  a fourth episode called  The Murderous Connection  was in its second day of production  After revising the script  it was renamed as  The Curious Case of the Countless Clues  and production was resumed  Production of the episode  Split    a leftover script from the Emma Peel colour series  proceeded  Two completely new episodes were also shot   Get A Way   and  Look  Stop Me If You ve Heard This One  But There Were These Two Fellers    Dennis Spooner said of the event that  Brian left The Avengers for about three episodes  someone took over  and when Brian came back  it was in a terrible state  He was faced with doing a rewrite on a film they d already shot   The episode had a story error where Steed leaves for a destination  The villains then realise this and pursue him – yet arrive there before Steed does  It was fixed by having a character ask Steed  What took you so long    to which he replies  I came the pretty way    You can only do that on The Avengers you see  It was just my favourite show to work on    Clemens and Fennel decided to film a new episode to introduce Tara King  This  the third episode filmed for the sixth series  was titled  The Forget Me Knot  and bade farewell to Emma Peel and introduced her successor  a trained but inexperienced agent named Tara King  It would be broadcast as the first episode of the sixth series  Tara debuts in dynamic style  when Steed is called to Headquarters  he is attacked and knocked down by trainee agent King who mistakes him for her training partner   No farewell scenes for Emma Peel had been shot when Diana Rigg left the series  Rigg was recalled for  The Forget Me Knot   through which Emma acts as Steed s partner as usual  Rigg also filmed a farewell scene for Emma which appeared as the tag scene of the episode  It was explained that Emma s husband  Peter Peel  was found alive and rescued  and she left the British secret service to be with him  Emma visits Steed to say goodbye  and while leaving she passes Tara on the stairway giving the advice that  He likes his tea stirred anti clockwise   Steed looks out the window as a departing Emma enters the Bentley driven by Peter – who from a distance seems to resemble Steed  and was played by Patrick Macnee  wearing a bowler hat and umbrella    Bryce s original episode introducing Tara   Invitation to a Killing   was revised as a regular 60 minute episode named  Have Guns Will Haggle   These episodes  together with  Invasion of the Earthmen  and the last eight Peel colour episodes  were shipped to America in February 1968   For this series the government official who gave Steed his orders was depicted on screen  Mother  introduced in  The Forget Me Knot   is a man in a wheelchair  The role was taken by Patrick Newell who had played different roles in two earlier episodes  most recently in series five  Mother s headquarters would shift from place to place  including one episode where his complete office was on the top level of a double decker bus   Several James Bond films of the 1970s would make use of a similar gimmick for Bond s briefings    Added later as a regular was Mother s mute Amazonian assistant  Rhonda  Rhonda Parker   There was one appearance by an agency official code named  Father   a blind older woman played by Iris Russell   Russell had appeared in the series several times previously in other roles   In one episode   Killer   Steed is paired with Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney  Jennifer Croxton  while King is on holiday   Scriptwriter Dennis Spooner later reflected on this series   When I wrote  Look  Stop Me If You ve Heard This One  But There Were These Two Fellers   that was definitely the last series  They were going to make no more  so in that series we went right over the top  we went really weird  because they knew there weren t going to be any more    Spooner said the series  worked because it became a parody on itself  almost  You can only do that so long   Overall he attributes the success of the show to its light approach   We spoofed everything  we took Mission  Impossible  Bad Day at Black Rock  High Noon  The Dirty Dozen  The Birds    we took them all  The film buffs used to love it  There were always lines in it that people knew what we were talking about    Vehicle wise  Steed continued to drive vintage green Bentleys in the first seven episodes in production  His regular transport for the remainder of the series were two yellow Rolls Royce cars  Mother also occasionally appeared in silver Rolls Royces  Tara King drove an AC 428 and a Lotus Europa  Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney drove an MGC Roadster   The revised series continued to be broadcast in America  The episodes with Linda Thorson as King proved to be highly rated in Europe and the UK  In the United States however  the ABC network that carried the series chose to air it opposite the number one show in the country at the time  Rowan and Martin s Laugh In  Steed and King could not compete  and the show was cancelled in the US  Without this vital commercial backing  production could not continue in Britain either  and the series ended in May 1969  The final scene of the final episode   Bizarre   has Steed and King  champagne glasses in hand  accidentally launching themselves into orbit aboard a rocket  as Mother breaks the fourth wall and says to the audience   They ll be back   before adding in shock   They re unchaperoned up there    2  Music  The 1961 series featured a jazz influenced theme by John Dankworth  Library music was used sparsely as a soundtrack  sometimes with variations based on the main theme  Dankworth s theme music was reworked for the third series  Dankworth s first theme was recorded on the Columbia label  on a 45rpm single  and a new recording  similar to the reworked television theme was issued on Fontana in 1963  A very faithful cover version was released by Johnny Gregory   When Rigg joined the series in 1965  new theme music by Laurie Johnson was introduced  This was based on a previously released title  on LP called  The Shake   For the colour series  1967   a percussion section was added  to accompany the new teaser sequence at the start of each episode  Johnson re scored the theme when Linda Thorson joined the series  adding a counter melody on trumpet  based on the leitmotif for Tara King from the final Rigg episode  The Forget Me Knot   The new theme debuted in the closing titles of the episode  The Forget Me Knot   which introduced Thorson  It was altogether more dynamic  and included a much more frenetic percussion section  for the revised teaser sequence  Importantly  the filmed episodes contained specially composed scores by Johnson  To accompany Steed s request  Mrs Peel – you re needed    he composed a brief  sting   and there was also a special theme for  Emma   For the  Thorson  series  a characteristic piece was composed to accompany the tag scene  at the end of each episode  Many of the most memorable cues from the Rigg Thorson series  including the opening  and closing titles themes  and the  Tag Scene  were released commercially on CD in 2009   Owing to a professional commitment to score for the film Hot Millions  starring Peter Ustinov  and Maggie Smith   Johnson requested assistance from his keyboard player  Howard Blake  who scored some of the episodes of the final season  as well as additional music for other episodes which Johnson did not have time to complete  These were composed in a style remarkably similar to Johnson s  probably by request  or a sense of allegiance  In 2011  to mark the 50th anniversary of the series  these almost complete scores by Blake  including Johnson s main  and end titles themes  were issued on a double CD set  Of the original Johnson theme  countless cover versions have been released on vinyl and CD  and the opening motif was retained on the series The New Avengers   Johnson subsequently collaborated with Clemens on other projects  including the theme for The New Avengers   3  Production team  Sydney Newman  who would later go on to spearhead the creation of Doctor Who for the BBC  never received screen credit as the creator of The Avengers  In his memoir  The Avengers and Me  Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about this  Newman explained that he never sought on screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  such credits were not given  and he never thought to get one for The Avengers   The production team changed during the series  long run  particularly between the third and fourth series  but the influence of Brian Clemens was felt throughout  He wrote the second episode and became the series  most prolific scriptwriter  Succeeding producers Leonard White and John Bryce  Julian Wintle became the producer of the 4th series with Brian Clemens credited as Associate Producer and Albert Fennell credited as  In charge of production   Series 5  made by A B C  Television Films   which was created during the run up to Associated British Corporation and Associated Redifussion forming Thames TV  Clemens and Fennell became co producers  with Wintle as Executive Producer  For series 6  after its first producer John Bryce left  Clemens and Fennell returned as co producers  early episodes also credit Julian Wintle as Consultant to the series and Philip Levene as Story Consultant   Ray Austin became the fight arranger for series 4 and 5  introducing kung fu to the series  Later he became a prolific television director  Joe Dunne took over for series 6   4  Reception in North America  Although telerecordings of the second and third series were seen in Canada as early as 1963  these two series  the first series was not sold overseas  of The Avengers were not broadcast on television in the United States  These series were shot in the studio on 405 line video using a multicamera setup  Episodes were often performed live to tape on the day they were to be transmitted and there was little provision for retakes  Seven episodes of the first series were actually performed live  With few retakes  these early episodes were fraught with technical errors  The episode  Immortal Clay  features a visible camera shake  In  School for Traitors  Julie Stevens stumbles over her dialogue when introducing Steed to someone  prompting Macnee to ad lib a joke to cover the error   In contrast 1960s US prime time drama television productions were shot on film using the single camera method  Retakes allowed obvious errors to be corrected in these productions  As they were originated on film  the editing techniques were far superior to those available for 405 line videotape  The 1965 sale of The Avengers to United States television prompted a change in production style to the single camera shooting method  originated on 35 mm film   The more relaxed standards of British media would have required some moments to be censored in the U S  In  Mr Teddy Bear  Steed strips down to his underwear for decontamination  In  Death Dispatch  Gale is seen wearing a black lace brassiere   The series  stunt man and stunt arranger Ray Austin expressed the opinion that the show s violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States  There The Avengers was given a late timeslot due to its violence   They did that with the first Avengers here  in the U S    with Diana Rigg  They put us on at 11 30 pm on CBS   because it was too violent   Austin goes on to explain that U S  television follows a  different code   Austin said that on The Avengers  we were determined to do the show our way  the English way  and no one was going to stop us  And  indeed  no one did stop us  We never  never got to prime time  And it was our own faults  because we would not comply to the Midwest  That s where the money comes from in this country  nowhere else  Forget Los Angeles  forget New York—you have to aim for the Midwest  If the Midwest watches your show  you ve made it   In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10 00 pm on ABC  The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7 30 pm  also on ABC   American censors objected to some content  in particular the episode  A Touch of Brimstone  which featured a modern day version of the Hellfire Club and climaxed with Emma being dressed in a skimpy corset costume with spiked collar and high heel boots to become the Queen of Sin  and being attacked with a whip by guest star Peter Wyngarde  The American broadcast network refused to air it  In total five episodes from the first Emma Peel series were not initially broadcast by ABC  These were   A Surfeit of H2O    Silent Dust   which featured Emma being attacked with a horsewhip    Quick Quick Slow Death    A Touch of Brimstone  and  Honey for the Prince   in which Emma performed the dance of the seven veils   although they were seen in later syndicated repeats   Earlier Cathy Gale and Venus Smith episodes had aired in Canada before the arrival of Mrs  Peel  U S  audiences saw the 1962–1964 Gale and Smith episodes of the series for the first time in the early 1990s when they were broadcast on the A&E Network  No Keel episode of the series repeatedly was ever broadcast outside Britain  and even in the UK only one episode   The Frighteners   was rebroadcast  as part of a run of classic episodes on Channel 4 in early 1993  otherwise mostly consisting of Gale episodes    Reruns of The Avengers now currently air on the NBCUniversal owned digital subchannel network Cozi TV   5  Episodes  Six series of The Avengers were made between 1961 and 1969  There was an enforced break in filming and transmission towards the end of series five due to financial problems  Television researcher Andrew Pixley and authors Paul Cornell  Martin Day and Keith Topping in their book The Avengers Dossier  The Unauthorised and Unofficial Guide consider the last eight episodes produced after the break as constituting a short series six  and therefore count seven series in total  Within the internal production of The Avengers the last eight episodes were considered to be a continuation of series five   6  Episode copies and DVDs  All original videotapes from series one  two and three  which were shot on video  were wiped   Only two complete episodes from the show s first series are known to exist  as 16mm film telerecordings  These are  The Frighteners   an extract of which is playing on a television in the film Quadrophenia  and  Girl on the Trapeze   which was found in the UCLA Film and Television Archive via an internet search of their on line database  Part of the show s first episode was found in the United States  The footage is of the episode s first 21 minutes  up to the first commercial break   All series two and three episodes survive as 16mm telerecordings  These have been released to DVD  as have all of the Emma Peel and Tara King episodes  which were shot on film  The two surviving complete Keel episodes  plus the remnant of the first episode  have also been released in the UK and US  but are not currently available in the US   7  The New Avengers  The sustained popularity of the Tara King episodes in France led to a 1975 French television advertisement for a brand of champagne with Thorson and Macnee reprising their roles  The advertisement s success spurred financing interest in France for new episodes of The Avengers   The result was a new series  The New Avengers  Patrick Macnee reprised the role of Steed  with two new partners  Mike Gambit  Gareth Hunt  and Purdey  Joanna Lumley   It aired on ITV in the UK in 1976–1977  CTV in Canada  CBS in the United States  in 1978 79  and TF1 in France  series 1 in 1976–1977 and series 2 in 1979   The final four episodes were almost completely produced by Canadian interests and were filmed there  In some markets they carried the title The New Avengers in Canada   8  Spin offs  8 1  Novels  A number of original novels based on the series were published in the 1960s  The first by Douglas Enefer  published by Consul Books  was the only 60s novel to feature Cathy Gale  In the UK  Panther books published four novels written by John Garforth featuring Emma Peel in 1967  These were reprinted in the US by Berkley Medallion books  After Panther stopped publishing Avengers
