Varney the Vampire  or  the Feast of Blood was a Victorian era serialized gothic horror story by James Malcolm Rymer  alternatively attributed to Thomas Preskett Prest   It first appeared in 1845–47 as a series of cheap pamphlets of the kind then known as  penny dreadfuls   The story was published in book form in 1847  It is of epic length  the original edition ran to 876 double columned pages divided into 220 chapters  Altogether it totals nearly 667 000 words  Despite its inconsistencies  Varney the Vampire is more or less a cohesive whole  It introduced many of the tropes present in vampire fiction recognizable to modern audiences to this day   1  The story  1 1  Setting  The story has a confused setting  While ostensibly set in the early eighteenth century  there are references to the Napoleonic Wars and other indicators that the story is contemporary to the time of its writing in the mid nineteenth century  Varney s adventures also occur in various locations including London  Bath  Winchester  Naples and Venice   1 2  Human characters  The plot concerns the troubles that Sir Francis Varney inflicts upon the Bannerworths  a formerly wealthy family driven to ruin by their recently deceased father  Initially the Bannerworths consist of Mrs  Bannerworth and her adult children Henry  George and Flora   George is never mentioned after the thirty sixth chapter   A family friend  Mr  Marchdale  lives with the Bannerworths in early chapters  Later Flora s fiancé Charles Holland and his seafaring uncle Admiral Bell along with his assistant  the extremely humorous Jack Pringle  also take residence with the Bannerworths   1 3  The character of Varney  Though the earliest chapters give the standard motives of blood sustenance for Varney s actions toward the family  later ones suggest that Varney is motivated by monetary interests  The story is at times inconsistent and confusing  as if the author did not know whether to make Varney a literal vampire or simply a human who acts like one  Varney bears a strong resemblance to a portrait in Bannerworth Hall  and the implication throughout is that he is actually Marmaduke Bannerworth  a k a  Sir Runnagate Bannerworth in a classic naming confusion   but that connection is never cleared up  He is portrayed as loathing his condition  and at one point he turns Clara Crofton  a member of another family he terrorizes  into a vampire for revenge   Over the course of the book  Varney is presented with increasing sympathy as a victim of circumstances  He tries to save himself  but is unable to do so  He ultimately commits suicide by throwing himself into Mount Vesuvius  after having left a written account of his origin with a sympathetic priest  According to Varney  he was cursed with vampirism after he had betrayed a royalist to Oliver Cromwell and accidentally killed his own son afterwards in a fit of anger  although he  dies  and is revived several times in the course of his career  This afforded the author a variety of origin stories  In one of these  a medical student named Dr  Chillingworth applies galvanism to Varney s hanged corpse and revives him  This sub plot has an obvious similarity to the story of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and even more so  perhaps  to much later film adaptations of the novel  the novel itself does not present electricity as Dr  Frankenstein s means of creating the monster    2  Legacy  Varney was a major influence on later vampire fiction  most notably the renowned novel Dracula  1897  by Bram Stoker  Many of today s standard vampire tropes originated in Varney  Varney has fangs  leaves two puncture wounds on the necks of his victims  has hypnotic powers  and has superhuman strength  Unlike later fictional vampires  he is able to go about in daylight and has no particular fear of either crosses or garlic  He can eat and drink in human fashion as a form of disguise  but he points out that human food and drink do not agree with him  His vampirism seems to be a fit that comes on him when his vital energy begins to run low  he is a regular  normally functioning person between feedings   This is also the first example of the  sympathetic vampire   a vampire who despises his condition but is nonetheless a slave to it  This archetype has been widely exemplified  notably by such characters as Countess Zaleska in the 1936 film Dracula s Daughter  Barnabas Collins in the TV soap opera Dark Shadows  Mick St  John in the TV show Moonlight  Louis de Pointe du Lac in Anne Rice s Interview with the Vampire  Kain in the Legacy Of Kain video games  Marvel Comics character Morbius  the Living Vampire  Nick Knight in the TV series Forever Knight  Angel from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer universe  and Bill Compton in Charlaine Harris  The Southern Vampire Mysteries   The makers of Marvel Comics were also influenced by this story  In the Marvel Universe   Varnae  is the name of the first vampire  created by the people of Atlantis before it sank   A standard joking phrase  common today in Northern England  is possibly first recorded in Varney  where a comical character twice describes himself as having  never been backward in coming forward    The sole member of the German darkwave band Sopor Aeternus & The Ensemble of Shadows  Anna Varney Cantodea  adopted her name from Varney the vampire   The Shadow magazine story  The Vampire Murders  published in 1942 features  Varney Haldrew  who lives in Haldrew Hall  Varney is named after the original Varney The Vampire and spends his nights sleeping in a coffin   Varney appears in an episode of the Canadian television show Dracula  The Series  played by Sam Malkin  He appears in the episode  Bad Blood   and treats Dracula after he is poisoned by a rare blood type   Sir Francis Varney is the Viceroy of India in Kim Newman s Anno Dracula   In the TV series Penny Dreadful  2014   Dr  Van Helsing gives a copy of Varney the Vampire to Victor Frankenstein  explaining that the story is more truth than fiction and that the mysterious creature the series  characters are pursuing is a vampire   3  Footnotes  4  References  E S  Turner s Boys Will be Boys
