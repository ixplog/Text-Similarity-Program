Lake Ladoga   or    earlier in Finnish Nevajärvi       is a freshwater lake located in the Republic of Karelia and Leningrad Oblast in northwestern Russia just outside the outskirts of Saint Petersburg  It is the largest lake in Europe  and the 15th largest freshwater lake by area in the world   1  Etymology  In one of Nestor s chronicles from the 12th century he mentions a lake called  the Great Nevo   a clear link to the Neva River  also compare  bog  quagmire    In ancient Norse sagas and Hanseatic treaties they mention a city made of lakes called Aldoga  compare   wave    Since the beginning of the 14th century the name of the lake was commonly called Ladoga  which was named after the city of Ladoga which in turn was named after the eponymous inflow in the lower reaches of the Volkhov River     river in the low areas   Other theories about the origin of the name comes from   wave  here   wavy  from the Russian dialectal word алодь  meaning open lake  extensive water field   According to Jackson  T N    So far it can be considered that almost for granted  that the name of Ladoga first referred to the river  then the city  and only then the lake   Therefore  it considers the primary hydronym Ladoga  from  the lower river   From the river was the city   and already it was borrowed Slavic population and transformed using metathesis ald → lad from   The Old Norse intermediary word between Finnish and Old Russian word is fully confirmed by archeology  the Scandinavians first appeared in Ladoga in the early 750 s  that is  a couple of decades before the Slavs   Eugene Helimski by contrast  offers an etymology rooted in German  In his opinion  the primary name of the lake    old source   similar to the open sea  the Old Open Sea Like Source   This hydronym is associated with the name of the Neva River  which flows from Lake Ladoga  which comes German   the  new   Through the intermediate form *Aldaugja word gave  Ladoga  city     2  Geography  The lake has an average surface area of 17 891 km²  excluding the islands   Its north to south length is 219 km and its average width is 83 km  the average depth is 51 m  although it reaches a maximum of 230 m in the north western part  Basin area  276 000 km²  volume  837 km³  earlier estimated as 908 km³    There are around 660 islands  with a total area of about 435 km²  Ladoga is  on average  5 m above sea level  Most of the islands  including the famous Valaam archipelago  Kilpola and Konevets  are situated in the northwest of the lake   Separated from the Baltic Sea by the Karelian Isthmus  it drains into the Gulf of Finland via the Neva River   Lake Ladoga is navigable  being a part of the Volga Baltic Waterway connecting the Baltic Sea with the Volga River  The Ladoga Canal bypasses the lake in the southern part  connecting the Neva to the Svir   The basin of Lake Ladoga includes about 50 000 lakes and 3 500 rivers longer than 10 km  About 85% of the water inflow is due to tributaries  13% is due to precipitation  and 2% is due to underground waters   Ladoga Lacus  a methane lake on Saturns Moon Titan is named after the lake   2 1  Maps  Image la2 demis ladoga png Map

glaciation took place in the Lake Ladoga basin between 12 500 and 11 500 radiocarbon years BP  Lake Ladoga was initially part of the Baltic Ice Lake  70–80 m  above present sea level   a historical freshwater stage of Baltic Sea  It is possible  though not certain  that Ladoga was isolated from it during regression of the subsequent Yoldia Sea brackish stage  10 200–9 500 BP   The isolation threshold should be at Heinjoki to the east of Vyborg  where the Baltic Sea and Ladoga were connected by a strait or a river outlet at least until the formation of the River Neva  and possibly even much later  until the 12th century AD or so   At 9 500 BP  Lake Onega  previously draining into the White Sea  started emptying into Ladoga via the River Svir  Between 9 500 and 9 100 BP  during the transgression of Ancylus Lake  the next freshwater stage of the Baltic  Ladoga certainly became part of it  even if they hadn t been connected immediately before  During the Ancylus Lake subsequent regression  around 8 800 BP Ladoga became isolated   Ladoga slowly transgressed in its southern part due to uplift of the Baltic Shield in the north  It has been hypothesized  but not proven  that waters of the Litorina Sea  the next brackish water stage of the Baltic  occasionally invaded Ladoga between 7 000 and 5 000 BP  Around 5 000 BP the waters of the Saimaa Lake penetrated Salpausselkä and formed a new outlet  River Vuoksi  entering Lake Ladoga in the northwestern corner and raising its level by 1–2 m   The River Neva originated when the Ladoga waters at last broke through the threshold at Porogi into the lower portions of Izhora River  then a tributary of the Gulf of Finland  between 4 000 and 2 000 BP  According to some new data  it happened at 3 100 radiocarbon years BP  3 410–3 250 calendar years BP    4  Wildlife  The Ladoga is rich with fish  48 forms  species and infraspecific taxa  of fish have been encountered in the lake  including roach  carp bream  zander  European perch  ruffe  endemic variety of smelt  two varieties of Coregonus albula  vendace   eight varieties of Coregonus lavaretus  a number of other Salmonidae as well as  albeit rarely  endangered European sea sturgeon  Commercial fishing was once a major industry but has been hurt by overfishing  After the war  between 1945–1954  the total annual catch increased and reached a maximum of 4 900 tonnes  However  unbalanced fishery led to the drastic decrease of catch in 1955–1963  sometimes to 1 600 tonnes per year  Trawling has been forbidden in Lake Ladoga since 1956 and some other restrictions were imposed  The situation gradually recovered  and in 1971–1990 the catch ranged between 4 900 and 6 900 tonnes per year  about the same level as the total catch in 1938  Fish farms and recreational fishing are developing   It has its own endemic Ringed Seal subspecies known as the Ladoga Seal   Since the beginning of the 1960s Ladoga has become considerably eutrophicated   Nizhnesvirsky Natural Reserve is situated along the shore of Lake Ladoga immediately to the north of the mouth of the River Svir   5  History  In the Middle Ages  the lake formed a vital part of the Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks  with the Norse emporium at Staraya Ladoga defending the mouth of the Volkhov since the 8th century  In the course of the Swedish Novgorodian Wars  the area was disputed between the Novgorod Republic and Sweden  In the early 14th century  the fortresses of Korela  Kexholm  and Oreshek  Nöteborg  were established along the banks of the lake   The ancient Valaam Monastery was founded on the island of Valaam  the largest in Lake Ladoga  abandoned between 1611–1715  magnificently restored in the 18th century  and evacuated to Finland during the Winter War in 1940  In 1989 the monastic activities in the Valaam were resumed  Other historic cloisters in the vicinity are the Konevets Monastery  which sits on the Konevets island  and the Alexander Svirsky Monastery  which preserves fine samples of medieval Muscovite architecture   During the Ingrian War  a fraction of the Ladoga coast was occupied by Sweden  In 1617  by the Treaty of Stolbovo  the northern and western coast was ceded by Russia to Sweden  In 1721  after the Great Northern War  it was restituted to Russia by the Treaty of Nystad  Later  in 1812–1940 the lake was shared between Finland and Russia  According to the conditions of the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty militarization of the lake was severely restricted  However  both Soviet Russia and Finland had flotillas in Ladoga  see also Finnish Ladoga Naval Detachment   After the Winter War  1939–1940  according to the Moscow Peace Treaty  Ladoga  previously shared with Finland  became an internal basin of the Soviet Union   During the Continuation War  1941–1944  not only Finnish and Soviet  but also German and Italian vessels operated there  see also Naval Detachment K and Regia Marina   Under these circumstances  during much of the Siege of Leningrad  1941–1944   Lake Ladoga provided the only access to the besieged city because a section of the eastern shore remained in Soviet hands  Supplies were transported into Leningrad with trucks on winter roads over the ice  the  Road of Life   and by boat in the summer  After World War II  Finland lost the Karelia region to the USSR  and all Finnish citizens were evacuated from the ceded territory  Ladoga became an internal Soviet basin once again  The northern shore  Ladoga Karelia with the town of Sortavala  is now part of the Republic of Karelia  The western shore  Karelian Isthmus  became part of Leningrad Oblast   Since 1996 the is an annual competition for 4x4 vehicles and ATVs that travels through over 1200 kilometers of the mud  swamp and bog that surround Lake Ladoga   6  Lists  6 1  Tributaries  Svir River from Lake Onega  south east  discharge  790 m³ s    Volkhov River from Lake Ilmen  south  discharge  580 m³ s
