Management in business and organizations is the function that coordinates the efforts of people to accomplish goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively  Management comprises planning  organizing  staffing  leading or directing  and controlling an organization to accomplish the goal  Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources  financial resources  technological resources  and natural resources  Management is also an academic discipline  a social science whose objective is to study social organization   1  Etymology  The verb  manage  comes from the Italian maneggiare  to handle  especially tools   which derives from the Latin word manus  hand   The French word mesnagement  later ménagement  influenced the development in meaning of the English word management in the 17th and 18th centuries   2  Definitions  Views on the definition and scope of management include   According to Henri Fayol   to manage is to forecast and to plan  to organise  to command  to co ordinate and to control    Fredmund Malik defines it as  the transformation of resources into utility    Management included as one of the factors of production   along with machines  materials and money  Peter Drucker  1909–2005  saw the basic task of a management as twofold  marketing and innovation  Nevertheless  innovation is also linked to marketing  product innovation is a central strategic marketing issue   Peter Drucker identifies marketing as a key essence for business success  but management and marketing are generally understood as two different branches of business administration knowledge   Andreas Kaplan specifically defines European Management as a cross cultural  societal management approach based on interdisciplinary principles   Directors and managers should have the authority and responsibility to make decisions to direct an enterprise when given the authority  As a discipline  management comprises the interlocking functions of formulating corporate policy and organizing  planning  controlling  and directing a firm s resources to achieve a policy s objectives  The size of management can range from one person in a small firm to hundreds or thousands of managers in multinational companies   In large firms  the board of directors formulates the policy that the chief executive officer implements   2 1  Theoretical scope  Management involves identifying the mission  objective  procedures  rules and the manipulation of the human capital of an enterprise to contribute to the success of the enterprise  This implies effective communication  an enterprise environment  as opposed to a physical or mechanical mechanism   implies human motivation and implies some sort of successful progress or system outcome  As such  management is not the manipulation of a mechanism  machine or automated program   not the herding of animals  and can occur in both a legal as well as illegal enterprise or environment Management does not need to be seen from enterprise point of view alone  because management is an essential function to improve one s life and relationships  Management is there everywhere and it has a wider range of application  Based on this  management must have humans  communication  and a positive enterprise endeavor  Plans  measurements  motivational psychological tools  goals  and economic measures  profit  etc   may or may not be necessary components for there to be management  At first  one views management functionally  such as measuring quantity  adjusting plans  meeting goals  This applies even in situations where planning does not take place  From this perspective  Henri Fayol  1841–1925  considers management to consist of six functions   Forecasting  Planning  Organizing  Commanding  Coordinating  Controlling Henri Fayol was one of the most influential contributors to modern concepts of management   In another way of thinking  Mary Parker Follett  1868–1933   defined management as  the art of getting things done through people   She described management as philosophy   Critics  however  find this definition useful but far too narrow  The phrase  management is what managers do  occurs widely  suggesting the difficulty of defining management  the shifting nature of definitions and the connection of managerial practices with the existence of a managerial cadre or class   One habit of thought regards management as equivalent to  business administration  and thus excludes management in places outside commerce  as for example in charities and in the public sector  More broadly every organization must manage its work  people  processes  technology  etc  to maximize effectiveness  Nonetheless  many people refer to university departments that teach management as  business schools   Some institutions  such as the Harvard Business School  use that name while others  such as the Yale School of Management  employ the more inclusive term  management    English speakers may also use the term  management  or  the management  as a collective word describing the managers of an organization  for example of a corporation  Historically this use of the term often contrasted with the term  Labor    referring to those being managed   But in the present era management s use is identified in the wide areas and its frontiers have been pushed to a broader range  Apart from profitable organizations even non profitable organizations  NGO  apply management concepts  The concept and its uses are not constrained  Management on the whole is the process of planning  organizing  staffing  leading and controlling   3  Nature of managerial work  In profitable organizations  management s primary function is the satisfaction of a range of stakeholders  This typically involves making a profit  for the shareholders   creating valued products at a reasonable cost  for customers   and providing great employment opportunities for employees  In nonprofit management  add the importance of keeping the faith of donors  In most models of management and governance  shareholders vote for the board of directors  and the board then hires senior management  Some organizations have experimented with other methods  such as employee voting models  of selecting or reviewing managers  but this is rare   In the public sector of countries constituted as representative democracies  voters elect politicians to public office  Such politicians hire many managers and administrators  and in some countries like the United States political appointees lose their jobs on the election of a new president governor mayor   4  Historical development  Some see management  by definition  as late modern  in the sense of late modernity  conceptualization  On those terms it cannot have a pre modern history  only harbingers  such as stewards   Others  however  detect management like thought back to Sumerian traders and to the builders of the pyramids of ancient Egypt  Slave owners through the centuries faced the problems of exploiting motivating a dependent but sometimes unenthusiastic or recalcitrant workforce  but many pre industrial enterprises  given their small scale  did not feel compelled to face the issues of management systematically  However  innovations such as the spread of Hindu Arabic numerals  5th to 15th centuries  and the codification of double entry book keeping  1494  provided tools for management assessment  planning and control   With the changing workplaces of industrial revolutions in the 18th and 19th centuries  military theory and practice contributed approaches to managing the newly popular factories   Given the scale of most commercial operations and the lack of mechanized record keeping and recording before the industrial revolution  it made sense for most owners of enterprises in those times to carry out management functions by and for themselves  But with growing size and complexity of organizations  the split between owners  individuals  industrial dynasties or groups of shareholders  and day to day managers  independent specialists in planning and control  gradually became more common   4 1  Early writing  While management  according to some definitions  has existed for millennia  several writers have created a background of works that assisted in modern management theories   Some have been cited for lessons that civilian managers can gather  For example  Chinese general Sun Tzu in the 6th century BC  The Art of War  recommends being aware of and acting on strengths and weaknesses of both a manager s organization and a foe s   Various ancient and medieval civilizations have produced  mirrors for princes  books  which aim to advise new monarchs on how to govern  Examples include the Indian Arthashastra by Chanakya  written around 300BC   and The Prince by Italian author Niccolò Machiavelli  c  1515    Written in 1776 by Adam Smith  a Scottish moral philosopher  The Wealth of Nations discussed efficient organization of work through division of labour  Smith described how changes in processes could boost productivity in the manufacture of pins  While individuals could produce 200 pins per day  Smith analyzed the steps involved in manufacture and  with 10 specialists  enabled production of 48 000 pins per day   4 2  19th century  Classical economists such as Adam Smith  1723–1790  and John Stuart Mill  1806–1873  provided a theoretical background to resource allocation  production  and pricing issues  About the same time  innovators like Eli Whitney  1765–1825   James Watt  1736–1819   and Matthew Boulton  1728–1809  developed elements of technical production such as standardization  quality control procedures  cost accounting  interchangeability of parts  and work planning  Many of these aspects of management existed in the pre 1861 slave based sector of the US economy  That environment saw 4 million people  as the contemporary usages had it   managed  in profitable quasi mass production   Salaried managers as an identifiable group first became prominent in the late 19th century   4 3  20th century  By about 1900 one finds managers trying to place their theories on what they regarded as a thoroughly scientific basis  see scientism for perceived limitations of this belief   Examples include Henry R  Towne s Science of management in the 1890s  Frederick Winslow Taylor s The Principles of Scientific Management  1911   Frank and Lillian Gilbreth s Applied motion study  1917   and Henry L  Gantt s charts  1910s   J  Duncan wrote the first college management textbook in 1911  In 1912 Yoichi Ueno introduced Taylorism to Japan and became first management consultant of the  Japanese management style   His son Ichiro Ueno pioneered Japanese quality assurance   The first comprehensive theories of management appeared around 1920  The Harvard Business School offered the first Master of Business Administration degree  MBA  in 1921  People like Henri Fayol  1841–1925  and Alexander Church described the various branches of management and their inter relationships  In the early 20th century  people like Ordway Tead  1891–1973   Walter Scott and J  Mooney applied the principles of psychology to management  Other writers  such as Elton Mayo  1880–1949   Mary Parker Follett  1868–1933   Chester Barnard  1886–1961   Max Weber  1864–1920  who saw what he called the  administrator  as bureaucrat   Rensis Likert  1903–1981   and Chris Argyris  * 1923  approached the phenomenon of management from a sociological perspective   Peter Drucker  1909–2005  wrote one of the earliest books on applied management  Concept of the Corporation  published in 1946   It resulted from Alfred Sloan  chairman of General Motors until 1956  commissioning a study of the organisation  Drucker went on to write 39 books  many in the same vein   H  Dodge  Ronald Fisher  1890–1962   and Thornton C  Fry introduced statistical techniques into management studies  In the 1940s  Patrick Blackett worked in the development of the applied mathematics science of operations research  initially for military operations  Operations research  sometimes known as  management science   but distinct from Taylor s scientific management   attempts to take a scientific approach to solving decision problems  and can apply directly to multiple management problems  particularly in the areas of logistics and operations   Some of the more developments include the Theory of Constraints  management by objectives  reengineering  Six Sigma and various information technology driven theories such as agile software development  as well as group management theories such as Cog s Ladder   As the general recognition of managers as a class solidified during the 20th century and gave perceived practitioners of the art science of management a certain amount of prestige  so the way opened for popularised systems of management ideas to peddle their wares  In this context many management fads may have had more to do with pop psychology than with scientific theories of management   Towards the end of the 20th century  business management came to consist of six separate branches  namely   financial management  human resource management  information technology management  responsible for management information systems   marketing management  operations management or production management  strategic management  4 4  21st century  In the 21st century observers find it increasingly difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way  More and more processes simultaneously involve several categories  Instead  one tends to think in terms of the various processes  tasks  and objects subject to management   Branches of management theory also exist relating to nonprofits and to government  such as public administration  public management  and educational management  Further  management programs related to civil society organizations have also spawned programs in nonprofit management and social entrepreneurship   Note that many of the assumptions made by management have come under attack from business ethics viewpoints  critical management studies  and anti corporate activism   As one consequence  workplace democracy  sometimes referred to as Workers  self management  has become both more common and advocated to a greater extent  in some places distributing all management functions among workers  each of whom takes on a portion of the work  However  these models predate any current political issue  and may occur more naturally than does a command hierarchy  All management embraces to some degree a democratic principle—in that in the long term  the majority of workers must support management  Otherwise  they leave to find other work or go on strike  Despite the move toward workplace democracy  command and control organization structures remain commonplace as de facto organization structure  Indeed  the entrenched nature of command and control is evident in the way that recent layoffs have been conducted with management ranks affected far less than employees at the lower levels  In some cases  management has even rewarded itself with bonuses after laying off lower level workers   According to leadership academic Manfred F R  Kets de Vries  a contemporary senior management team will almost inevitably have some personality disorders   5  Topics  5 1  Basic functions  Management operates through five basic functions  planning  organizing  coordinating  commanding  and controlling   Planning  Deciding what needs to happen in the future and generating plans for action deciding in advance    Organizing  Making sure the human and nonhuman resources are put into place  Coordinating  Creating a structure through which an organization s goals can be accomplished   Commanding  Determining what must be done in a situation and getting people to do it   Controlling  Checking progress against plans   5 2  Basic roles  Interpersonal  roles that involve coordination and interaction with employees  Informational  roles that involve handling  sharing  and analyzing information  Decision  roles that require decision making Managerial Skills  Political  used to build a power base and establish connections  Conceptual  used to analyze complex situations   Interpersonal  used to communicate  motivate  mentor and delegate  Diagnostic  ability to visualize most appropriate response to a situation  Leadership  ability to lead and provide guidance to a specific group  Technical  Expertise in one s particular functional area   5 3  Formation of the business policy  The mission of the business is the most obvious purpose—which may be  for example  to make soap   The vision of the business reflects its aspirations and specifies its intended direction or future destination   The objectives of the business refers to the ends or activity that is the goal of a certain task   The business s policy is a guide that stipulates rules  regulations and objectives  and may be used in the managers  decision making  It must be flexible and easily interpreted and understood by all employees   The business s strategy refers to the coordinated plan of action it takes and resources it uses to realize its vision and long term objectives  It is a guideline to managers  stipulating how they ought to allocate and use the factors of production to the business s advantage  Initially  it could help the managers decide on what type of business they want to form   5 3 1  Implementation of policies and strategies  All policies and strategies must be discussed with all managerial personnel and staff   Managers must understand where and how they can implement their policies and strategies   A plan of action must be devised for each department   Policies and strategies must be reviewed regularly   Contingency plans must be devised in case the environment changes   Top level managers should carry out regular progress assessments   The business requires team spirit and a good environment   The missions  objectives  strengths and weaknesses of each department must be analyzed to determine their roles in achieving the business s mission   The forecasting method develops a reliable picture of the business s future environment   A planning unit must be created to ensure that all plans are consistent and that policies and strategies are aimed at achieving the same mission and objectives  All policies must be discussed with all managerial personnel and staff that is required in the execution of any departmental policy   Organizational change is strategically achieved through the implementation of the eight step plan of action established by John P  Kotter  Increase urgency  get the vision right  communicate the buy in  empower action  create short term wins  don t let up  and make change stick   5 3 2  Policies and strategies in the planning process  They give mid and lower level managers a good idea of the future plans for each department in an organization   A framework is created whereby plans and decisions are made   Mid and lower level management may add their own plans to the business s strategies   5 4  Levels  Most organizations have three management levels  first level  middle level  and top level managers  These managers are classified in a hierarchy of authority  and perform different tasks  In many organizations  the number of managers in every level resembles a pyramid  Each level is explained below in specifications of their different responsibilities and likely job titles   5 4 1  Top level management  The top consists of the board of directors  including non executive directors and executive directors   president  vice president  CEOs and other members of the C level executives  They are responsible for controlling and overseeing the entire organization  They set a tone at the top and develop strategic plans  company policies  and make decisions on the direction of the business  In addition  top level managers play a significant role in the mobilization of outside resources and are accountable to the shareholders and general public   The board of directors is typically primarily composed of non executives which owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders and are not closely involved in the day to day activities of the organization  although this varies depending on the type  e g   public versus private   size and culture of the organization  These directors are theoretically liable for breaches of that duty and typically insured under directors and officers liability insurance  Fortune 500 directors are estimated to spend 4 4 hours per week on board duties  and median compensation was $212 512 in 2010  The board sets corporate strategy  makes major decisions such as major acquisitions  and hires  evaluates  and fires the top level manager  Chief Executive Officer or CEO  and the CEO typically hires other positions  However  board involvement in the hiring of other positions such as the Chief Financial Officer  CFO  has increased  In 2013  a survey of over 160 CEOs and directors of public and private companies found that the top weaknesses of CEOs were  mentoring skills  and  board engagement   and 10% of companies never evaluated the CEO  The board may also have certain employees  e g   internal auditors  report to them or directly hire independent contractors  for example  the board  through the audit committee  typically selects the auditor   Helpful skills of top management vary by the type of organization but typically include a broad understanding competition  world economies  and politics  In addition  the CEO is responsible for executing and determining  within the board s framework  the broad policies of the organization  Executive management accomplishes the day to day details  including  instructions for preparation of department budgets  procedures  schedules  appointment of middle level executives such as department managers  coordination of departments  media and governmental relations  and shareholder communication   5 4 2  Middle level managers  Consist of general managers  branch managers and department managers  They are accountable to the top management for their department s function  They devote more time to organizational and directional functions  Their roles can be emphasized as executing organizational plans in conformance with the company s policies and the objectives of the top management  they define and discuss information and policies from top management to lower management  and most importantly they inspire and provide guidance to lower level managers towards better performance   Middle management is the midway management of a categorized organization  being secondary to the senior management but above the deepest levels of operational members  An operational manager may be well thought out the middle management  or may be categorized as non management operate  liable to the policy of the specific organization  Efficiency of the middle level is vital in any organization  since they bridge the gap between top level and bottom level staffs   Their functions include   Design and implement effective group and inter group work and information systems   Define and monitor group level performance indicators   Diagnose and resolve problems within and among work groups   Design and implement reward systems that support cooperative behavior  They also make decision and share ideas with top managers   5 4 3  First level managers  Consist of supervisors  section leaders  foremen  etc  They focus on controlling and directing  They usually have the responsibility of assigning employees tasks  guiding and supervising employees on day to day activities  ensuring quality and quantity production  making recommendations  suggestions  and up channeling employee problems  etc  First level managers are role models for employees that provide   Basic supervision  Motivation  Career planning  Performance feedback  5 5  Training  Universities around the world  offer bachelor s and advanced degrees  diplomas and certificates in management  generally within their colleges of business and business schools but also in other related departments  There is also an increase in online management education and training in the form of electronic educational technology   also called e learning    5 5 1  United States of America  At the graduate level students may choose to specialize in major subareas of management such as entrepreneurship  human resources  international business  organizational behavior  organizational theory  strategic management  accounting  corporate finance  entertainment  global management  healthcare management  investment management  Leaders in Sustainability and real estate  6
