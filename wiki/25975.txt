The Reign of Terror  5 September 1793 – 28 July 1794   also known as The Terror     was a period of violence that occurred after the onset of the French Revolution  incited by conflict between rival political factions  the Girondins and the Mountains  and marked by mass executions of  enemies of the revolution   The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands  with 16 594 executed by guillotine  2 639 in Paris   and another 25 000 in summary executions across France   The guillotine  called the  National Razor   became the symbol of the revolutionary cause  strengthened by a string of executions  King Louis XVI  Marie Antoinette  the Girondins  Philippe Égalité  Louis Philippe II  Duke of Orléans   and Madame Roland  and others such as pioneering chemist Antoine Lavoisier  lost their lives under its blade  During 1794  revolutionary France was beset with conspiracies by internal and foreign enemies  Within France  the revolution was opposed by the French nobility  which had lost its inherited privileges  The Roman Catholic Church opposed the revolution  which had turned the clergy into employees of the state and required they take an oath of loyalty to the nation  through the Civil Constitution of the Clergy   In addition  the First French Republic was engaged in a series of wars with neighboring powers intent on crushing the revolution to prevent its spread   The extension of civil war and the advance of foreign armies on national territory produced a political crisis and increased the already present rivalry between the Girondins and the more radical Jacobins  The latter were eventually grouped in the parliamentary faction called the Mountain  and they had the support of the Parisian population  The French government established the Committee of Public Safety  which took its final form on 6 September 1793  in order to suppress internal counter revolutionary activities and raise additional French military forces   Through the Revolutionary Tribunal  the Terror s leaders exercised broad powers and used them to eliminate the internal and external enemies of the republic  The repression accelerated in June and July 1794  a period called la Grande Terreur  the Great Terror   and ended in the coup of 9 Thermidor Year II  27 July 1794   leading to the Thermidorian Reaction  in which several instigators of the Reign of Terror were executed  including Saint Just and Robespierre   1  Origins and causes  After the resolution of the foreign wars during 1791–93  the violence associated with the Reign of Terror increased significantly  only roughly of executions had occurred before November 1793  Brumaire  Year I   thus signalling to many that the Reign of Terror might have had additional causes  These could have included inherent issues with revolutionary ideology  and or the need of a weapon for political repression in a time of significant foreign and civil upheaval  leading to many different interpretations by historians   Many historians have debated the reasons the French Revolution took such a radical turn during the Reign of Terror of 1793–94  The public was frustrated that the social equality and anti poverty measures that the revolution originally promised were not materializing  Jacques Roux s Manifesto of the Enraged in 25 June 1793  describes the extent to which  four years into the revolution  these goals were largely unattained by the common people  The foundation of the Terror is centered on the April 1793 creation of the Committee of Public Safety and its militant Jacobin delegates  The National Convention believed that the committee needed to rule with  near dictatorial power  and the committee was delegated new and expansive political powers to quickly respond to popular demands   Those in power believed the Committee of Public Safety was an unfortunate  but necessary and temporary reaction to the pressures of foreign and civil war  Historian Albert Mathiez argues that the authority of the Committee of Public Safety was based on the necessities of war  as those in power realized that deviating from the will of the people was a temporary emergency response measure in order to secure the ideals of the republic  According to Mathiez  they  touched only with trepidation and reluctance the regime established by the Constituent Assembly  so as not to interfere with the early accomplishments of the revolution   Similar to Mathiez  Richard Cobb introduced competing circumstances of revolt and re education within France as an explanation for the Terror  Counter revolutionary rebellions taking place in Lyon  Brittany  Vendée  Nantes  and Marseille were threatening the revolution with royalist ideas  Cobb writes   the revolutionaries themselves  living as if in combat… were easily persuaded that only terror and repressive force saved them from the blows of their enemies    Terror was used in these rebellions both to execute inciters and to provide a very visible example to those who might be considering rebellion  Cobb agrees with Mathiez that the Terror was simply a response to circumstances  a necessary evil and natural defence  rather than a manifestation of violent temperaments or excessive fervour  At the same time  Cobb rejects Mathiez s Marxist interpretation that elites controlled the Reign of Terror to the significant benefit to the bourgeoisie  Instead  Cobb argues that social struggles between the classes were seldom the reason for revolutionary actions and sentiments   Francois Furet  however  argues that circumstances could not have been the sole cause of the Reign of Terror because  the risks for the revolution were greatest  in the middle of 1793 but at that time  the activity of the Revolutionary Tribunal was relatively minimal   Widespread terror and a consequent rise in executions came after external and internal threats were vastly reduced  Therefore Furet suggests that ideology played the crucial role in the rise of the Reign of Terror because  man s regeneration  became a central theme for the Committee of Public Safety as they were trying to instill ideals of free will and enlightened government in the public  As this ideology became more and more pervasive  violence became a significant method for dealing with counter revolutionaries and the opposition because  for fear of being labelled a counter revolutionary themselves   the moderate men would have to accept  endorse and even glorify the acts of the more violent    2  The Terror  On 2 June 1793  Paris sections – encouraged by the enragés Jacques Roux and Jacques Hébert – took over the convention  calling for administrative and political purges  a low fixed price for bread  and a limitation of the electoral franchise to sans culottes alone  With the backing of the national guard  they persuaded the convention to arrest 29 Girondist leaders  including Jacques Pierre Brissot  On 13 July the assassination of Jean Paul Marat – a Jacobin leader and journalist known for his violent rhetoric – by Charlotte Corday resulted in a further increase in Jacobin political influence   Georges Danton  the leader of the August 1792 uprising against the king  was removed from the committee  On 27 July Maximilien Robespierre  known in Republican circles as  the Incorruptible  for his ascetic dedication to his ideals  made his entrance  quickly becoming the most influential member of the committee as it moved to take radical measures against the revolution s domestic and foreign enemies   Meanwhile  on 24 June  the convention adopted the first republican constitution of France  the French Constitution of 1793  It was ratified by public referendum  but never put into force  like other laws  it was indefinitely suspended by the decree of October that the government of France would be  revolutionary until the peace    On 25 December 1793  Robespierre stated   The goal of the constitutional government is to conserve the republic  the aim of the revolutionary government is to found it    The revolutionary government owes to the good citizen all the protection of the nation  it owes nothing to the enemies of the people but death    These notions would be enough to explain the origin and the nature of laws that we call revolutionary     If the revolutionary government must be more active in its march and more free in his movements than an ordinary government  is it for that less fair and legitimate  No  it is supported by the most holy of all laws  the salvation of the people  On 5 February 1794  Robespierre stated  more succinctly  that   Terror is nothing else than justice  prompt  severe  inflexible    The result of this was policy through which the state used violent repression to crush resistance to the government  Under control of the effectively dictatorial committee  the convention quickly enacted more legislation  On 9 September  the convention established sans culottes paramilitary forces  the  revolutionary armies   to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government  On 17 September  the Law of Suspects was passed  which authorized the charging of counter revolutionaries with vaguely defined  crimes against liberty   On 29 September  the convention extended price fixing from grain and bread to other essential goods  and also fixed wages  The guillotine became the symbol of a string of executions  Louis XVI had already been guillotined before the start of the terror  Marie Antoinette  the Girondists  Philippe Égalité  Madame Roland and many others lost their lives under its blade   The Revolutionary Tribunal summarily condemned thousands of people to death by the guillotine  while mobs beat other victims to death  Sometimes people died for their political opinions or actions  but many for little reason beyond mere suspicion  or because some others had a stake in getting rid of them   Among people who were condemned by the revolutionary tribunals  about 8 percent were aristocrats  6 percent clergy  14 percent middle class  and 72 percent were workers or peasants accused of hoarding  evading the draft  desertion  or rebellion  Maximilien Robespierre   frustrated with the progress of the revolution   saw politics through a populist lens because  any institution which does not suppose the people good  and the magistrate corruptible  is evil    Another anti clerical uprising was also made possible by the enactment of the Revolutionary Calendar on the 24th of October  Hébert s and Chaumette s atheist movement initiated an anti religious campaign in order to dechristianise society  The program of dechristianisation waged against Catholicism  and also eventually against all forms of Christianity  included the deportation or execution of clergymen and women  the closing of churches  the rise of cults and the institution of a civic religion  the large scale destruction of religious monuments  the outlawing of public and private worship and religious education  the forced abjuration of priests of their vows and forced marriages of the clergy  the word  saint  being removed from street names  and the War in the Vendée   The enactment of a law on 21 October 1793 made all suspected priests and all persons who harbored them liable to summary execution  The climax was reached with the celebration of the goddess Reason in Notre Dame Cathedral on 10 November  Because dissent was now regarded as counter revolutionary  extremist enragés such as Hébert and moderate Montagnard indulgents such as Danton were guillotined in the spring of 1794  On 7 June  Robespierre  who favored deism over Hébert s atheism  and had previously condemned the Cult of Reason  recommended that the convention acknowledge the existence of his god  On the next day  the worship of the deistic Supreme Being was inaugurated as an official aspect of the revolution  Compared with Hébert s somewhat popular festivals  this austere new religion of Virtue was received with signs of hostility by the Parisian public   3  Fall of Robespierre  The repression brought thousands of suspects before the Paris Revolutionary Tribunal  whose work was expedited by the Law of 22 Prairial  10 June 1794   As a result of Robespierre s insistence on associating Terror with Virtue  his efforts to make the republic a morally united patriotic community became equated with the endless bloodshed  Finally  after 26 June s decisive military victory over Austria at the Battle of Fleurus  Robespierre was overthrown on 9 Thermidor  27 July    One of the last groups to be executed during the terror was the Carmelite Nuns of Compiègne  The nuns were sentenced to death for refusing to give up their monastic vows  They were sent to the guillotine on 17 July 1794  The manner in which they approached their death  going freely up to the scaffold while singing the hymn Veni Creator Spiritus  had a great impact on the public mood in Paris and helped to turn it against the terror   The fall of Robespierre was brought about by a combination of those who wanted more power for the Committee of Public Safety  and a more radical policy than he was willing to allow  with the moderates who opposed the revolutionary government altogether  They had  between them  made the Law of 22 Prairial one of the charges against him  and after his fall  advocating terror would mean adopting the policy of a convicted enemy of the republic  endangering the advocate s own head  Robespierre tried to commit suicide before his execution by shooting himself  although the bullet only shattered his jaw  He was guillotined the next day   The reign of the standing Committee of Public Safety was ended  New members were appointed the day after Robespierre s execution  and term limits were imposed  a quarter of the committee retired every three months   its powers were reduced piece by piece   This was not an entirely or immediately conservative period  no government of the Republic envisaged a Restoration  and Marat was reburied in the Pantheon in September   4  Gallery  File Fusillades de Nantes jpg Mass shootings at Nantes
