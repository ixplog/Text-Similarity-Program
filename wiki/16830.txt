Computer keyboards can be classified by the switch technology that they use  Computer alphanumeric keyboards typically have 80–110 durable switches  one for each key  The choice of switch technology affects key response  the positive feedback that a key has been pressed  and travel  the distance needed to push the key to enter a character reliably   Newer keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve greater cost savings   1  Types  1 1  Membrane keyboard  There are two types of membrane based keyboards  flat panel membrane keyboards and full travel membrane keyboards   Flat panel membrane keyboards are most often found on appliances like microwave ovens or photocopiers  A common design consists of three layers  The top layer  and the one the user touches  has the labels printed on its front and conductive stripes printed on the back  Under this it has a spacer layer  which holds the front and back layer apart so that they do not normally make electrical contact  The back layer has conductive stripes printed perpendicularly to those of the front layer  When placed together  the stripes form a grid  When the user pushes down at a particular position  their finger pushes the front layer down through the spacer layer to close a circuit at one of the intersections of the grid  This indicates to the computer or keyboard control processor that a particular button has been pressed   Generally  flat panel membrane keyboards do not produce a noticeable  physical feedback   Therefore  devices using theses issue a beep or flash a light when the key is pressed  They are often used in harsh environments where water  or leak proofing is desirable  Although used in the early days of the personal computer  on the Sinclair ZX80  ZX81 and Atari 400   they have been supplanted by the more tactile dome and mechanical switch keyboards   Full travel membrane based keyboards are the most common computer keyboards today  They have one piece plastic keytop switch plungers which press down on a membrane to actuate a contact in an electrical switch matrix   1 2  Dome switch keyboard  Dome switch keyboards are a hybrid of flat panel membrane and mechanical switch keyboards  They bring two circuit board traces together under a rubber or silicone keypad using either metal  dome  switches or polyurethane formed domes  The metal dome switches are formed pieces of stainless steel that  when compressed  give the user a crisp  positive tactile feedback  These metal types of dome switches are very common  are usually reliable to over 5 million cycles  and can be plated in either nickel  silver or gold  The rubber dome switches  most commonly referred to as polydomes  are formed polyurethane domes where the inside bubble is coated in graphite  While polydomes are typically cheaper than metal domes  they lack the crisp snap of the metal domes  and usually have a lower life specification  Polydomes are considered very quiet  but purists tend to find them  mushy  because the collapsing dome does not provide as much positive response as metal domes  For either metal or polydomes  when a key is pressed  it collapses the dome  which connects the two circuit traces and completes the connection to enter the character  The pattern on the PC board is often gold plated   Both are common switch technologies used in mass market keyboards today  This type of switch technology happens to be most commonly used in handheld controllers  mobile phones  automotive  consumer electronics and medical devices  Dome switch keyboards are also called direct switch keyboards   See also  Chiclet keyboard  1 3  Scissor switch keyboard  A special case of the computer keyboard dome switch is the scissor switch  The keys are attached to the keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in a  scissor  like fashion  and snap to the keyboard and the key  It still uses rubber domes  but a special plastic  scissors  mechanism links the keycap to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome with a much shorter travel than the typical rubber dome keyboard  Typically scissor switch keyboards also employ 3 layer membranes as the electrical component of the switch  They also usually have a shorter total key travel distance  2 mm instead of 3 5 – 4 mm for standard dome switch keyswitches   This type of keyswitch is often found on the built in keyboards on laptops and keyboards marketed as  low profile   These keyboards are generally quiet and the keys require little force to press   Scissor switch keyboards are typically slightly more expensive  They are harder to clean  due to the limited movement of the keys and their multiple attachment points  but also less likely to get debris in them as the gaps between the keys are often less  as there is no need for extra room to allow for the  wiggle  in the key as you would find on a membrane keyboard    1 4  Capacitive keyboard  In this type of keyboard  pressing the key changes the capacitance of a pattern of capacitor pads  Unlike  dome switch  keyboards  the pattern consists of two D shaped capacitor pads for each switch  printed on a printed circuit board  PCB  and covered by a thin  insulating film of soldermask which plays the role of a dielectric  The mechanism of capacitive switches is very simple  compared to mechanical ones  Its movable part is ended with a flat foam element  of dimensions near to a tablet of Aspirin  finished with aluminium foil below  The opposite side of the switch is a PCB with the capacitor pads   When a key is pressed  the foil tightly clings to the surface of the PCB  forming a daisy chain of two capacitors between contact pads and itself separated with thin soldermask  and thus  shorting  the contact pads with an easily detectable drop of capacitive reactance between them  Usually this permits a pulse or pulse train to be sensed  The keys do not need to be fully pressed to be fired on  which enables some typists to work faster   1 5  Mechanical switch keyboard  Mechanical switch keyboards use separate complete switches underneath every key  Each switch is composed of a base  a spring  and a stem  Depending on the shape of the stem  such keyboards have varying actuation and travel distance  Depending on the resistance of the spring  the key requires different amounts of pressure to actuate  Mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps   The major mechanical switch producers are Cherry and Alps Electric  Companies such as Cooler Master  Corsair  Razer  Thermaltake  Logitech and SteelSeries offer a variety of mechanical model keyboards targeted towards gamers   1 6  Buckling spring keyboard  Many typists prefer buckling spring keyboards  The buckling spring mechanism  expired   atop the switch is responsible for the tactile and aural response of the keyboard  This mechanism controls a small hammer that strikes a capacitive or membrane switch   In 1993  two years after spawning Lexmark  IBM transferred its keyboard operations to the daughter company  New Model M keyboards continued to be manufactured for IBM by Lexmark until 1996  when Unicomp purchased the keyboard technology   Today  new buckling spring keyboards are manufactured by Unicomp  Unicomp also repairs old IBM and Lexmark keyboards   1 7  Hall effect keyboard  Hall effect keyboards use magnets and Hall effect sensors instead of an actual switch  When a key is depressed  it moves a magnet  which is detected by the solid state sensor  These keyboards are extremely reliable  and are able to accept millions of keystrokes before failing  They are used for ultra high reliability applications  in locations like nuclear powerplants or aircraft cockpits  They are also sometimes used in industrial environments  These keyboards can be easily made totally waterproof  They also resist large amounts of dust and contaminants  Because a magnet and sensor are required for each key  as well as custom control electronics  they are very expensive   1 8  Laser keyboard  A laser projection device approximately the size of a computer mouse projects the outline of keyboard keys onto a flat surface  such as a table or desk  This type of keyboard is portable enough to be easily used with PDAs and cellphones  and many models have retractable cords and wireless capabilities  However  sudden or accidental disruption of the laser will register unwanted keystrokes  Also  if the laser malfunctions  the whole unit becomes useless  unlike conventional keyboards which can be used even if a variety of parts  such as the keycaps  are removed  This type of keyboard can be frustrating to use since it is susceptible to errors  even in the course of normal typing  and its complete lack of tactile feedback makes it even less user friendly than the lowest quality membrane keyboards   1 9  Roll up keyboard  Keyboards made of flexible silicone or polyurethane materials can roll up in a moderately tight bundle  Tightly folding the keyboard may damage the internal membrane circuits  When they are completely sealed in rubber they are water resistant  Like membrane keyboards  they are reported to be very hard to get used to  as there is little tactile feedback  and silicone will tend to attract dirt  dust  and hair   See Roll away computer   1 10  Optical keyboard technology  Also known as photo optical keyboard  light responsive keyboard  photo electric keyboard  and optical key actuation detection technology   Optical keyboard technology was introduced in 1962 by Harley E  Kelchner for use in a typewriter machine with the purpose of reducing the noise generating by actuating the typewriter keys   An optical keyboard technology utilizes light emitting devices and photo sensors to optically detect actuated keys  Most commonly the emitters and sensors are located at the perimeter  mounted on a small PCB  The light is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior  and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys  Most optical keyboards require at least 2 beams  most commonly a vertical beam and a horizontal beam  to determine the actuated key  Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern  allowing only one beam per row of keys  most commonly a horizontal beam    The mechanism of the optical keyboard is very simple – a light beam is sent from the emitter to the receiving sensor  and the actuated key blocks  reflects  refracts or otherwise interacts with the beam  resulting in an identified key   Some earlier optical keyboards were limited in their structure and required special casing to block external light  no multi key functionality was supported and the design was very limited to a thick rectangular case   The advantages of optical keyboard technology are that it offers a real waterproof keyboard  resilient to dust and liquids  and it uses about 20% PCB volume  compared with membrane or dome switch keyboards  significantly reducing electronic waste  Additional advantages of optical keyboard technology over other keyboard technologies such as Hall effect  laser  roll up  and transparent keyboards lie in cost  Hall effect keyboard  and feel – optical keyboard technology does not require different key mechanisms  and the tactile feel of typing has remained the same for over 60 years   The specialist Datahand keyboard uses optical technology to sense keypresses with a single light beam and sensor per key  The keys are held in their rest position by magnets  when the magnetic force is overcome to press a key  the optical path is unblocked and the keypress is registered   2  Debouncing  When striking a keyboard key  the key oscillates  or bounces  against its contacts several times before settling  When released  it oscillates again until it reverts to its rest state  Although it happens on such a small scale as to be invisible to the naked eye  it s sufficient for the computer to register multiple key strokes inadvertently   To resolve this problem  the processor in a keyboard  debounces  the keystrokes  by aggregating them across time to produce one  confirmed  keystroke that  usually  corresponds to what is typically a solid contact  Early membrane keyboards had limited typing speed because they had to do significant debouncing  This was a noticeable problem on the ZX81   3  Keytops  Keytops are used on full travel keyboards  While modern keycaps are typically surface printed  they can also be 2 shot molded  laser printed  sublimation printed  engraved  or they can be made of transparent material with printed paper inserts   There are also Keycaps  which are thin shells that are placed over keytop bases  These were used on IBM PC keyboards   4  Other parts of the PC keyboard  The modern PC keyboard also includes a control processor and indicator lights to provide feedback to the user about what state the keyboard is in  Depending on the sophistication of the controller s programming  the keyboard may also offer other special features  The processor is usually a single chip 8048 microcontroller variant  The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs and it processes the incoming keystrokes and sends the results down a serial cable  the keyboard cord  to a receiver in the main computer box  It also controls the illumination of the  caps lock    num lock  and  scroll lock  lights   A common test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the  caps lock  key  The keyboard sends the key code to the keyboard driver running in the main computer  if the main computer is operating  it commands the light to turn on  All the other indicator lights work in a similar way  The keyboard driver also tracks the shift  alt and control state of the keyboard   5  Keyboard switch matrix  The keyboard switch matrix is often drawn with horizontal wires and vertical wires in a grid which is called a matrix circuit  It has a switch at some or all intersections  much like a multiplexed display  Almost all keyboards have only the switch at each intersection  which causes  ghost keys  and  key jamming  when multiple keys are pressed  rollover   Certain  often more expensive  keyboards have a diode between each intersection  allowing the keyboard microcontroller to accurately sense any number of simultaneous keys being pressed  without generating erroneous ghost keys   6  References  7  External links
