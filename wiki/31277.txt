The Bell Curve  Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life is a 1994 book by American psychologist Richard J  Herrnstein  who died before the book was released  and American political scientist Charles Murray  Herrnstein and Murray s central argument is that human intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and is a better predictor of many personal dynamics  including financial income  job performance  birth out of wedlock  and involvement in crime than are an individual s parental socioeconomic status  or education level  They also argue that those with high intelligence  the  cognitive elite   are becoming separated from those of average and below average intelligence   The book was controversial  especially where the authors wrote about racial differences in intelligence and discussed the implications of those differences  The authors were reported throughout the popular press as arguing that these IQ differences are genetic  They wrote in chapter 13   It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences   The introduction to the chapter more cautiously states   The debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved    The book s title comes from the bell shaped normal distribution of intelligence quotient  IQ  scores in a population   Shortly after publication  many people rallied both in criticism and defense of the book  A number of critical texts were written in response to the work   1  Content  The Bell Curve  published in 1994  was written by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray to explain the variations in intelligence in American society  warn of some consequences of that variation  and propose social policies for mitigating the worst of the consequences  Many of the arguments put forth by the authors are controversial  ranging from the relationships between low measured intelligence and anti social behavior  to a genetically driven explanation of the low observed test scores for African American  compared to whites and East Asians   The book was heavily publicized as it was released  just after the death of Herrnstein  In the first several months of its release  400 000 copies of the book were sold around the world  Hundreds of reviews and commentaries were written about the book soon after its publication  The Bell Curve argues that   Intelligence exists and is accurately measurable across racial  language  and national boundaries   Intelligence is one of  if not the most  important factors correlated to economic  social  and overall success in the United States  and its importance is increasing   Intelligence is largely  40% to 80%  heritable   No one has so far been able to manipulate IQ to a significant degree through changes in environmental factors—except for child adoption—and in the light of these failures  future successful manipulations are unlikely   The United States has been in denial of these facts  A better public understanding of the nature of intelligence and its social correlates is necessary to guide future policy decisions  The book s argument is based on the authors  analysis of data compiled in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth  NLSY   a study conducted by the United States Department of Labor s Bureau of Labor Statistics tracking thousands of Americans starting in the 1980s  All participants in the NLSY took the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery  ASVAB   a battery of ten tests taken by all who apply for entry into the armed services   Some had taken an IQ test in high school  and the median correlation of the Armed Forces Qualification Test  AFQT  scores and those IQ test scores was  81   Participants were later evaluated for social and economic outcomes  In general  IQ AFQT scores were a better predictor of life outcomes than social class background  Similarly  after statistically controlling for differences in IQ  many outcome differences between racial ethnic groups disappeared   1 1  Policy recommendations  The book argued the average genetic IQ of the United States is declining due to the tendency of the more intelligent to have fewer children than the less intelligent  the generation length to be shorter for the less intelligent  and the large scale immigration to the United States of those with low intelligence  Discussing a possible future political outcome of an intellectually stratified society  the authors stated that they  fear that a new kind of conservatism is becoming the dominant ideology of the affluent – not in the social tradition of an Edmund Burke or in the economic tradition of an Adam Smith but  conservatism  along Latin American lines  where to be conservative has often meant doing whatever is necessary to preserve the mansions on the hills from the menace of the slums below   Moreover  they fear that increasing welfare will create a  custodial state  in  a high tech and more lavish version of the Indian reservation for some substantial minority of the nation s population   They also predict increasing totalitarianism   It is difficult to imagine the United States preserving its heritage of individualism  equal rights before the law  free people running their own lives  once it is accepted that a significant part of the population must be made permanent wards of the states    Herrnstein and Murray recommended the elimination of welfare policies that encourage poor women to have babies   The book also argued for reducing immigration into the U S  which was argued to lower the average national IQ  It also recommended against policies of affirmative action   2  Reception  2 1  Media response  A 1995 article by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting writer Jim Naureckas analyzed the media response  The Bell Curve received a great deal of media attention  He wrote  While many of these discussions included sharp criticisms of the book  media accounts showed a disturbing tendency to accept Murray and Herrnstein s premises and evidence even while debating their conclusions  and  their critics were sometimes identified with censorious political correctness   Naureckas criticized these assumptions  He also argued that the book was part of a campaign to justify racism and against welfare and immigration   2 2  Peer review  An early criticism was that Herrnstein and Murray did not submit their work to peer review before publication  Many scholarly reviews of the book arrived later as discussed below  Richard Lynn  1999  wrote that  The book has been the subject of several hundred critical reviews  a number of which have been collected in edited volumes    2 3   Mainstream Science on Intelligence   Fifty two professors  most of them researchers in intelligence and related fields  signed an opinion statement titled  Mainstream Science on Intelligence  endorsing a number of the views presented in The Bell Curve  The statement was written by psychologist Linda Gottfredson and published in The Wall Street Journal in 1994 and subsequently reprinted in Intelligence  an academic journal  Of the 131 who were invited by mail to sign the document  100 responded  with 52 agreeing to sign and 48 declining  Eleven of the 48 dissenters claimed that the statement or some part thereof did not represent the mainstream view of intelligence   2 4  APA task force report  In response to the growing controversy surrounding The Bell Curve  the American Psychological Association s Board of Scientific Affairs established a special task force to publish an investigative report on the research presented in the book  In their final report  titled Intelligence  Knowns and Unknowns  some of the task force s findings supported or were consistent with statements from The Bell Curve  They agreed that   IQ scores have high predictive validity for individual differences in school achievement   IQ scores have predictive validity for adult occupational status  even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled   There is little evidence to show that childhood diet influences intelligence except in cases of severe malnutrition  Regarding Murray and Herrnstein s claims about racial differences and genetics  the APA task force stated   Regarding statements about other explanations for racial differences  the APA task force stated  emphasis added    The APA journal that published the statement  American Psychologist  subsequently published eleven critical responses in January 1997   2 5  Criticisms  2 5 1  The validity of IQ and general intelligence  g  One part of the criticism of The Bell Curve focused on the validity of IQ and g  William J  Matthews and Stephen Jay Gould  1994  listed four basic assumptions of The Bell Curve  According to Gould  if any of these premises are false  then their entire argument disintegrates  Gould  1994    Intelligence must be reducible to a single number   Intelligence must be capable of rank ordering people in a linear order   Intelligence must be primarily genetically based   Intelligence must be essentially immutable  Similarly  anthropologist C  Loring Brace in a review wrote that The Bell Curve made six basic assumptions at the beginning of the book  He argued that there are faults in every one of these assumptions   Human Cognitive ability is a single general entity  depictable as a single number   Cognitive ability has a heritability of between 40 and 80 percent and is therefore primarily genetically based   IQ is essentially immutable  fixed over the course of a life span   IQ tests measure how  smart  or  intelligent  people are and are capable of rank ordering people in a linear order   IQ tests can measure this accurately   IQ tests are not biased with regard to race  ethnic group or socioeconomic status   2 5 2  Relationship between IQ and outcomes  The Nobel Memorial Prize–winning economist James Heckman writes that two assumptions made in the book are questionable  that g accounts for correlation across test scores and performance in society  and that g cannot be manipulated  Heckman writes that a reanalysis of the evidence used in The Bell Curve contradicts this story  The factors that explain wages receive different weights than the factors that explain test scores  More than g is required to explain either  Other factors besides g contribute to social performance  and they can be manipulated  Murray argued that this was a straw man and that the book does not argue that g or IQ are totally immutable or the only factors affecting outcomes   In a 2005 interview  Heckman praised The Bell Curve for breaking  a taboo by showing that differences in ability existed and predicted a variety of socioeconomic outcomes  and for playing  a very important role in raising the issue of differences in ability and their importance   However  he also maintained that Herrnstein and Murray overestimated the role of heredity in determining intelligence differences  while admitting to being  a bigger fan of  The Bell Curve  than you might think    Michael Hout of the University of California  Berkeley  along with five colleagues  recalculated the effect of socioeconomic status  using the same variables as The Bell Curve  but weighting them differently  They found that if IQ scores are corrected  as Herrnstein and Murray did  to eliminate the effect of education  the ability of IQ to predict poverty can be made to look dramatically overstated  by as much as 61 percent for whites and 74 percent for blacks  In other words  according to Hout et al   Herrnstein and Murray s finding  that IQ predicts poverty much better than socioeconomic status does  is substantially a result of the way they handled the statistics   In August 1995  at the National Bureau of Economic Research economist Sanders Korenman and Harvard University sociologist Christopher Winship found certain errors in Herrnstein s methodology  Korenman and Winship concluded      there is evidence of substantial bias due to measurement error in their estimates of the effects of parents  socioeconomic status  In addition  Herrnstein and Murray s measure of parental socioeconomic status  SES  fails to capture the effects of important elements of family background  such as single parent family structure at age 14   As a result  their analysis gives an exaggerated impression of the importance of IQ relative to parents  SES  and relative to family background more generally  Estimates based on a variety of methods  including analyses of siblings  suggest that parental family background is at least as important  and may be more important than IQ in determining socioeconomic success in adulthood    One early critical book was The Bell Curve Debate   In the book Intelligence  Genes  and Success  Scientists Respond to The Bell Curve  a group of social scientists and statisticians analyzes the genetics intelligence link  the concept of intelligence  the malleability of intelligence and the effects of education  the relationship between cognitive ability  wages and meritocracy  pathways to racial and ethnic inequalities in health  and the question of public policy  This work argues that much of the public response was polemic  and failed to analyze the details of the science and validity of the statistical arguments underlying the book s conclusions   William J  Matthews writes that part of The Bell Curve s analysis is based on the AFQT  which is not an IQ test but designed to predict performance of certain criterion variables   Heckman observed that the AFQT was designed only to predict success in military training schools and that most of these tests appear to be achievement tests rather than ability tests  measuring factual knowledge and not pure ability  He continues   Janet Currie and Duncan Thomas presented evidence suggesting AFQT scores are likely better markers for family background than  intelligence  in a 1999 Study   Charles R  Tittle and Thomas Rotolo found that the more that written  IQ like examinations are used as screening devices for occupational access  the stronger the relationship between IQ and income  Thus  rather than higher IQ leading to status attainment because it indicates skills needed in a modern society  IQ may reflect the same test taking abilities used in artificial screening devices by which status groups protect their domains   Min Hsiung Huang and Robert M  Hauser write that Herrnstein and Murray provide scant evidence of growth in cognitive sorting  Using data from the General Social Survey  they tested each of these hypotheses using a short verbal ability test which was administered to about 12 500 American adults between 1974 and 1994  the results provided no support for any of the trend hypotheses advanced by Herrnstein and Murray  One chart in The Bell Curve purports to show that people with IQs above 120 have become  rapidly more concentrated  in high IQ occupations since 1940  But Robert Hauser and his colleague Min Hsiung Huang retested the data and came up with estimates that fell  well below those of Herrnstein and Murray   They add that the data  properly used   do not tell us anything except that selected  highly educated occupation groups have grown rapidly since 1940    In 1972  Noam Chomsky questioned Herrnstein s idea that society was developing towards a meritocracy  Chomsky criticized the assumptions that people only seek occupations based on material gain  He argued that Herrnstein would not want to become a baker or lumberjack even if he could earn more money that way  He also criticized the assumption that such a society would be fair with pay based on value of contributions  He argued that because there are already unjust great inequalities  people will often be paid  not for valuable contributions to society  but to preserve such inequalities   In 1995  Chomsky directly criticized the book and its assumptions on IQ  He takes issue with the idea that IQ is 60% heritable saying  the  statement is meaningless  since heritability doesn t have to be genetic  He gives the example of women wearing earrings   He goes on to say there is almost no evidence of a genetic link  and greater evidence that environmental issues are what determine IQ differences   2 5 3  Race and intelligence  One part of the controversy concerned the parts of the book which dealt with racial group differences on IQ and the consequences of this  The authors were reported throughout the popular press as arguing that these IQ differences are genetic  and they did indeed write in chapter 13   It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences   The introduction to the chapter more cautiously states   The debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved    Economist Thomas Sowell criticized the book s conclusions about race and the malleability of IQ  writing   Rushton  1997  as well as Cochran et al   2005  have argued that also the early testing does in fact support a high average Jewish IQ   Columnist Bob Herbert  writing for The New York Times  described the book as  a scabrous piece of racial pornography masquerading as serious scholarship    Mr  Murray can protest all he wants   wrote Herbert   his book is just a genteel way of calling somebody a nigger    One prominent critic of The Bell Curve was the late Stephen Jay Gould  who in 1996 released a revised and expanded edition of his 1981 book The Mismeasure of Man intended to more directly refute many of The Bell Curve s claims regarding race and intelligence  Specifically  Gould argued that the then current evidence showing heritability of IQ did not indicate a genetic origin to group differences in intelligence  This book has in turn been criticized   Psychologist David Marks has suggested that the ASVAB test battery used in the analyses of The Bell Curve correlates highly with measures of literacy  and argues that the ASVAB test in fact is not a measure of general intelligence but of literacy   Melvin Konner  professor of anthropology and associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at Emory University  called Bell Curve a  deliberate assault on efforts to improve the school performance of African Americans    In 1995  Noam Chomsky criticized the book s accusations about race  saying that there is little evidence that IQ is genetic but that it is influenced by the environment  He goes on to criticize the notion that Blacks and people with lower IQs having more children is even a problem and criticized solutions the authors propose to stop it   Rutledge M  Dennis suggests that through soundbites of works like Jensen s famous study on the achievement gap  and Herrnstein and Murray s book The Bell Curve  the media  paints a picture of Blacks and other people of color as collective biological illiterates—as not only intellectually unfit but evil and criminal as well   thus providing  he says  the logic and justification for those who would further disenfranchise and exclude racial and ethnic minorities    Critic Charles Lane pointed out that 17 of the researchers whose work is referenced by the book have also contributed to Mankind Quarterly  a journal of anthropology founded in 1960 in Edinburgh  which has been viewed as supporting the theory of the genetic superiority of the whites   In his book The Bell Curve Wars  Race  Intelligence  and the Future of America  Steven Fraser writes that  by scrutinizing the footnotes and bibliography in The Bell Curve  readers can more easily recognize the project for what it is  a chilly synthesis of the work of disreputable race theorists and eccentric eugenicists    Since the book provided statistical data supporting the assertion that blacks were  on average  less intelligent than whites  some people have feared that The Bell Curve could be used by extremists to justify genocide and hate crimes  Much of the work referenced by the Bell Curve was funded by the Pioneer Fund  which aims to advance the scientific study of heredity and human differences  and has been accused of promoting scientific racism   Evolutionary biologist Joseph L  Graves described The Bell Curve as an example of racist science  containing all the types of errors in the application of scientific method that have characterized the history of scientific racism   claims that are not supported by the data given  errors in calculation that invariably support the hypothesis  no mention of data that contradicts the hypothesis  no mention of theories and data that conflict with core assumptions  bold policy recommendations that are consistent with those advocated by racists   2 5 4  Author s follow up  Murray responded to specific criticisms of the analysis of the practical importance of IQ compared to socio economic status  Part II of The Bell Curve  in a 1998 book Income Inequality and IQ  To circumvent criticisms surrounding their use of a statistical control for socioeconomic status  SES   Murray adopted a sibling design  Rather than statistically controlling for parental SES  Murray compared life outcome differences among full sibling pairs who met a number of criteria  in which one member of the pair has an IQ in the  normal  range and the other siblings has an IQ in a higher or lower IQ category  According to Murray  this design controls for all aspects of family background  full siblings share the same family background  growing up together in the same home and the same community    3  The Global Bell Curve  The Global Bell Curve  Race  IQ  and Inequality Worldwide is a book by Professor Richard Lynn  published by Washington Summit Publishers in 2008  As its title implies  it builds upon The Bell Curve   While Lynn and Vanhanen s IQ and Global Inequality  2006  focus on differences in the development and wealth of nations  The Global Bell Curve presents claims of race based social hierarchies in its selected countries and regions   Lynn writes that there are several theories regarding such differences  Structuralism and discrimination theories assert that those with power maintain their dominance by discriminating against subordinate races  However  notes Lynn  Japanese  Chinese and Jewish immigrants all suffered from discrimination  yet rose above the other communities in Brazil  Britain  Canada  the Netherlands and the United States  Cultural value theorists argue for factors such as work ethic   achievement syndrome  and an ability to delay gratification  Human capital theories argue that groups secure dominant positions through investments in education   Lynn argues that racial differences in IQ map directly to all of these worldwide social hierarchies  He also notes that an explanation based on differences in IQ explain why mixed race populations consistently fall between their parent populations  in terms of social problems and achievements   Behavior genetics researcher Wendy Johnson reviewed The Global Bell Curve in the journal Intelligence and concluded the book presents a lot of correct data with very dubious interpretation   4  The Bell Curve Wars  The Bell Curve Wars  Race  Intelligence  and the Future of America is a collection of articles published in reaction to the book  Edited by Steven Fraser  it contains articles by Howard Gardner  Henry Louis Gates  Jr   Nathan Glazer  Stephen Jay Gould  Andrew Hacker  Jacqueline Jones  John Judis  Mickey Kaus  Randall Kennedy  Michael Lind  Richard Nisbett  Orlando Patterson  Hugh Pearson  Martin Peretz  Dante Ramos  Jeffrey Rosen and Charlie Lane  Thomas Sowell  Leon Wieseltier  and Alan Wolfe   As stated in the introduction  the writers of these essays do not have a specific viewpoint concerning the content of The Bell Curve  but express their own critiques of various aspects of the book  including the research methods used  the alleged hidden biases in the research and the policies suggested as a result of the conclusions drawn by the authors   5  Notes  6  References  Claude S
