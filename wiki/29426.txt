The Sino Indian War     also known as the Sino Indian Border Conflict     was a war between China and India that occurred in 1962  A disputed Himalayan border was the main pretext for war  but other issues played a role  There had been a series of violent border incidents after the 1959 Tibetan uprising  when India had granted asylum to the Dalai Lama  India initiated a Forward Policy in which it placed outposts along the border  including several north of the McMahon Line  the eastern portion of a Line of Actual Control proclaimed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1959   Unable to reach political accommodation on disputed territory along the 3 225 kilometre long Himalayan border  the Chinese launched simultaneous offensives in Ladakh and across the McMahon Line on 20 October 1962  Chinese troops advanced over Indian forces in both theatres  capturing Rezang la in Chushul in the western theatre  as well as Tawang in the eastern theatre  The war ended when the Chinese declared a ceasefire on 20 November 1962  and simultaneously announced its withdrawal from the disputed area   The Sino Indian War is notable for the harsh mountain conditions under which much of the fighting took place  entailing large scale combat at altitudes of over 4 000 metres  14 000 feet   The Sino Indian War was also noted for the non deployment of the navy or air force by either the Chinese or Indian side   1  Location  China and India shared a long border  sectioned into three stretches by Nepal  Sikkim  then an Indian protectorate   and Bhutan  which follows the Himalayas between Burma and what was then West Pakistan  A number of disputed regions lie along this border  At its western end is the Aksai Chin region  an area the size of Switzerland  that sits between the Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang and Tibet  which China declared as an autonomous region in 1965   The eastern border  between Burma and Bhutan  comprises the present Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh  formerly the North East Frontier Agency   Both of these regions were overrun by China in the 1962 conflict   Most combat took place at high altitudes  The Aksai Chin region is a desert of salt flats around 5 000 metres above sea level  and Arunachal Pradesh is mountainous with a number of peaks exceeding 7000 metres  The Chinese Army had possession of one of the highest ridges in the regions  The high altitude and freezing conditions also cause logistical and welfare difficulties  in past similar conflicts  such as the Italian Campaign of World War I  more casualties have been caused by the harsh conditions than enemy action  The Sino Indian War was no different  with many troops on both sides dying in the freezing cold   2  Background  The cause of the war was a dispute over the sovereignty of the widely separated Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh border regions  Aksai Chin  claimed by India to belong to Kashmir and by China to be part of Xinjiang  contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang  China s construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict   2 1  Aksai Chin  The western portion of the Sino Indian boundary originated in 1834  with the Sikh Confederacy s conquest of Ladakh  In 1842  the Sikh Confederacy  which at the time ruled over much of Northern India  including the frontier regions of Jammu and Kashmir   signed a treaty which guaranteed the integrity of its existing borders with its neighbours  The British defeat of the Sikhs in 1846 resulted in transfer of sovereignty over Ladakh  part of the Jammu and Kashmir region  to the British  and British commissioners contacted Chinese officials to negotiate the border  The boundaries at its two extremities  Pangong Lake and Karakoram Pass  were well defined  but the Aksai Chin area in between lay undefined   W  H  Johnson  a civil servant with the Survey of India  proposed the  Johnson Line  in 1865  which put Aksai Chin in Kashmir  Johnson presented this line to the Maharaja of Kashmir  who then claimed the 18 000 square kilometres contained within  Johnson s work was severely criticized as inaccurate  His boundary line was described as  patently absurd   and extending further north than the Indian claim  Johnson was reprimanded by the British Government for crossing into Khotan without permission and resigned from the Survey  According to Francis Younghusband  who explored the region in the late 1880s  there was only an abandoned fort and not one inhabited house at Shahidulla when he was there   it was just a convenient staging post for the nomadic Kirghiz  The abandoned fort had apparently been built a few years earlier by the Kashmiris  In 1878 the Chinese had reconquered Xinjiang  and by 1890 they already had Shahidulla before the issue was decided  By 1892  China had erected boundary markers at Karakoram Pass   In 1893  Hung Ta chen  a senior Chinese official at Kashgar  handed a map of the boundary proposed by China to George Macartney  the British consul general at Kashgar  This boundary placed the Lingzi Tang plains  which are south of the Laktsang range  in India  and Aksai Chin proper  which is north of the Laktsang range  in China  Macartney agreed with the proposal and forwarded it to the British Indian government  The British presented this line  known as the Macartney MacDonald line  to the Chinese in 1899 in a note by Sir Claude MacDonald  In 1911 the Xinhai Revolution resulted in power shifts in China  and by the end of World War I  the British officially used the Johnson Line  However they took no steps to establish outposts or assert actual control on the ground  According to Neville Maxwell  the British had used as many as 11 different boundary lines in the region  as their claims shifted with the political situation  From 1917 to 1933  the  Postal Atlas of China   published by the Government of China in Peking had shown the boundary in Aksai Chin as per the Johnson line  which runs along the Kunlun mountains  The  Peking University Atlas   published in 1925  also put the Aksai Chin in India  Upon independence in 1947  the government of India used the Johnson Line as the basis for its official boundary in the west  which included the Aksai Chin  On 1 July 1954  India s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru definitively stated the Indian position  claiming that Aksai Chin had been part of the Indian Ladakh region for centuries  and that the border  as defined by the Johnson Line  was non negotiable  According to George N  Patterson  when the Indian government finally produced a report detailing the alleged proof of India s claims to the disputed area   the quality of the Indian evidence was very poor  including some very dubious sources indeed    In 1956–57  China constructed a road through Aksai Chin  connecting Xinjiang and Tibet  which ran south of the Johnson Line in many places  Aksai Chin was easily accessible to the Chinese  but access from India  which meant negotiating the Karakoram mountains  was much more difficult  The road came on Chinese maps published in 1958   2 2  The McMahon Line  In 1826  British India gained a common border with China after the British wrested control of Manipur and Assam from the Burmese  following the First Anglo Burmese War of 1824–1826  In 1847  Major J  Jenkins  agent for the North East Frontier  reported that the Tawang was part of Tibet  In 1872  four monastic officials from Tibet arrived in Tawang and supervised a boundary settlement with Major R  Graham  NEFA official  which included the Tawang Tract as part of Tibet  Thus  in the last half of the 19th century  it was clear that the British treated the Tawang Tract as part of Tibet  This boundary was confirmed in a 1 June 1912 note from the British General Staff in India  stating that the  present boundary  demarcated  is south of Tawang  running westwards along the foothills from near Ugalguri to the southern Bhutanese border   A 1908 map of The Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam prepared for the Foreign Department of the Government of India  showed the international boundary from Bhutan continuing to the Baroi River  following the Himalayas foothill alignment  In 1913  representatives of Great Britain  China and Tibet attended a conference in Simla regarding the borders between Tibet  China and British India  Whilst all three representatives initialed the agreement  Beijing later objected to the proposed boundary between the regions of Outer Tibet and Inner Tibet  and did not ratify it  The details of the Indo Tibetan boundary was not revealed to China at the time  The foreign secretary of the British Indian government  Henry McMahon  who had drawn up the proposal  decided to bypass the Chinese  although instructed not to by his superiors  and settle the border bilaterally by negotiating directly with Tibet  According to later Indian claims  this border was intended to run through the highest ridges of the Himalayas  as the areas south of the Himalayas were traditionally Indian  However  the McMahon Line lay south of the boundary India claims  India s government held the view that the Himalayas were the ancient boundaries of the Indian subcontinent  and thus should be the modern boundaries of India  while it is the position of the Chinese government that the disputed area in the Himalayas have been geographically and culturally part of Tibet since ancient times   Months after the Simla agreement  China set up boundary markers south of the McMahon Line  T  O Callaghan  an official in the Eastern Sector of the North East Frontier  relocated all these markers to a location slightly south of the McMahon Line  and then visited Rima to confirm with Tibetan officials that there was no Chinese influence in the area  The British run Government of India initially rejected the Simla Agreement as incompatible with the Anglo Russian Convention of 1907  which stipulated that neither party was to negotiate with Tibet  except through the intermediary of the Chinese government   The British and Russians cancelled the 1907 agreement by joint consent in 1921  It was not until the late 1930s that the British started to use the McMahon Line on official maps of the region   China took the position that the Tibetan government should not have been allowed to make a such a treaty  rejecting Tibet s claims of independent rule  For its part  Tibet did not object to any section of the McMahon Line excepting the demarcation of the trading town of Tawang  which the Line placed under British Indian jurisdiction  However  up until World War II  Tibetan officials were allowed to administer Tawang with complete authority  Due to the increased threat of Japanese and Chinese expansion during this period  British Indian troops secured the town as part of the defence of India s eastern border   In the 1950s  India began actively patrolling the region  It found that  at multiple locations  the highest ridges actually fell north of the McMahon Line  Given India s historic position that the original intent of the line was to separate the two nations by the highest mountains in the world  in these locations India extended its forward posts northward to the ridges  regarding this move as compliant with the original border proposal  although the Simla Convention did not explicitly state this intention   3  Events leading up to war  3 1  Tibet and the border dispute  The 1940s saw huge change in South Asia with the Partition of India in 1947  resulting in the establishment of the two new states of India and Pakistan   and the establishment of the People s Republic of China  PRC  in 1949  One of the most basic policies for the new Indian government was that of maintaining cordial relations with China  reviving its ancient friendly ties  India was among the first nations to grant diplomatic recognition to the newly created PRC   At the time  Chinese officials issued no condemnation of Nehru s claims or made any opposition to Nehru s open declarations of control over Aksai Chin  In 1956  Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai stated that he had no claims over Indian controlled territory  He later argued that Aksai Chin was already under Chinese jurisdiction and that the McCartney MacDonald Line was the line China could accept  Zhou later argued that as the boundary was undemarcated and had never been defined by treaty between any Chinese or Indian government  the Indian government could not unilaterally define Aksai Chin s borders   In 1950  the Chinese People s Liberation Army annexed Tibet and later the Chinese extended their influence by building a road in 1956–67 and placing border posts in Aksai Chin  India found out after the road was completed  protested against these moves and decided to look for a diplomatic solution to ensure a stable Sino Indian border  To resolve any doubts about the Indian position  Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru declared in parliament that India regarded the McMahon Line as its official border   The Chinese expressed no concern at this statement  and in 1951 and 1952  the government of China asserted that there were no frontier issues to be taken up with India   In 1954  Prime Minister Nehru wrote a memo calling for India s borders to be clearly defined and demarcated  in line with previous Indian philosophy  Indian maps showed a border that  in some places  lay north of the McMahon Line  Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai  in November 1956  again repeated Chinese assurances that the People s Republic had no claims on Indian territory  although official Chinese maps showed of territory claimed by India as Chinese  CIA documents created at the time revealed that Nehru had ignored Burmese premier Ba Swe when he warned Nehru to be cautious when dealing with Zhou  They also allege that Zhou purposefully told Nehru that there were no border issues with India   In 1954  China and India negotiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence  by which the two nations agreed to abide in settling their disputes  India presented a frontier map which was accepted by China  and the slogan Hindi Chini bhai bhai  Indians and Chinese are brothers  was popular then  However  Nehru in 1958  had privately told G  Parthasarathi  the Indian envoy to China not to trust the Chinese at all and send all communications directly to him  bypassing the Defence Minister VK Krishna Menon since his communist background clouded his thinking about China  According to Georgia Tech political analyst   Nehru s policy on Tibet was to create a strong Sino Indian partnership which would be catalysed through agreement and compromise on Tibet  Garver believes that Nehru s previous actions had given him confidence that China would be ready to form an  Asian Axis  with India   This apparent progress in relations suffered a major setback when  in 1959  Nehru accommodated the Tibetan religious leader at the time  the 14th Dalai Lama  who fled Lhasa after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule  The Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party  Mao Zedong  was enraged and asked the Xinhua News Agency to produce reports on Indian expansionists operating in Tibet   Border incidents continued through this period  In August 1959  the People s Liberation Army took an Indian prisoner at Longju  which had an ambiguous position in the McMahon Line  and two months later in Aksai Chin  a clash led to the death of nine Indian frontier policemen   On 2 October  Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev defended Nehru in a meeting with Mao  This action reinforced China s impression that the Soviet Union  the United States and India all had expansionist designs on China  The People s Liberation Army went so far as to prepare a self defence counterattack plan  Negotiations were restarted between the nations  but no progress was made   As a consequence of their non recognition of the McMahon Line  China s maps showed both the North East Frontier Area  NEFA  and Aksai Chin to be Chinese territory  In 1960  Zhou Enlai unofficially suggested that India drop its claims to Aksai Chin in return for a Chinese withdrawal of claims over NEFA  Adhering to his stated position  Nehru believed that China did not have a legitimate claim over either of these territories  and thus was not ready to concede them  This adamant stance was perceived in China as Indian opposition to Chinese rule in Tibet  Nehru declined to conduct any negotiations on the boundary until Chinese troops withdrew from Aksai Chin  a position supported by the international community  India produced numerous reports on the negotiations  and translated Chinese reports into English to help inform the international debate  China believed that India was simply securing its claim lines in order to continue its  grand plans in Tibet   India s stance that China withdraw from Aksai Chin caused continual deterioration of the diplomatic situation to the point that internal forces were pressuring Nehru to take a military stance against China   3 2  1960 meetings to resolve the boundary question  In 1960  based on an agreement between Nehru and Chou En Lai  officials from India and China held discussions in order to settle the boundary dispute  China and India disagreed on the major watershed that defined the boundary in the western sector  The Chinese statements with respect to their border claims often misrepresented the cited sources   3 3  The Forward Policy  At the beginning of 1961  Nehru appointed General as army Chief of General Staff  but he refused to increase military spending and prepare for a possible war  According to James Barnard Calvin of the U S  Navy  in 1959  India started sending Indian troops and border patrols into disputed areas  This program created both skirmishes and deteriorating relations between India and China  The aim of this policy was to create outposts behind advancing Chinese troops to interdict their supplies  forcing them north of the disputed line  There were eventually 60 such outposts  including 43 north of the McMahon Line  to which India claimed sovereignty  China viewed this as further confirmation of Indian expansionist plans directed towards Tibet  According to the Indian official history  implementation of the Forward Policy was intended to provide evidence of Indian occupation in the previously unoccupied region through which Chinese troops had been advancing  Kaul was confident  through contact with Indian Intelligence and CIA information  that China would not react with force  Indeed  at first the PLA simply withdrew  but eventually Chinese forces began to counter encircle the Indian positions which clearly encroached into the north of McMahon Line  This led to a tit for tat Indian reaction  with each force attempting to outmanoeuver the other  However  despite the escalating nature of the dispute  the two forces withheld from engaging each other directly   Chinese attention was diverted for a time by the military activity of the Nationalists on Taiwan  but on 23 June the U S  assured China that a Nationalist invasion would not be permitted  China s heavy artillery facing Taiwan could then be moved to Tibet  It took China six to eight months to gather the resources needed for the war  according to Anil Athale  author of the official Indian history  The Chinese sent a large quantity of non military supplies to Tibet through the Indian port of Calcutta   3 4  Early incidents  Various border conflicts and  military incidents  between India and China flared up throughout the summer and autumn of 1962  In May  the Indian Air Force was told not to plan for close air support  although it was assessed as being a feasible way to counter the unfavourable ratio of Chinese to Indian troops  In June  a skirmish caused the deaths of dozens of Chinese troops  The Indian Intelligence Bureau received information about a Chinese buildup along the border which could be a precursor to war   During June–July 1962  Indian military planners began advocating  probing actions  against the Chinese  and accordingly  moved mountain troops forward to cut off Chinese supply lines  According to Patterson  the Indian motives were threefold   Test Chinese resolve and intentions regarding India   Test whether India would enjoy Soviet backing in the event of a Sino Indian war   Create sympathy for India within the U S   with whom relations had deteriorated after the Indian annexation of Goa  On 10 July 1962  350 Chinese troops surrounded an Indian occupied post in Chushul  north of the McMahon Line  but withdrew after a heated argument via loudspeaker  On 22 July  the Forward Policy was extended to allow Indian troops to push back Chinese troops already established in disputed territory  Whereas Indian troops were previously ordered to fire only in self defence  all post commanders were now given discretion to open fire upon Chinese forces if threatened  In August  the Chinese military improved its combat readiness along the McMahon Line and began stockpiling ammunition  weapons and gasoline   Given his foreknowledge of the coming Cuban Missile Crisis  Mao Zedong was able to persuade Nikita Khrushchev to reverse the Russian policy of backing India  at least temporarily  In mid October  the Communist organ Pravda encouraged peace between India and China  When the Cuban Missile Crisis ended and Mao s rhetoric changed  however  Russia reversed course   4  Confrontation at Thag La  In June 1962  Indian forces established an outpost at Dhola  on the southern slopes of the Thag La Ridge  Dhola lay north of the McMahon Line but south of the ridges along which India interpreted the McMahon Line to run  In August  China issued diplomatic protests and began occupying positions at the top of Thag La  On 8 September  a 60 strong PLA unit descended to the south side of the ridge and occupied positions that dominated one of the Indian posts at Dhola  Fire was not exchanged  but Nehru said to the media that the Indian Army had instructions to  free our territory  and the troops had been given discretion to use force  On 11 September  it was decided that  all forward posts and patrols were given permission to fire on any armed Chinese who entered Indian territory    However  the operation to occupy Thag La was flawed in that Nehru s directives were unclear and it got underway very slowly because of this  In addition to this  each man had to carry over the long trek and this severely slowed down the reaction  By the time the Indian battalion reached the point of conflict  Chinese units controlled both banks of the Namka Chu River  On 20 September  Chinese troops threw grenades at Indian troops and a firefight developed  triggering a long series of skirmishes for the rest of September   Some Indian troops  including Brigadier Dalvi who commanded the forces at Thag La  were also concerned that the territory they were fighting for was not strictly territory that  we should have been convinced was ours   According to Neville Maxwell  even members of the Indian defence ministry were categorically concerned with the validity of the fighting in Thag La   On 3 October  a week before the start of the war  Zhou Enlai visited Nehru in New Delhi promising there would be no war  On 4 October  Kaul assigned some troops to secure regions south of the Thag La Ridge  Kaul decided to first secure Yumtso La  a strategically important position  before re entering the lost Dhola post  Kaul had then realised that the attack would be desperate and the Indian government tried to stop an escalation into all out war  Indian troops marching to Thag La had suffered in the previously unexperienced conditions  two Gurkha soldiers died of pulmonary edema   On 10 October  an Indian Punjabi patrol of 50 troops to Yumtso La were met by an emplaced Chinese position of some 1 000 soldiers  Indian troops were in no position for battle  as Yumtso La was 16 000 feet  4 900 m  above sea level and Kaul did not plan on having artillery support for the troops  The Chinese troops opened fire on the Indians under their belief that they were north of the McMahon Line  The Indians were surrounded by Chinese positions which used mortar fire  However  they managed to hold off the first Chinese assault  inflicting heavy casualties   At this point  the Indian troops were in a position to push the Chinese back with mortar and machine gun fire  However  Brigadier Dalvi opted not to fire  as it would mean decimating the Rajput who were still in the area of the Chinese regrouping  They helplessly watched the Chinese ready themselves for a second assault  In the second Chinese assault  the Indians began their retreat  realising the situation was hopeless  The Indian patrol suffered 25 casualties  and the Chinese 33  The Chinese troops held their fire as the Indians retreated  and then buried the Indian dead with military honours  as witnessed by the retreating soldiers  This was the first occurrence of heavy fighting in the war   This attack had grave implications for India and Nehru tried to solve the issue  but by 18 October  it was clear that the Chinese were preparing for an attack on India  with massive troop buildups on the border  A long line of mules and porters had also been observed supporting the buildup and reinforcement of positions south of the Thag La Ridge   5  Chinese and Indian preparations  5 1  Motives  Two of the major factors leading up to China s eventual conflicts with Indian troops were India s stance on the disputed borders and perceived Indian subversion in Tibet  There was  a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian efforts to undermine Chinese control of Tibet  Indian efforts which were perceived as having the objective of restoring the pre 1949 status quo ante of Tibet   The other was  a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian aggression against Chinese territory along the border   John W  Garver argues that the first perception was incorrect based on the state of the Indian military and polity in the 1960s  It was  nevertheless a major reason for China s going to war  However  he argues the Chinese perception of Indian aggression to be  substantially accurate    The CIA s recently declassified POLO documents reveal contemporary American analysis of Chinese motives during the war  According to this document   Chinese apparently were motivated to attack by one primary consideration — their determination to retain the ground on which PLA forces stood in 1962 and to punish the Indians for trying to take that ground   In general terms  they tried to show the Indians once and for all that China would not acquiesce in a military  reoccupation  policy  The secondary reasons for the attack  which had made it desirable but not necessary  included a desire    to damage Nehru s prestige by exposing Indian weakness   to expose as traitorous Khrushchev s policy of supporting Nehru against a Communist country  Another factor which might have affected China s decision for war with India was a perceived need to stop a Soviet U S  India encirclement and isolation of China  India s relations with the Soviet Union and United States were both strong at this time  but the Soviets  and Americans  were preoccupied by the Cuban Missile Crisis and would not interfere with the Sino Indian War  P  B  Sinha suggests that China waited until October to attack because the timing of the war was exactly in parallel with American actions so as to avoid any chance of American or Soviet involvement  Although American buildup of forces around Cuba occurred on the same day as the first major clash at Dhola  and China s buildup between 10 and 20 October appeared to coincide exactly with the United States establishment of a blockade against Cuba which began 20 October  the Chinese probably prepared for this before they could anticipate what would happen in Cuba  Another explanation is that the confrontation in the Taiwan Strait had eased by then   Garver argues that the Chinese correctly assessed Indian border policies  particularly the Forward Policy  as attempts for incremental seizure of Chinese controlled territory  On Tibet  Garver argues that one of the major factors leading to China s decision for war with India was a common tendency of humans  to attribute others behavior to interior motivations  while attributing their own behavior to situational factors   Studies from China published in the 1990s confirmed that the root cause for China going to war with India was the perceived Indian aggression in Tibet  with the forward policy simply catalysing the Chinese reaction   Neville Maxwell and Allen Whiting argue that the Chinese leadership believed they were defending territory that was legitimately Chinese  and which was already under de facto Chinese occupation prior to Indian advances  and regarded the Forward Policy as an Indian attempt at creeping annexation  Mao Zedong himself compared the Forward Policy to a strategic advance in Chinese chess   India claims that the motive for the Forward Policy was to cut off the supply routes for Chinese troops posted in NEFA and Aksai Chin  According to the official Indian history  the forward policy was continued because of its initial success  as it claimed that Chinese troops withdrew when they encountered areas already occupied by Indian troops  It also claimed that the Forward Policy was having success in cutting out supply lines of Chinese troops who had advanced South of the McMahon Line  though there was no evidence of such advance before the 1962 war  However  the Forward Policy rested on the assumption that Chinese forces  were not likely to use force against any of our posts  even if they were in a position to do so   No serious re appraisal of this policy took place even when Chinese forces ceased withdrawing  Nehru s confidence was probably justified given the difficulty for China to supply the area over the high altitude terrain over 5000 km from the more populated areas of China   The Chinese leadership initially held a sympathetic view towards India as the latter had been ruled by British colonial masters for centuries  However  Nehru s forward policy convinced PRC leadership that the independent Indian leadership was a reincarnation of British imperialism  Mao Zedong stated   Rather than being constantly accused of aggression  it s better to show the world what really happens when China indeed moves its muscles    Chinese policy toward India  therefore  operated on two contradictory assumptions in the first half of 1961  On the one hand  the Chinese leaders continued to entertain a hope  although a shrinking one  that some opening for talks would appear  On  the other hand  they read Indian statements and actions as clear signs that Nehru wanted to talk only about a Chinese withdrawal  Regarding the hope  they were willing to negotiate and tried to prod Nehru into a similar attitude  Regarding Indian intentions  they began to act politically and to build a rationale based on the assumption that Nehru already had become a lackey of imperialism  for this reason he opposed border talks   Krishna Menon is reported to have said that when he arrived in Geneva on 6 June 1961 for an international conference in Laos  Chinese officials in Chen Yi s delegation indicated that Chen might be interested in discussing the border dispute with him  At several private meetings with Menon  Chen avoided any discussion of the dispute and Menon surmised that the Chinese wanted him to broach the matter first  He did not  as he was under instructions from Nehru to avoid taking the initiative  leaving the Chinese with the impression that Nehru was unwilling to show any flexibility   In September  the Chinese took a step toward criticizing Nehru openly in their commentary  After citing Indonesian and Burmese press criticism of Nehru by name  the Chinese critiqued his moderate remarks on colonialism  People s Daily Editorial  9 September    Somebody at the Non Aligned Nations Conference advanced the argument that the era of classical colonialism is gone and dead   contrary to facts   This was a distortion of Nehru s remarks but appeared close enough to be credible  On the same day  Chen Yi referred to Nehru by implication at the Bulgarian embassy reception   Those who attempted to  deny history  ignore reality  and distort the truth and who attempted to divert the Conference from its important object have failed to gain support and were isolated   On 10 September  they dropped all circumlocutions and criticized him by name in a China Youth article and NCNA report—the first time in almost two years that they had commented extensively on the Prime Minister   By early 1962  the Chinese leadership began to believe that India s intentions were to launch a massive attack against Chinese troops  and that the Indian leadership wanted a war  In 1961  the Indian army had been sent into Goa  a small region without any other international borders apart from the Indian one  after Portugal refused to surrender the exclave colony to the Indian Union  Although this action met little to no international protest or opposition  China saw it as an example of India s expansionist nature  especially in light of heated rhetoric from Indian politicians  India s Home Minister declared   If the Chinese will not vacate the areas occupied by it  India will have to repeat what it did in Goa  India will certainly drive out the Chinese forces   while another member of the Indian Congress Party pronounced   India will take steps to end  Chinese  aggression on Indian soil just as it ended Portuguese aggression in Goa   By mid 1962  it was apparent to the Chinese leadership that negotiations had failed to make any progress  and the Forward Policy was increasingly perceived as a grave threat as Delhi increasingly sent probes deeper into border areas and cut off Chinese supply lines  Foreign Minister Marshal Chen Yi commented at one high level meeting   Nehru s forward policy is a knife  He wants to put it in our heart  We cannot close our eyes and await death   The Chinese leadership believed that their restraint on the issue was being perceived by India as weakness  leading to continued provocations  and that a major counterblow was needed to stop perceived Indian aggression   Xu Yan  prominent Chinese military historian and professor at the PLA s National Defense University  gives an account of the Chinese leadership s decision to go to war  By late September 1962  the Chinese leadership had begun to reconsider their policy of  armed coexistence   which had failed to address their concerns with the forward policy and Tibet  and consider a large  decisive strike  On 22 September 1962  the People s Daily published an article which claimed that  the Chinese people were burning with  great indignation  over the Indian actions on the border and that New Delhi could not  now say that warning was not served in advance     5 2  Military planning  The Indian side was confident war would not be triggered and made little preparations  India had only two divisions of troops in the region of the conflict  In August 1962  Brigadier D  K  Palit claimed that a war with China in the near future could be ruled out  Even in September 1962  when Indian troops were ordered to  expel the Chinese  from Thag La  Maj  General J  S  Dhillon expressed the opinion that  experience in Ladakh had shown that a few rounds fired at the Chinese would cause them to run away   Because of this  the Indian army was completely unprepared when the attack at Yumtso La occurred   Recently declassified CIA documents which were compiled at the time reveal that India s estimates of Chinese capabilities made them neglect their military in favour of economic growth  It is claimed that if a more military minded man had been in place instead of Nehru  India would have been more likely to have been ready for the threat of a counter attack from China   On 6 October 1962  the Chinese leadership convened  Lin Biao reported that PLA intelligence units had determined that Indian units might assault Chinese positions at Thag La on 10 October  Operation Leghorn   The Chinese leadership and the Central Military Council decided upon war to launch a large scale attack to punish perceived military aggression from India  In Beijing  a larger meeting of Chinese military was convened in order to plan for the coming conflict   Mao and the Chinese leadership issued a directive laying out the objectives for the war  A main assault would be launched in the eastern sector  which would be coordinated with a smaller assault in the western sector  All Indian troops within China s claimed territories in the eastern sector would be expelled  and the war would be ended with a unilateral Chinese ceasefire and withdrawal to prewar positions  followed by a return to the negotiating table  India led the Non Aligned Movement  Nehru enjoyed international prestige  and China  with a larger military  would be portrayed as an aggressor  However  he said that a well fought war  will guarantee at least thirty years of peace  with India  and determined the benefits to offset the costs   China also reportedly bought significant amount of Indian Rupee currency notes from Hong Kong  supposedly to distribute amongst its soldiers in preparation for the war   On 8 October  additional veteran and elite divisions were ordered to prepare to move into Tibet from the Chengdu and Lanzhou military regions   On 12 October  Nehru declared that he had ordered the Indian army to  clear Indian territory in the NEFA of Chinese invaders  and personally met with Kaul  issuing instructions to him   On 14 October  an editorial on People s Daily issued China s final warning to India   So it seems that Mr  Nehru has made up his mind to attack the Chinese frontier guards on an even bigger scale    It is high time to shout to Mr  Nehru that the heroic Chinese troops  with the glorious tradition of resisting foreign aggression  can never be cleared by anyone from their own territory    If there are still some maniacs who are reckless enough to ignore our well intentioned advice and insist on having another try  well  let them do so  History will pronounce its inexorable verdict    At this critical moment   we still want to appeal once more to Mr  Nehru  better rein in at the edge of the precipice and do not use the lives of Indian troops as stakes in your gamble    Marshal Liu Bocheng headed a group to determine the strategy for the war  He concluded that the opposing Indian troops were among India s best  and to achieve victory would require deploying crack troops and relying on force concentration to achieve decisive victory  On 16 October  this war plan was approved  and on the 18th  the final approval was given by the Politburo for a  self defensive counter attack   scheduled for 20 October   6  Chinese offensive  On 20 October 1962  the Chinese People s Liberation Army launched two attacks  1000 kilometres apart  In the western theatre  the PLA sought to expel Indian forces from the Chip Chap valley in Aksai Chin while in the eastern theatre  the PLA sought to capture both banks of the Namka Chu river  Some skirmishes also took place at the Nathula Pass  which is in the Indian state of Sikkim  an Indian protectorate at that time   Gurkha rifles travelling north were targeted by Chinese artillery fire  After four days of fierce fighting  the three regiments of Chinese troops succeeded in securing a substantial portion of the disputed territory   6 1  Eastern theatre  Chinese troops launched an attack on the southern banks of the Namka Chu River on 20 October  The Indian forces were undermanned  with only an understrength battalion to support them  while the Chinese troops had three regiments positioned on the north side of the river  The Indians expected Chinese forces to cross via one of five bridges over the river and defended those crossings  However  the PLA bypassed the defenders by crossing the shallow October river instead  They formed up into battalions on the Indian held south side of the river under cover of darkness  with each battalion assigned against a separate group of Rajputs   At 5 14 am  Chinese mortar fire began attacking the Indian positions  Simultaneously  the Chinese cut the Indian telephone lines  preventing the defenders from making contact with their headquarters  At about 6 30 am  the Chinese infantry launched a surprise attack from the rear and forced the Indians to leave their trenches   The Chinese troops overwhelmed the Indians in a series of flanking manoeuvres south of the McMahon Line and prompted their withdrawal from Namka Chu  Fearful of continued losses  Indian troops escaped into Bhutan  Chinese forces respected the border and did not pursue  Chinese forces now held all of the territory that was under dispute at the time of the Thag La confrontation  but they continued to advance into the rest of NEFA   On 22 October  at 12 15 am  PLA mortars fired on Walong  on the McMahon line  Flares launched by Indian troops the next day revealed numerous Chinese milling around the valley  The Indians tried to use their mortars against the Chinese but the PLA responded by lighting a bushfire  causing confusion amongst the Indians  Some 400 Chinese troops attacked the Indian position  The initial Chinese assault was halted by accurate Indian mortar fire  The Chinese were then reinforced and launched a second assault  The Indians managed to hold them back for four hours  but the Chinese used sheer weight of numbers to break through  Most Indian forces to withdraw to established positions in Walong  while a company supported by mortars and medium machine guns remained to cover the retreat   On the morning 23 October  the Indians discovered a Chinese force gathered in a cramped pass and opened fire with mortars and machine guns  leading to heavy fighting  About 200 Chinese soldiers were killed and wounded in this action  Nine Indian soldiers were also killed  The fighting continued well into the afternoon  until the company was ordered to withdraw  Meanwhile  the 4th Sikhs made contact with the Chinese and subjected them to withering mortar and machine gun fire as the Chinese set off a brushfire and attempted to sneak forward  Sepoy Piara Singh tried to douse the fire while fighting the enemy  but died after he was wounded and refused to be evacuated   Elsewhere  Chinese troops were launched a three pronged attack on Tawang  which the Indians evacuated without any resistance   Over the following days  there were clashes between Indian and Chinese patrols at Walong as the Chinese rushed in reinforcements  On 25 October  the Chinese made a probe  which was met with resistance from the 4th Sikhs  As some Chinese soldiers began to close in  Sepoy Kewal Singh charged them with his bayonet and killed a few of them in hand to hand combat  but he himself was killed  The following day  a patrol from the 4th Sikhs was encircled  and after being unable to break the encirclement  an Indian unit sneaked in and attacked the Chinese flank  allowing the Sikhs to break free   6 2  Western theatre  On the Aksai Chin front  China already controlled most of the disputed territory  Chinese forces quickly swept the region of any remaining Indian troops  Late on 19 October  Chinese troops launched a number of attacks throughout the western theatre  By 22 October  all posts north of Chushul had been cleared   On 20 October  the Chinese easily took the Chip Chap Valley  Galwan Valley  and Pangong Lake  Many outposts and garrisons along the Western front were unable to defend against the surrounding Chinese troops  Most Indian troops positioned in these posts offered resistance but were either killed or taken prisoner  Indian support for these outposts was not forthcoming  as evidenced by the Galwan post  which had been surrounded by enemy forces in August  but no attempt made to relieve the besieged garrison  Following the 20 October attack  nothing was heard from Galwan   On 24 October  Indian forces fought hard hold the Rezang La Ridge  in order to prevent a nearby airstrip from falling to the Chinese    After realising the magnitude of the attack  the Indian Western Command withdrew many of the isolated outposts to the south east  Daulet Beg Oldi was also evacuated  but it was south of the Chinese claim line and was not approached by Chinese forces  Indian troops were withdrawn in order to consolidate and regroup in the event that China probed south of their claim line   7  Lull in the fighting  By 24 October  the PLA had entered territory previously administered by India to give the PRC a diplomatically strong position over India  The majority of Chinese forces had advanced sixteen kilometres south of the control line prior to the conflict  Four days of fighting were followed by a three week lull  Zhou ordered the troops to stop advancing as he attempted to negotiate with Nehru  The Indian forces had retreated into more heavily fortified positions around Se La and Bombdi La which would be difficult to assault  Zhou sent Nehru a letter  proposing  A negotiated settlement of the boundary  That both sides disengage and withdraw twenty kilometres from present lines of actual control  A Chinese withdrawal north in NEFA  That China and India not cross lines of present control in Aksai Chin  Nehru s 27 October reply expressed interest in the restoration of peace and friendly relations and suggested a return to the  boundary prior to 8 September 1962   He was categorically concerned about a mutual twenty kilometre withdrawal after  40 or 60 kilometres of blatant military aggression   He wanted the creation of a larger immediate buffer zone and thus resist the possibility of a repeat offensive  Zhou s 4 November reply repeated his 1959 offer to return to the McMahon Line in NEFA and the Chinese traditionally claimed MacDonald Line in Aksai Chin  Facing Chinese forces maintaining themselves on Indian soil and trying to avoid political pressure  the Indian parliament announced a national emergency and passed a resolution which stated their intent to  drive out the aggressors from the sacred soil of India   The United States and the United Kingdom supported India s response  However  the Soviet Union was preoccupied with the Cuban Missile Crisis and did not offer the support it had provided in previous years  With the backing of other great powers  a 14 November letter by Nehru to Zhou once again rejected his proposal   Neither side declared war  used their air force  or fully broke off diplomatic relations  however  the conflict is commonly referred to as a war  This war coincided with the Cuban Missile Crisis and was viewed by the western nations at the time as another act of aggression by the Communist bloc  According to Calvin  the Chinese side evidently wanted a diplomatic resolution and discontinuation of the conflict   8  Continuation of war  After Zhou received Nehru s letter  rejecting Zhou s proposal   the fighting resumed on the eastern theatre on 14 November  Nehru s birthday   with an Indian attack on Walong  claimed by China  launched from the defensive position of Se La and inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese  The Chinese resumed military activity on Aksai Chin and NEFA hours after the Walong battle   8 1  Eastern theatre  On the eastern theatre  the PLA attacked Indian forces near Se La and Bomdi La on 17 November  These positions were defended by the Indian 4th Infantry Division  Instead of attacking by road as expected  PLA forces approached via a mountain trail  and their attack cut off a main road and isolated 10 000 Indian troops   Se La occupied high ground  and rather than assault this commanding position  the Chinese captured Thembang  which was a supply route to Se La   8 2  Western theatre  On the western theatre  PLA forces launched a heavy infantry attack on 18 November near Chushul  Their attack started at 4 35 am  despite a mist surrounding most of the areas in the region  At 5 45 the Chinese troops advanced to attack 2 platoons of Indian troops at Gurung Hill   The Indians did not know what was happening  as communications were dead  As a patrol was sent  China attacked with greater numbers  Indian artillery could not hold off against superior Chinese forces  By 9 00 am  Chinese forces attacked Gurung Hill directly and Indian commanders withdrew from the area and also from the connecting Spangur Gap   The Chinese had been simultaneously attacking Rezang La which was held by 123 Indian troops  At 5 05 am  Chinese troops launched their attack audaciously  Chinese medium machine gun fire pierced through the Indian tactical defences   At 6 55 am the sun rose and the Chinese attack on the 8th platoon began in waves  Fighting continued for the next hour  until the Chinese signaled that they had destroyed the 7th platoon  Indians tried to use light machine guns on the medium machine guns from the Chinese but after 10 minutes the battle was over  Logistical inadequacy once again hurt the Indian troops  The Chinese gave the Indian troops a respectful military funeral  The battles also saw the death of Major Shaitan Singh of the Kumaon Regiment  who had been instrumental in the first battle of Rezang La  The Indian troops were forced to withdraw to high mountain positions  Indian sources believed that their troops were just coming to grips with the mountain combat and finally called for more troops  However  the Chinese declared a ceasefire  ending the bloodshed   Indians suffered heavy casualties  with dead Indian troops  bodies being found in the ice  frozen with weapons in hand  Chinese forces also suffered heavy casualties  especially at Rezang La  This signalled the end of the war in Aksai Chin as China had reached their claim line – many Indian troops were ordered to withdraw from the area  China claimed that the Indian troops wanted to fight on until the bitter end  However  the war ended with their withdrawal  so as to limit the amount of casualties   The PLA penetrated close to the outskirts of Tezpur  Assam  a major frontier town nearly fifty kilometres from the Assam North East Frontier Agency border  The local government ordered the evacuation of the civilians in Tezpur to the south of the Brahmaputra River  all prisons were thrown open  and government officials who stayed behind destroyed Tezpur s currency reserves in anticipation of a Chinese advance   9  Ceasefire  China had reached its claim lines so the PLA did not advance farther  and on 19 November  it declared a unilateral cease fire  Zhou Enlai declared a unilateral ceasefire to start on midnight  21 November  Zhou s ceasefire declaration stated   Zhou had first given the ceasefire announcement to Indian chargé d affaires on 19 November  before India s request for United States air support   but New Delhi did not receive it until 24 hours later  The aircraft carrier was ordered back after the ceasefire  and thus  American intervention on India s side in the war was avoided  Retreating Indian troops  who hadn t come into contact with anyone knowing of the ceasefire  and Chinese troops in NEFA and Aksai Chin  were involved in some minor battles  but for the most part  the ceasefire signalled an end to the fighting  The United States Air Force flew in supplies to India in November 1962  but neither side wished to continue hostilities   Toward the end of the war India increased its support for Tibetan refugees and revolutionaries  some of them having settled in India  as they were fighting the same common enemy in the region  The Nehru administration ordered the raising of an elite Indian trained  Tibetan Armed Force  composed of Tibetan refugees  The CIA had already begun operations in bringing about change in Tibet   10  World opinion  The Chinese military action has been viewed by the United States as part of the PRC s policy of making use of aggressive wars to settle its border disputes and to distract from its internal issues  According to James Calvin from the United States Marine Corps  western nations at the time viewed China as an aggressor during the China–India border war  and the war was part of a monolithic communist objective for a world dictatorship of the proletariat  This was further triggered by Mao Zedong s views that   The way to world conquest lies through Havana  Accra  and Calcutta   Calvin believes that Chinese actions show a  pattern of conservative aims and limited objectives  rather than expansionism  and blames this particular conflict on India s provocations towards China  However  Calvin also expresses that China  in the past  has been adamant to gain control over regions to which it has a  traditional claim   which triggered the dispute over NEFA and Aksai Chin and indeed Tibet  Calvin s assumption  based on the history of the Cold War and the Domino Effect  assumed that China might ultimately try to regain control of everything that it considers as  traditionally Chinese  which in its view includes the entirety of South East Asia   The Kennedy administration was disturbed by what they considered  blatant Chinese communist aggression against India   In a May 1963 National Security Council meeting  contingency planning on the part of the United States in the event of another Chinese attack on India was discussed  Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and General Maxwell Taylor advised the president to use nuclear weapons should the Americans intervene in such a situation  McNamara stated  Before any substantial commitment to defend India against China is given  we should recognize that in order to carry out that commitment against any substantial Chinese attack  we would have to use nuclear weapons  Any large Chinese Communist attack on any part of that area would require the use of nuclear weapons by the U S   and this is to be preferred over the introduction of large numbers of U S  soldiers   After hearing this and listening to two other advisers  Kennedy stated  We should defend India  and therefore we will defend India   It remains unclear if his aides were trying to dissuade the President of considering any measure with regard to India by immediately raising the stakes to an unacceptable level  nor is it clear if Kennedy was thinking of conventional or nuclear means when he gave his reply  By 1964 China had developed its own nuclear weapon which would have likely caused any American nuclear policy in defense of India to be reviewed  The Johnson Administration considered and then rejected giving nuclear weapons technology to the Indians  However India developed its own nuclear weapon by 1974  within 10 years of the Chinese   The non aligned nations remained mostly uninvolved  and only the United Arab Republic openly supported India  Of the non aligned nations  six  Egypt  Burma  Cambodia  Sri Lanka  Ghana and Indonesia  met in Colombo on 10 December 1962  The proposals stipulated a Chinese withdrawal of 20 km from the customary lines without any reciprocal withdrawal on India s behalf  The failure of these six nations to unequivocally condemn China deeply disappointed India   In 1972  Chinese Premier Zhou explained the Chinese point of view to President Nixon of the US  As for the causes of the war  Zhou asserted that China did not try to expel Indian troops from south of the McMahon line and that three open warning telegrams were sent to Nehru before the war  However  Indian patrols south of the McMahon line were expelled and suffered casualties in the Chinese attack  Zhou also told Nixon that Chairman Mao ordered the troops to return to show good faith  The Indian government maintains that the Chinese military could not advance further south due to logistical problems and the cut off of resource supplies   While Western nations did not view Chinese actions favourably because of fear of the Chinese and competitiveness  Pakistan  which had had a turbulent relationship with India ever since the Indian partition  improved its relations with China after the war  Prior to the war  Pakistan also shared a disputed boundary with China  and had proposed to India that the two countries adopt a common defence against  northern  enemies  i e  China   which was rejected by India  However  China and Pakistan took steps to peacefully negotiate their shared boundaries  beginning on 13 October 1962  and concluding in December of that year  Pakistan also expressed fear that the huge amounts of western military aid directed to India would allow it to threaten Pakistan s security in future conflicts  Mohammed Ali  External Affairs Minister of Pakistan  declared that massive Western aid to India in the Sino Indian dispute would be considered an unfriendly act towards Pakistan  As a result Pakistan made efforts to improve its relations with China  The following year  China and Pakistan peacefully settled disputes on their shared border  and negotiated the China Pakistan Border Treaty in 1963  as well as trade  commercial  and barter treaties  On 2 March 1963  Pakistan conceded its northern claim line in Pakistani controlled Kashmir to China in favor of a more southerly boundary along the Karakoram Range  The border treaty largely set the border along the MacCartney Macdonald Line  India s military failure against China would embolden Pakistan to initiate the Second Kashmir War with India  However  it effectively ended in a stalemate as Calvin states that the Sino Indian War had caused the previously passive government to take a stand on actively modernising India s military  China offered diplomatic support to Pakistan in this war but did not offer military support  In January 1966  China condemned the Tashkent Agreement between India and Pakistan as a Soviet US plot in the region  In the Indo Pakistani War of 1971  Pakistan expected China to provide military support  but it was left alone as India successfully helped the rebels in East Pakistan to found the new nation state of Bangladesh   11  Involvement of other nations  During the conflict  Nehru wrote two desperate letters to U S  President John F  Kennedy  requesting 12 squadrons of fighter jets and a modern radar system  These jets were seen as necessary to beef up Indian air strength so that air to air combat could be initiated safely from the Indian perspective  bombing troops was seen as unwise for fear of Chinese retaliatory action   Nehru also asked that these aircraft be manned by American pilots until Indian airmen were trained to replace them  These requests were rejected by the Kennedy Administration  which was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis during most of the Sino Indian War   According to former Indian diplomat G Parthasarathy   only after we got nothing from the US did arms supplies from the Soviet Union to India commence   In 1962  President of Pakistan Ayub Khan made clear to India that Indian troops could safely be transferred from the Pakistan frontier to the Himalayas   12  Aftermath  12 1  China  According to the China s official military history  the war achieved China s policy objectives of securing borders in its western sector  as China retained de facto control of the Aksai Chin  After the war  India abandoned the Forward Policy  and the de facto borders stabilised along the Line of Actual Control   According to James Calvin of Marine Corps Command and Staff College  even though China won a military victory it lost in terms of its international image  China s first nuclear weapon test in October 1964 and it support of Pakistan in the 1965 India Pakistan War tended to confirm the American view of communist world objectives  including Chinese influence over Pakistan   Lora Saalman opined in a study of Chinese military publications  that while the war led to much blame  debates and ultimately acted as causation of military modernization of India but the war is now treated as basic reportage of facts with relatively diminished interest by Chinese analysts   12 2  India  The aftermath of the war saw sweeping changes in the Indian military to prepare it for similar conflicts in the future  and placed pressure on Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru  who was seen as responsible for failing to anticipate the Chinese attack on India  Indians reacted with a surge in patriotism and memorials were erected for many of the Indian troops who died in the war  Arguably  the main lesson India learned from the war was the need to strengthen its own defences and a shift from Nehru s foreign policy with China based on his stated concept of  brotherhood   Because of India s inability to anticipate Chinese aggression  Prime Minister Nehru faced harsh criticism from government officials  for having promoted pacifist relations with China  Indian President Radhakrishnan said that Nehru s government was naive and negligent about preparations  and Nehru admitted his failings  According to Inder Malhotra  a former editor of The Times of India and a commentator for The Indian Express  Indian politicians invested more effort in removing Defence Minister Krishna Menon than in actually waging war  Krishna Menon s favoritism weakened the Indian Army  and national morale dimmed  The public saw the war as political and military debacle  Under American advice  by American envoy John Kenneth Galbraith who made and ran American policy on the war as all other top policy makers in USA were absorbed in coincident Cuban Missile Crisis  Indians refrained  not according to the best choices available  from using the Indian air force to beat back the Chinese advances  The CIA later revealed that at that time the Chinese had neither the fuel nor runways long enough for using their air force effectively in Tibet  Indians in general became highly sceptical of China and its military  Many Indians view the war as a betrayal of India s attempts at establishing a long standing peace with China and started to question the once popular  Hindi Chini bhai bhai   meaning  Indians and Chinese are brothers    The war also put an end to Nehru s earlier hopes that India and China would form a strong Asian Axis to counteract the increasing influence of the Cold War bloc superpowers   The unpreparedness of the army was blamed on Defence Minister Menon  who resigned his government post to allow for someone who might modernise India s military further  India s policy of weaponisation via indigenous sources and self sufficiency was thus cemented  Sensing a weakened army  Pakistan  a close ally of China  began a policy of provocation against India by infiltrating Jammu and Kashmir and ultimately triggering the Second Kashmir War with India in 1965 and Indo Pakistani war of 1971  The Attack of 1965 was successfully stopped and ceasefire was negotiated under international pressure  In the Indo Pakistani war of 1971 India won a clear victory  resulting in liberation of Bangladesh  formerly East Pakistan    As a result of the war  the Indian government commissioned an investigation  resulting in the classified Henderson Brooks Bhagat Report on the causes of the war and the reasons for failure  India s performance in high altitude combat in 1962 led to an overhaul of the Indian Army in terms of doctrine  training  organisation and equipment  Neville Maxwell claimed that the Indian role in international affairs after the border war was also greatly reduced after the war and India s standing in the non aligned movement suffered  The Indian government has attempted to keep the Hendersen Brooks Bhagat Report secret for decades  although portions of it have recently been leaked by Neville Maxwell   According to James Calvin  an analyst from the U S  Navy  India gained many benefits from the 1962 conflict  This war united the country as never before  India got 32 000 square miles  8 3 million hectares  83 000 km2  of disputed territory even if it felt that NEFA was hers all along  The new Indian republic had avoided international alignments  by asking for help during the war  India demonstrated its willingness to accept military aid from several sectors  And  finally  India recognised the serious weaknesses in its army  It would more than double its military manpower in the next two years and it would work hard to resolve the military s training and logistic problems to later become the third largest army in the world  India s efforts to improve its military posture significantly enhanced its army s capabilities and preparedness  This played a role in subsequent wars against Pakistan   12 2 1  Internment and deportation of Chinese Indians  Soon after the end of the war  the Indian government passed the Defence of India Act in December 1962  permitting the  apprehension and detention in custody of any person  suspected  of being of hostile origin   The broad language of the act allowed for the arrest of any person simply for having a Chinese surname  Chinese ancestry or a Chinese spouse  The Indian government incarcerated thousands of Chinese Indians in an internment camp in Deoli  Rajasthan  where they were held for years without trial  The last internees were not released until 1967  Thousands more Chinese Indians were forcibly deported or coerced to leave India  Nearly all internees had their properties sold off or looted  Even after their release  the Chinese Indians faced many restrictions in their freedom  They could not travel freely until the mid 1990s   13  Later conflicts  India also reported a series of military conflicts after the 1962 war  One report provided by India shows that in late 1967  there were two incidents in which both countries exchanged fire in Sikkim  The first one was dubbed the  Nathu La incident   and the other being  Chola incident    14  Diplomatic process  In 1993 and 1996  the two sides signed the Sino Indian Bilateral Peace and Tranquility Accords  agreements to maintain peace and tranquility along the Line of Actual Control  LoAC   Ten meetings of a Sino Indian Joint Working Group  SIJWG  and five of an expert group have taken place to determine where the LoAC lies  but little progress has occurred   On 20 November 2006 Indian politicians from Arunachal Pradesh expressed their concern over Chinese military modernization and appealed to parliament to take a harder stance on the PRC following a military buildup on the border similar to that in 1962  Additionally  China s military aid to Pakistan as well is a matter of concern to the Indian public  as the two sides have engaged in various wars   On 6 July 2006  the historic Silk Road passing through this territory via the Nathu La pass was reopened  Both sides have agreed to resolve the issues by peaceful means   In Oct 2011  it was stated that India and China will formulate a border mechanism to handle different perceptions as to the LAC and resume the bilateral army exercises between Indian and Chinese army from early 2012   15  In popular culture  Vidyadhar Shastri wrote a Sanskrit poem Himadri Mahtyam to exhort Indians to defend the Himalaya  Australian author Jon Cleary wrote a novel set at the time of the conflict  The Pulse of Danger  1966    A Hindi movie Haqeeqat  1964  and a Tamil movie Ratha Thilagam  1963  were based on events of the Sino Indian war   On June 27  1963  against the backdrop of the Sino Indian War  Lata Mangeshkar sang the patriotic song Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon  literally   Oh  the People of My Country   in the presence of Jawaharlal Nehru  Prime Minister of India  The song  composed by C  Ramchandra and written by Pradeep  is said to have brought the Prime Minister to tears   16  See also  Sino Indian relations  Trans
