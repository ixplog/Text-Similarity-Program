A pencil is a writing implement or art medium usually constructed of a narrow  solid pigment core inside a protective casing which prevents the core from being broken or leaving marks on the user’s hand during use   Pencils create marks by physical abrasion  leaving behind a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface  They are distinct from pens  which instead disperse a trail of liquid or gel ink that stains the light colour of the paper   Most pencil cores are made of graphite mixed with a clay binder which leaves grey or black marks that can be easily erased  Graphite pencils are used for both writing and drawing and result in durable markings  though writing is easily removable with an eraser  it is otherwise resistant to moisture  most chemicals  ultraviolet radiation  and natural aging  Other types of pencil core are less widely used  such as charcoal pencils  which are mainly used by artists for drawing and sketching  Coloured pencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts  but are typically regarded as art supplies  especially those with waxy core binders that tend to smear on paper instead of erasing  Grease pencils have a softer  crayon like waxy core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain   The most common type of pencil casing is of thin wood  usually hexagonal in section but sometimes cylindrical  permanently bonded to the core  Similar permanent casings may be constructed of other materials such as plastic or paper  To use the pencil  the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point  Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which support mobile pieces of pigment core that can be extended or retracted through the casing tip as needed   1  History  Pencil  from Old French pincel  a small paintbrush  from Latin a  little tail   see penis—pincellus is Latin from the post classical period  is an artist s fine brush of camel hair  also used for writing before modern lead or chalk pencils  the meaning of  graphite writing implement  apparently evolved late in the 16th century  Though the archetypal pencil was an artist s brush  the stylus  a thin metal stick used for scratching in papyrus or wax tablets  was used extensively by the Romans  and for palm leaf manuscripts   1 1  Discovery of graphite deposit  Prior to 1565  some sources say as early as 1500   a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish  Cumbria  England  The locals found that it was very useful for marking sheep  This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid  and it could easily be sawn into sticks  This remains the only large scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form  Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead  Consequently  it was called plumbago  Latin for  lead ore    The black core of pencils is still referred to as lead  even though it never contained the element lead  The words for pencil in German  Bleistift   Irish  Peann Luaidhe   Arabic  قلم رصاص qalam raṣāṣ   and other languages literally mean lead pen   The value of graphite was soon realised to be enormous  mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for cannonballs  and the mines were taken over by the Crown and guarded  When sufficient stores of graphite had been accumulated  the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required  Graphite had to be smuggled out for use in pencils  Because graphite is soft  it requires some form of encasement  Graphite sticks were initially wrapped in string or sheepskin for stability  The news of the usefulness of these early pencils spread far and wide  attracting the attention of artists all over the known world   England continued to enjoy a monopoly on the production of pencils until a method of reconstituting the graphite powder was found  The distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s  The town of Keswick  near the original findings of block graphite  still manufactures pencils  the factory also being the location of the Cumberland pencil museum   The first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in Nuremberg  Germany  in 1662  It used a mixture of graphite  sulphur  and antimony   Residual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous  and graphite is harmless if consumed   1 2  Wood holders added  Around 1560  an Italian couple named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti made what are likely the first blueprints for the modern  wood encased carpentry pencil  Their version was a flat  oval  more compact type of pencil  Their concept involved the hollowing out of a stick of juniper wood  Shortly thereafter  a superior technique was discovered  two wooden halves were carved  a graphite stick inserted  and the halves then glued together—essentially the same method in use to this day   English and German pencils were not available to the French during the Napoleonic Wars  France  under naval blockade imposed by Great Britain  was unable to import the pure graphite sticks from the British Grey Knotts mines – the only known source in the world  France was also unable to import the inferior German graphite pencil substitute  It took the efforts of an officer in Napoleon s army to change this  In 1795  Nicholas Jacques Conté discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a kiln  By varying the ratio of graphite to clay  the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied  This method of manufacture  which had been earlier discovered by the Austrian Joseph Hardtmuth of Koh I Noor in 1790  remains in use   In England  pencils continued to be made from whole sawn graphite  Henry Bessemer s first successful invention  1838  was a method of compressing graphite powder into solid graphite thus allowing the waste from sawing to be reused   American colonists imported pencils from Europe until after the American Revolution  Benjamin Franklin advertised pencils for sale in his Pennsylvania Gazette in 1729  and George Washington used a three inch pencil when he surveyed the Ohio Territory in 1762  It is said that William Munroe  a cabinetmaker in Concord  Massachusetts  made the first American wood pencils in 1812  This was not the only pencil making occurring in Concord  According to Henry Petroski  transcendentalist philosopher Henry David Thoreau discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graphite using clay as the binder  this invention was prompted by his father s pencil factory in Concord  which employed graphite found in New Hampshire in 1821 by Charles Dunbar   Munroe s method of making pencils was painstakingly slow  and in the neighbouring town of Acton  a pencil mill owner named Ebenezer Wood set out to automate the process at his own pencil mill located at Nashoba Brook along the old Davis Road  He used the first circular saw in pencil production  He constructed the first of the hexagon  and octagon shaped wooden casings  Ebenezer did not patent his invention and shared his techniques with anyone  One of those was Eberhard Faber of New York  who became the leader in pencil production   Joseph Dixon  an inventor and entrepreneur involved with the Tantiusques granite mine in Sturbridge  Massachusetts  developed a means to mass produce pencils  By 1870  The Joseph Dixon Crucible Company was the world’s largest dealer and consumer of graphite and later became the contemporary Dixon Ticonderoga pencil and art supplies company   By the end of the 19th century over 240 000 pencils were used each day in the US  The favoured timber for pencils was Red Cedar as it was aromatic and did not splinter when sharpened  In the early 20th century supplies of Red Cedar were dwindling so that pencil manufacturers were forced to recycle the wood from cedar fences and barns to maintain supply   One effect of this was that  during World War II rotary pencil sharpeners were outlawed in Britain because they wasted so much scarce lead and wood  and pencils had to be sharpened in the more conservative manner – with knives    It was soon discovered that Incense cedar  when dyed and perfumed to resemble Red Cedar  was a suitable alternative and most pencils today are made from this timber which is grown in managed forests  Over 14 billion pencils are manufactured worldwide annually  Less popular alternatives to cedar include basswood and alder   In Southeast Asia the wood Jelutong may be used to create pencils  though the use of this rainforest species is controversial   Environmentalists prefer the use of Pulai – another wood native to the region and used in pencil manufacturing   1 3  Eraser attached  On 30 March 1858  Hymen Lipman received the first patent for attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil  In 1862  Lipman sold his patent to Joseph Reckendorfer for $100 000  who went on to sue pencil manufacturer Faber Castell for infringement  In 1875  the Supreme Court of the US ruled against Reckendorfer declaring the patent invalid   1 4  Pencil extenders  Historian Henry Petroski notes that while ever more efficient means of mass production of pencils has driven the replacement cost of a pencil down  before this people would continue to use even the stub of a pencil  For those who  did not feel comfortable using a stub  pencil extenders were sold  These devices function something like a porte crayon   the pencil stub can be inserted into the end of a shaft   Extenders were especially common among engineers and draftsmen  whose favorite pencils were priced dearly  The use of an extender also has the advantage that the pencil does not appreciably change its heft as it wears down   Artists currently use extenders to maximize the use of their colored pencils   1 5  Lead poisoning  Although lead has not been used for writing since antiquity  lead poisoning from pencils was not uncommon  Until the middle of the 20th century the paint used for the outer coating could contain high concentrations of lead  and this could be ingested when the pencil was sucked or chewed   2  Manufacture  Modern pencils do not contain lead as the  lead  of the pencil is actually a mix of finely ground graphite and clay powders  Before the two substances are mixed  they are separately cleaned of foreign matter and dried in a manner that creates large square cakes  Once the cakes have fully dried  the graphite and the clay squares are mixed together using water  The amount of clay content added to the graphite depends on the intended pencil hardness  lower proportions of clay makes the core softer   and the amount of time spent on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead  The mixture is then shaped into long spaghetti like strings  straightened  dried  cut  and then tempered in a kiln  The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax  which seeps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil  A juniper or incense cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a  slat   and the graphite clay strings are inserted into the grooves  Another grooved plank is glued on top  and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencils  which are then varnished or painted  Many pencils feature an eraser on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point  Each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a metal ferrule to be secured onto the wood  A rubber plug is then inserted into the ferrule for a functioning eraser on the end of the pencil   3  Grading and classification  Many pencils across the world  and almost all in Europe  are graded on the European system using a continuum from  H   for hardness  to  B   for blackness   as well as  F   a letter arbitrarily chosen to indicate midway between HB and H   It is a persistent myth that  F  stands for  Fine   grade F pencils are no more fine or easily sharpened than any other grade   The standard writing pencil is graded HB  According to Petroski  this system might have been developed in the early 20th century by Brookman  an English pencil maker  It used  B  for black and  H  for hard  a pencil s grade was described by a sequence or successive Hs or Bs such as BB and BBB for successively softer leads  and HH and HHH for successively harder ones   As of 2009  a set of pencils ranging from a very hard  light marking pencil to a very soft  black marking pencil usually ranges from hardest to softest as follows   Koh i noor offers twenty grades from 10H to 8B for its 1500 series  Mitsubishi Pencil offers twenty two grades from 10H to 10B for its Hi uni range  Derwent produces twenty grades from 9H to 9B for its graphic pencils and Staedtler produces sixteen from 6H to 8B for its Mars Lumograph pencils   The main market for such wide range of grades are artists who are interested in creating a full range of tones from light grey to black  Engineers prefer harder pencils which allow for a greater control in the shape of the lead  This is reflected in the way pencils are packaged and marketed  For example  for its Graphic pencils Derwent offers three packages of 12 pencils each  Technical  with hard grades from 9H to B   Sketching  with soft grades H to 9B   and Designer  with medium grades 4H to 6B    Pencils graded using this system are used to measure the hardness and resistance of varnishes and paints  The resistance of a coating  also known as its pencil hardness  is determined as the grade of the hardest pencil that does not permanently mark the coating when pressed firmly against it at a 45 degree angle   Another method uses numbers to designate the grade of a pencil  It was originally created by Conté and adopted in the US by John Thoreau  father of Henry Thoreau  in the 19th century   Although Conté Thoreau s system is widely accepted  not all manufacturers follow it  for example  Faber Castell uses a different equivalence table in its Grip 2001 pencils  1   2B  2   B  2   HB  3   H  4   2H   The various graphite pencil grades are achieved by altering the proportion of graphite to clay  the more clay the harder the pencil  Two pencils of the same grade but different manufacturers will not necessarily make a mark of identical tone nor have the same hardness   4  External colour and shape of pencils  The majority of pencils made in the US are painted yellow  According to Henry Petroski  this tradition began in 1890 when the L  & C  Hardtmuth Company of Austria Hungary introduced their Koh I Noor brand  named after the famous diamond  It was intended to be the world s best and most expensive pencil  and at a time when most pencils were either painted in dark colours or not at all  the Koh I Noor was yellow  As well as simply being distinctive  the colour may have been inspired by the Austro Hungarian flag  it was also suggestive of the Orient at a time when the best quality graphite came from Siberia  Other companies then copied the yellow colour so that their pencils would be associated with this high quality brand  and chose brand names with explicit Oriental references  such as Mikado  renamed Mirado  and Mongol   Not all countries use yellow pencils  German and Brazilian pencils  for example  are often green  blue or black  based on the trademark colours of Faber Castell  a major German stationery company which has plants in those countries  In southern European countries  pencils tend to be dark red or black with yellow lines  while in Australia  they are red with black bands at one end  In India  the most common pencil colour scheme was dark red with black lines  and pencils with a large number of colour schemes are produced by various companies   Pencils are commonly round  hexagonal  or sometimes triangular in section  Carpenters  pencils  see below  are typically oval or rectangular  so they cannot easily roll away during work   5  Notable pencil users  Thomas Edison had his pencils specially made by Eagle Pencil  Each pencil was three inches long  was thicker than standard pencils and had softer graphite than was normally available   Vladimir Nabokov rewrote everything he had ever published  usually several times  in pencil   John Steinbeck was an obsessive pencil user and is said to have used as many as 60 a day  His novel East of Eden took more than 300 pencils to write   Vincent van Gogh used only Faber pencils as they were  superior to Carpenters pencils  a capital black and most agreeable    Johnny Carson regularly played with pencils at his Tonight Show desk  These pencils were specially made with erasers at both ends to avoid on set accidents   Roald Dahl used only pencils with yellow casing to write his books  He had 6 sharpened pencils ready at the beginning of each day and only when all 6 pencils became unusable did he resharpen them   6  Types  6 1  By marking material   Graphite pencils  These are the most common types of pencil  and are encased in wood  They are made of a mixture of clay and graphite and their darkness varies from light grey to black  Their composition allows for the smoothest strokes   Solid graphite pencils  These are solid sticks of graphite and clay composite  as found in a  graphite pencil    about the diameter of a common pencil  which have no casing other than a wrapper or label  They are often called  woodless  pencils  They are used primarily for art purposes as the lack of casing allows for covering larger spaces more easily  creating different effects  and providing greater economy as the entirety of the pencil is used  They are available in the same darkness range as wood encased graphite pencils   Charcoal pencils  Are made of charcoal and provide fuller blacks than graphite pencils  but tend to smudge easily and are more abrasive than graphite  Sepia toned and white pencils are also available for duotone techniques   Carbon pencils  They generally are made of a mixture of clay and lamp black  but are sometimes blended with charcoal or graphite depending on the darkness and manufacturer  They produce a fuller black than graphite pencils  but are smoother than charcoal   Coloured pencils  or pencil crayons  These have wax like cores with pigment and other fillers  Multiple colours are often blended together   Grease pencils  They write on virtually any surface  including glass  plastic  metal and photographs   The most commonly found grease pencils are encased in paper  Berol and Sanford Peel off   but they can also be encased in wood  Staedtler Omnichrom    Watercolour pencils  These are designed for use with watercolour techniques  The pencils can be used by themselves for sharp  bold lines  Strokes made by the pencil can also be saturated with water and spread with brushes   6 2  By use   Carpenter s pencils  These are pencils that have two main properties  their shape prevents them from rolling  and their graphite is strong  The oldest surviving pencil is a German carpenter s pencil dating from the 17th Century and now in the Faber Castell collection    Copying pencils  or indelible pencils   These are graphite pencils with an added dye that creates an indelible mark  They were invented in the late 19th century for press copying and as a practical substitute for fountain pens  Their markings are often visually indistinguishable from those of standard graphite pencils  but when moistened their markings dissolve into a coloured ink  which is then pressed into another piece of paper  They were widely used until the mid 20th century when ball pens slowly replaced them  In Italy their use is still mandated by law for voting paper ballots in elections and referenda    Erasable colour pencils  Unlike wax based coloured pencils  these can be easily erased  Their main use is in sketching  where the objective is to create an outline using the same colour that other media  such as wax pencils  or watercolour paints  would fill or when the objective is to scan the colour sketch  Some animators prefer erasable colour pencils as opposed to graphite pencils because they don t smudge as easily  and the different colours allow for better separation of objects in the sketch  Copy editors find them useful too  as their markings stand out more than graphite but can be erased    Non reproducing  or non photo blue pencils make marks that are not reproduced by photocopiers  Sanford s Copy not or Staedtler s Mars Non photo  or by whiteprint copiers  Staedtler s Mars Non Print     Stenographer s pencil  Also known as a steno pencil  These pencils are expected to be very reliable  and their lead is break proof  Nevertheless sometimes steno pencils are sharpened at both ends to enhance reliability  They are round to avoid pressure pain during long texts    Golf pencil  Golf pencils are usually short  a common length is 9 cm  and very cheap  They are also known as library pencils  as many libraries offer them as disposable  unspillable writing instruments   6 3  By shape  Triangular  more accurately a Reuleaux triangle   Hexagonal  Round  Bendable  flexible plastic   6 4  By size   Typical  A standard  hexagonal   #2 pencil  is cut to a hexagonal height of   but the outer diameter is slightly larger  about   A standard  #2  hexagonal pencil is 19 cm  7 5 in  long    Biggest  On 3 September 2007  Ashrita Furman unveiled his giant US$20 000 pencil – long   with over for the graphite centre  – after three weeks of creation in August 2007 as a birthday gift for teacher Sri Chinmoy  It is longer than the pencil outside the Malaysia HQ of stationers Faber Castell   6 5  By manufacture   Mechanical pencils  There are also pencils which use mechanical methods to push lead through a hole at the end  These can be divided into two groups  propelling pencils use an internal mechanism to push the lead out from an internal compartment  while clutch pencils merely hold the lead in place  the lead is extended by releasing it and allowing some external force  usually gravity  to pull it out of the body   The erasers  sometimes replaced by a sharpener on pencils with larger lead sizes  are also removable  and thus replaceable   and usually cover a place to store replacement leads  Mechanical pencils are popular for their longevity and the fact that they may never need sharpening  Lead types are based on grade and size  with standard sizes being 2 00 mm  1 40 mm  1 00 mm  0 70 mm  0 50 mm  0 35 mm  0 25 mm  0 18 mm  and 0 13 mm   —the 0 9 mm size is available  but is not considered a standard ISO size    Pop a Point Pencils  Pioneered by Taiwanese stationery manufacturer Bensia Pioneer Industrial Corporation in the early 1970s  the product is also known as Bensia Pencils  stackable pencils or non sharpening pencils  It is a type of pencil where many short pencil tips are housed in a cartridge style plastic holder  A blunt tip is removed by pulling it from the writing end of the body and re inserting it to the top of the body    Plastic pencils  Invented by Harold Grossman for Empire Pencil Company in 1967 and subsequently improved upon by Arthur D  Little for Empire from 1969 through the early 1970s  the plastic pencil was commercialised by Empire as the  EPCON  Pencil  These pencils were co extruded  extruding a plasticised graphite mix within a wood composite core   6 6  Other types  The Quadrachromic Pencil is a slightly enlarged pencil with four colours equally partitioned on the tip  The use of each colour while drawing is accomplished by rotating the pencil between the fingers   Penny pencil  Recycled newspaper pencil  7  See also  Blackwing 602  Pencil
