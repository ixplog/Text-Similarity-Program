In abstract algebra  power associativity is a property of a binary operation which is a weak form of associativity   An algebra  or more generally a magma  is said to be power associative if the subalgebra generated by any element is associative  Concretely  this means that if an element x is multiplied by itself several times  it doesn t matter in which order the multiplications are carried out  so for instance   This is stronger than power alternativity  that is for every x in the algebra  but weaker than alternativity or associativity   Every associative algebra is power associative  but so are all other alternative algebras  like the octonions  which are non associative  and even some non alternative algebras like the sedenions and Okubo algebras  Any algebra whose elements are idempotent is also power associative   Exponentiation to the power of any positive integer can be defined consistently whenever multiplication is power associative  For example  there is no need to distinguish whether x3 should be defined as  xx x or as x xx   since these are equal  Exponentiation to the power of zero can also be defined if the operation has an identity element  so the existence of identity elements useful in power associative contexts   A substitution law holds for real power associative algebras with unit  which basically asserts that multiplication of polynomials works as expected  For f a real polynomial in x  and for any a in such an algebra define f a  to be the element of the algebra resulting from the obvious substitution of a into f  Then for any two such polynomials f and g  we have that    1  References
