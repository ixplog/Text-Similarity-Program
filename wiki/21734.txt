The New International Version  NIV  is an English translation of the Christian Bible  Biblica  formerly the International Bible Society  is the worldwide publisher and copyright holder of the NIV  and licenses commercial rights to Zondervan in the United States and to Hodder & Stoughton in the UK  Originally published in the 1970s  the NIV was updated in 1984 and 2011  and has become one of the most popular modern translations   1  History  The NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the value of producing a  faithful translation of the Scriptures in the common language of the American people   The project was formally started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights  Illinois  of the Christian Reformed Church  National Association of Evangelicals  and a group of international scholars  The initial  Committee on Bible Translation  consisted of E  Leslie Carlson  Edmund Clowney  Ralph Earle  Jr   Burton L  Goddard  R  Laird Harris  Earl S  Kalland  Kenneth Kantzer  Robert H  Mounce  Charles F  Pfeiffer  Charles Caldwell Ryrie  Francis R  Steele  John H  Stek  J  C  Wenger  Stephen W  Paine  and Marten Woudstra  The New York Bible Society  now Biblica  was selected to do the translation  The New Testament was released in 1973 and the full Bible in 1978   In 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish with the title La Santa Biblia  Nueva Versión Internacional  often abbreviated NVI  though at this point this version was based only on the former English translation of the historic manuscripts  The English version underwent a minor revision in 1984  In 1990 the committee on Bible translation headed by Drs  René Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a translation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both testaments  bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI Bible in 1999   A planned 1997 English edition was discontinued over inclusive language  A revised English edition titled Today s New International Version  TNIV  released a New Testament in March 2002  with the complete Bible published February 2005  In 2011  an updated version was released  The update incorporated some of the gender language of the TNIV  along with other changes  Translational issues with Paul s letters were also addressed  Keith Danby  president and chief executive officer of Biblica said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and not updating the NIV was a mistake   2  Features  The manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text  Other ancient texts consulted were the Dead Sea Scrolls  the Samaritan Pentateuch  the Aquila  Symmachus and Theodotion  the Latin Vulgate  the Syriac Peshitta  the Aramaic Targum  and for the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome  The manuscript base for the New Testament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies and of Nestle Aland  The deuterocanonical books are not included in the translation   3  Translation philosophy  The core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars  The translation took ten years and involved a team of up to one hundred scholars from the USA  Canada  the United Kingdom  Australia  New Zealand  and South Africa  The range of those participating included many different denominations such as Anglicans  Assemblies of God  Baptist  Christian Reformed  Lutheran and Presbyterian   The NIV is a balance between word for word and thought for thought or literal and phrase by phrase translations   Recent archaeological and linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have traditionally been difficult to translate  Familiar spellings of traditional translations were generally retained   Its translation principles have been questioned for artificially bending towards a creationist interpretation of Genesis 2 19  attempting to impose coherence with Genesis 1  A translation such as the NRSV uses  formed  in a plain past tense  So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal      But the NIV imposes a questionable pluperfect  Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals     to try to make it appear that the animals had already been created  Theologian John Sailhamer states  Not only is such a translation     hardly possible     but it misses the very point of the narrative  namely  that the animals were created in response to God s declaration that it was not good that the man should be alone    4  Circulation  According to the Christian Business Association  the New International Version has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible  having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide   However  other surveys have shown the King James version to be more widely read    There are numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and background information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible  Among these are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible  Concordia Study Bible  the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible  the Wesleyan revision  Reflecting God Study Bible  as well as the Life Application Study Bible   5  Reception  Biblical scholar Bruce M  Metzger criticized the addition of just into Jeremiah 7 22 so the verse becomes  For when I brought your forefathers out of Egypt and spoke to them  I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices   Metzger also criticized the addition of your into   so it becomes  Though it  the mustard seed  is the smallest of all your seeds   avoiding any impression of Jesus s speaking a botanical untruth  The usage of your in this verse has been removed in the 2011 NIV revision   In 2009 N  T  Wright accused the NIV of obscuring what Paul was saying  making sure that he conformed to the Protestants and Evangelical tradition  Concerning previous revisions  he has written that due to paraphrasing and interpretation in Paul s letters  Protestants and Evangelicals will never understand what Paul was talking about if they rely on the NIV  According to Wright  this happens in several of Paul s letters  Galatians and Romans   5 1  2011 Revision  Professor of New Testament Studies Daniel B  Wallace has praised the 2011 update   it is a well thought out translation  with checks and balances through rigorous testing  overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy   However  the Southern Baptist Convention rejected the 2011 update because of gender related issues  Southern Baptist publisher LifeWay declined the SBC s censor request to remove the NIV from their stores  The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod also cautioned against its use   6  References  7  External links    Barker  Kenneth L   ed    Biblica    Dr  James R  White  Christian Research Institute
