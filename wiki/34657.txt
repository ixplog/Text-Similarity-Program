The 1966 FIFA World Cup Final was the final match in the 1966 FIFA World Cup  the eighth football World Cup and one of the most controversial finals ever  The match was contested by England and West Germany on 30 July 1966 at Wembley Stadium in London  and had an attendance of 96 924   England won 4–2 after extra time to win the Jules Rimet Trophy  The England team became known as the  wingless wonders   on account of their then unconventional narrow attacking formation  described at the time as a 4–3–3  The match is remembered for England s only World Cup trophy  Geoff Hurst s hat trick – the only one ever scored in a World Cup Final – and the controversial third goal awarded to England by referee Gottfried Dienst and linesman Tofiq Bahramov   1  Road to Wembley  Both teams were strong throughout the tournament  Each won all but one of their three matches in the group stages  which they both drew  West Germany tied against Argentina  while England drew against Uruguay  at that time tied for the number of World Cups won with Italy and Brazil  The German team conceded but two goals before the final  and England did not concede at all until their semi final against Portugal   2  Match  2 1  Summary  2 1 1  Normal time  England  managed by Alf Ramsey and captained by Bobby Moore  won the toss and elected to kick off  After 12 minutes  Siegfried Held sent a cross into the English penalty area which Ray Wilson misheaded to Helmut Haller  who got his shot on target  Jackie Charlton and goalkeeper Gordon Banks failed to deal with the shot which went in making it 1–0 to West Germany   In the 19th minute  Wolfgang Overath conceded a free kick  which Moore took immediately  floating a cross into the West German area  where Geoff Hurst rose unchallenged and levelled the scores with a downward glancing header  The teams were level at half time  and after 77 minutes England won a corner  Alan Ball delivered the ball to Geoff Hurst whose deflected shot from the edge of the area found Martin Peters  He produced the final shot  beating the West German keeper from eight yards to make the score 2–1 to England   Germany pressed for an equaliser in the closing moments  and in the 89th minute Jack Charlton conceded a free kick for climbing on Uwe Seeler as they both went up for a header  The kick was taken by Lothar Emmerich  who struck it into George Cohen in the wall  the rebound fell to Held  who shot across the face of goal and into the body of Karl Heinz Schnellinger  The ball deflected across the England six yard box  wrong footing the England defence and allowing Wolfgang Weber to level the score at 2–2 and force the match into extra time  Banks protested that the ball had struck Schnellinger on the arm  and reiterated the claim in his 2002 autobiography  but replays showed that it actually struck Schnellinger on the back   2 1 2  Extra time  England pressed forward and created several chances  In particular  with five minutes gone  Bobby Charlton struck the post and sent another shot just wide  With 11 minutes of extra time gone  Alan Ball put in a cross and Geoff Hurst swivelled and shot from close range  The ball hit the underside of the cross bar  bounced down – on the line – and was cleared  The referee Gottfried Dienst was uncertain if it had been a goal and consulted his linesman  Tofiq Bahramov from the Azerbaijan   who in a moment of drama indicated that it was  After non verbal communication  as they had no common language  the Swiss referee awarded the goal to the home team  The crowd and the audience of 400 million television viewers were left arguing whether the goal should have been given or not   England s third goal has remained controversial ever since the match  According to the Laws of the Game the definition of a goal is when  the whole of the ball passes over the goal line    In England  supporters cite the good position of the linesman and the statement of Roger Hunt  the nearest England player to the ball  who claimed it was a goal and that was why he wheeled away in celebration rather than attempting to tap the rebounding ball in   Modern studies using film analysis and computer simulation have conclusively proved the ball never crossed the line – both Duncan Gillies of the Visual Information Processing Group at Imperial College London and Ian Reid and Andrew Zisserman of the Department of Engineering Science at University of Oxford agree that the ball would have needed to travel a further 2 5–6 0 cm to fully cross the line  and that therefore this was not strictly speaking a goal  Furthermore  there exists colour footage of Hurst s goal  taken from another angle by an amateur cameraman in the stands and having a view almost parallel to the English goal line  This film material claims that the ball did not cross the goal line in full   Some Germans cited possible bias of the Soviet linesman  Bakhramov was from Azerbaijan   especially as the USSR had just been defeated in the semi finals by West Germany  Bakhramov later stated in his memoirs that he believed the ball had bounced back not from the crossbar  but from the net and that he was not able to observe the rest of the scene  so it did not matter where the ball hit the ground anyway   An apocryphal story exists that Bakhramov  when asked why he gave the goal later  simply replied  Stalingrad   There is no evidence that this is genuine   Swiss referee Gottfried Dienst did not see the scene   One minute before the end of play  the West Germans sent their defenders forward in a desperate attempt to score a last minute equaliser  Winning the ball  Bobby Moore picked out the unmarked Geoff Hurst with a long pass  which Hurst carried forward while some spectators began streaming onto the field and Hurst scored moments later  Hurst later admitted that his blistering shot was as much intended to send the ball as far into the Wembley stands as possible should it miss  in order to kill time on the clock   The final goal gave rise to one of the most famous sayings in English football  when the BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme described the situation as follows   The matchball from the final is now on display in the National Football Museum in Manchester   2 2  Details  3  Champions photograph and statue  One of the enduring images of the celebrations in Wembley immediately after the game was the picture of the captain Bobby Moore holding the Jules Rimet Trophy aloft  on the shoulders of Geoff Hurst and Ray Wilson  together with Martin Peters  In recognition of Moore and other West Ham United players  contribution to the win  the club and Newham Borough Council jointly commissioned a statue of this scene  On 28 April 2003 Prince Andrew as president of The Football Association  duly unveiled the World Cup Sculpture  also called The Champions  in a prominent place near West Ham s Boleyn Ground  Upton Park   at the junction of Barking Road and Green Street  The one and a half life size bronze piece was sculpted by Philip Jackson   4  Cultural impact  The final is the most watched event ever on British television  as of September 2009  attracting 32 60 million viewers  In Germany  a goal resulting from a shot bouncing off the crossbar and hitting the line is called a Wembley Tor  Wembley Goal  due to the controversial nature of Hurst s second goal  This goal has been parodied a large number of times  Some of the most notable include   England s third goal was referenced in a 2006 Adidas advertisement  where English midfielder Frank Lampard takes a shot at German keeper Oliver Kahn  and a similar event happens  On 27 June 2010 at that year s World Cup a goal by Lampard was disallowed which would have levelled the second round game against Germany 2–2  Germany won 4–1    Kenneth Wolstenholme s commentary on the third goal that bounced on the line   It s a goal   was used  along with the sound of breaking glass  in the tape looped coda of an early version of The Beatles song  Glass Onion   available on the album Anthology 3   Kit Kat parodied the controversial third goal in an advert for the Kit Kat bar  The goal is scored and the linesman was shown about to eat a Kit Kat bar as opposed to following the game  Upon realising that a possible goal has been scored  he hastily stuffs the bar into his mouth and awards the goal  In August 1966 a special 4d stamp marked ENGLAND WINNERS was issued by the British Post Office to celebrate the victory and which soared in value to up to 15 shillings each on the back of public enthusiasm for the victory before falling back in value when the public realised it was not rare   England s win in the final also helped fans to create the Two World Wars and One World Cup chant   5  2009 receipt of winners medals  The players and staff of England s winning squad who did not get medals in 1966 received them on 10 June 2009 after a ceremony at 10 Downing Street in London  Initially  only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the match received medals  but FIFA later awarded medals to every non playing squad and staff member from every World Cup winning country from 1930 to 1974   6  See also  England–Germany football rivalry  Ghost goal  7  References
