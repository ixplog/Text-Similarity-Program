A machine pistol is typically a handgun style  magazine fed  self loading firearm  capable of fully automatic or burst fire  and chambered for pistol cartridges  The term is a literal translation of Maschinenpistole  the German term for a hand held automatic weapon firing pistol cartridges  While the dividing line between machine pistols and compact submachine guns is hard to draw  the term  submachine gun  usually refers to carbines designed for automatic fire of pistol cartridges  while the term  machine pistol  usually refers to a weapon built up from a semi automatic pistol design  Machine pistols are generally more compact to be concealable and can be operated one handed  while submachine guns are usually designed to be two handed and tend to have longer barrels for better accuracy   As a small  concealable weapon with a high rate of fire  machine pistols have numerous applications  Bodyguards from government or private agencies sometimes carry concealed machine pistols when they are protecting high risk VIPs  Criminal gang members such as narcotics traffickers also use machine pistols  often cheaper guns such as the MAC 10 or the Tec 9 which have been illegally converted to fire in a fully automatic fashion  In a law enforcement context  machine pistols may be used by tactical police units such as SWAT teams or hostage rescue teams which are operating inside buildings and other cramped spaces  although they tend to use submachine guns instead   In a military setting  some countries issue machine pistols as personal defense side arms to infantry  paratroopers  artillery crews  helicopter crews or tank crews  They have also been used in close quarters combat  CQC  settings where a small weapon is needed  e g  by special forces attacking buildings or tunnels   In the 2000s  the machine pistol started to be supplanted by the personal defense weapon  a compact  fully automatic submachine gun like firearm which fires armour piercing rounds instead of pistol ammunition   1  History and variants  1 1  1918 1960s  In World War I  in the last year of the conflict  the Germans developed the Bergmann MP 18  a small  hand held automatic weapon with a  rifle like  form  including a wooden stock   Even though it looked like a small rifle  it used 9mm pistol ammunition  which introduced the idea of an automatic weapon that fired pistol rounds  While heavy machine guns such as the Maxim gun and the Vickers gun were fearsome defensive weapons in a built up emplacement  they were very hard to move to a new position if the army had advanced to a new area  or if it had to fall back  The German Army recognized that to break the stalemate of trench warfare  a light  hand held automatic weapon was needed that would enable individual soldiers to move with the gun to new firing positions   The Germans also did experiments with converting various types of pistols to machine pistols  Reihenfeuerpistolen  literally  row fire pistols    The Luger P08 long barrel pistol was issued in World War I to German artillery crews  It was manufactured with a longer barrel as it was recognized that artillery crew needed a lighter weapon than a rifle but with similar accuracy to defend themselves  It had a newly developed pistol cartridge  the 9mm Parabellum  which was designed for low recoil without sacrificing penetration and stopping power  Although not armour piercing  the bullet more than sufficed for the time   Unlike the Luger  the Mauser C96 pistol was modified to fire in a fully automatic mode  First produced in 1896 as one of the first commercially successful and practical semi automatic pistols  Spanish gunmakers in the late 1920s introduced  select fire  copies of the C96 with detachable magazines  and in the early 1930s Mauser engineers introduced the model 711 and 712 Schnellfeuer variants  which included a fire selector mechanism allowing fully automatic fire at a rate of 1000 rounds minute  Due to the weapon s light barrel  the fully automatic rate of fire could only be used for short bursts   In the Prohibition Era  a San Antonio gunsmith  Hyman S  Lebman converted at least 5 Colt M1911s chambered in  38 super and  45 ACP to fire fully automatic  These were true hand held machine pistols  which were fitted with Thompson submachine gun Model 1921 vertical grips on their dust covers  an extended barrel with muzzle brakes similar to the Thompson s  an extended 20 round magazine  They could only be fired on fully automatic  Lebman then sold these  baby machine guns  to Prohibition Era gangsters  the most notable being John Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson   In World War II  the Polish resistance produced a crude  simply constructed machine pistol called the Bechowiec 1  The weapon was designed in 1943 by engineer Henryk Strąpoć and produced in several underground facilities  the name is a reference to the resistance fighters who used the weapon   The APS Stechkin is a Russian selective fire machine pistol introduced into the Russian army in 1951  Like the other common Russian army pistol of this era  the Makarov  the Stechkin uses a simple unlocked blow back mechanism and the double action trigger  In addition  the Stechkin APS has an automatic fire mode  which is selected using the safety lever  In burst or automatic fire  the pistol should be fitted with the wooden shoulder stock  otherwise  the weapon quickly becomes uncontrollable   The Stechkin was intended as a side arm for artillery soldiers and tank crews  In practice  it earned a strong following in the ranks of political and criminal police  special forces and the like  Many KGB and GRU operatives favored the Stechkin for its power and magazine capacity  Though somewhat heavy and cumbersome  it was the only  high powered  alternative to the modest performing PM  As a pistol  the Stechkin is being slowly replaced by the Yarygin PYa  as a PDW  it was replaced by the AKS 74U compact assault rifle  now widely used in law enforcement   1 2  1970s 1980s  Since it is difficult to control machine pistols when they are fired in full automatic mode  in the 1970s  some manufacturers developed an  intermittent fire  setting that fires a burst of three shots instead of a full automatic stream  In the 1970s  the Italian Beretta company developed the Beretta Model 93R  a selective fire machine pistol meant for police and military use  It offered extra firepower in a small package and is suited for concealed carry purposes such as VIP protection  or for close quarters maneuvers such as room to room searches  A selector switch and the foldable foregrip allows the pistol to fire three round bursts with each pull of the trigger for a cyclic rate of 1100 rounds per minute  The designers limited it to fixed three round bursts to allow it to be more easily controlled   Another machine pistol using the three shot burst system is the Heckler & Koch VP70  It will only fire three round bursts with the stock attached  It is a 9 mm  18 round  double action only  semi automatic three round burst capable polymer frame pistol manufactured by German arms firm Heckler & Koch GmbH  the VP designation stands for Volkspistole   The people s pistol    and the designation 70 was for the year of the first edition  1970  It was the first polymer framed pistol  predating the Glock 17  The stock incorporates a selector switch that allows selective fire  Cyclic rounds per minute for the three round bursts is 2200 rpm  The VP70 uses a spring loaded striker like a Glock  instead of a conventional firing pin  It is double action only  so the trigger pull is relatively heavy  Despite the VP70 s potential  it was never adopted by the Bundeswehr   The MAC 10  also known as the  Ingram Model 10   and MAC 11  also called the  Ingram Model 11   were 1970s blowback designed weapons with the magazine in the pistol grip and a fire selector switch  The  45 ACP MAC 10 had a 1145 round per minute rate of fire  and the 9mm version 1090 rounds per minute  The MAC 11 could fire 1200 rounds per minute with its 9x17mm  380 ACP cartridges  The guns were designed by Gordon Ingram and Military Armament Corporation of Georgia  The weapons used in special ops and clandestine applications in Vietnam and by Brazilian anti terrorist units  It could be fitted with a silencer using its threaded barrel  While some sources call the MAC 10 and MAC 11 machine pistols  the guns are also referred to as compact submachine guns   The Stechkin APS made a comeback in the late 1970s  when Russian Spetsnaz special forces units in Afghanistan used suppressor equipped machine pistols for clandestine missions in enemy territory  such as during the Soviet war in Afghanistan   In the 1980s  some machine pistols  such as the Glock 18 were made with vents or cuts that run across the top of the barrel  These vents act as a compensator  thus counteracting the tendency of machine pistols to rise when fired in automatic mode  The Glock 18 is a selective fire variant of the Glock 17  developed in 1986 at the request of the Austrian counter terrorist unit EKO Cobra  The Glock 18 is not legally available to the civilian market  This machine pistol class firearm has a lever type fire control selector switch  installed on the left side of the slide  in the rear  serrated portion  selector lever in the bottom position for continuous fire  top setting for single fire   The firearm is typically used with an extended 33 round capacity magazine  The pistol s rate of fire in fully automatic mode is approximately 1100–1200 rounds min   The Micro Uzi is a scaled down version of the Uzi  first introduced in 1983  It is 460 mm  18 11 inches  long with the stock extended  and just 250 mm  9 84 inches  long with the stock folded  Its barrel length is 117 mm and its muzzle velocity is 350 m s  After its early 1980s introduction  it was used by the Israeli Isayeret and the US Secret Service  In the 1990s and 2000s  Israeli counter terror units such as the YAMAM used the 33 round Glock 18 magazine with their Para Micro Uzi machine pistols  The UZI submachine gun upon which the Micro Uzi is based was developed in Israel by Uziel Gal in the late 1940s  Micro Uzis are available in open bolt or closed bolt versions  The weapon has an additional tungsten weight on the bolt to slow the rate of fire  which would otherwise make such a lightweight weapon uncontrollable   There is also a rare version of the Česká Zbrojovka CZ75 that is fully automatic with a longer barrel and three vent ports on the elongated part  This machine pistol has a horizontal rail in front of the trigger guard through which a spare magazine can be attached and be used as a foregrip for better control during full automatic firing  This weapon is still produced by CZ but is only available to military and law enforcement personnel   In 1988  an unusually designed US 9mm machine pistol named the Calico M950 was introduced  Unlike most machine pistols  which use magazines in the pistol grip or in a vertical box  the M950 uses a 50 round or 100 round helical magazine which is mounted parallel to the barrel  To get a sense of how the helical magazine appears  and how it is mounted  one can imagine a machine pistol with a bulky optical scope mounted on the picatinny rail on the top of the weapon   The Saturn machine pistol is of Colombian origin  and it is designed for clandestine operations  The weapon is twin barreled and is fed from a dual magazine  The weapon has one bolt with two firing pins  An unusual dual barrel suppressor can be used on this firearm   1 3  1990s 2000s  During the 1990s  the Russian Stechkin APS was once again put into service  as a weapon for VIP bodyguards and for anti terrorist hostage rescue teams that needed the capability for full automatic fire in emergencies  In the 1990s and 2000s the personal defense weapon  a compact submachine gun like firearm which can fire armor piercing  higher powered ammunition began to replace the machine pistol as a self defence side arm for artillery crews  tank crews  and helicopter pilots   2  Comparison with submachine gun  The dividing line between machine pistols and compact submachine guns is difficult to draw  Originally   maschinenpistole  was simply the German word for personal  automatic military weapons  while  submachine gun  was a term coined by John T  Thompson  American inventor of the Thompson submachine gun  While the term submachine gun usually refers to an automatic firearm larger than a pistol  several weapons are classed in both categories  The 1960s CZ Scorpion  a Czechoslovak 7 65 mm weapon  for example  is often labeled a submachine gun  However  with its small magazine  it is small enough to be carried in a pistol holster  which suggests that it could be classified as a machine pistol   In the 1980s  weapons such as the MAC 10 and the compact versions of the Uzi series have been placed in both classes  The popularity of submachine guns in recent years has led many weapons previously described as machine pistols to be advertised to as submachine guns  such as the Brugger & Thomet MP9  developed on the design of the Steyr TMP    The Steyr TMP  Tactical Machine Pistol  is a 9 mm blowback operated  rotating barrel weapon that is 282 mm long and that can fire 800–900 rounds per minute  despite its small size  lack of a stock  and the fact that it is called a  tactical machine pistol   it is often classed as a compact submachine gun  Likewise  the German Heckler & Koch MP5K  a weapon small enough to be concealed on one s person or in a briefcase   is also classed as a compact submachine gun   A machine pistol is typically based on a semi automatic pistol design  While most machine pistols are designed to be fired with one hand  their light weight  small size  and extremely rapid rates of fire make them difficult to control  To improve accuracy  some machine pistols are fitted with a shoulder stock  Some  such as the Heckler & Koch VP70  will only fire single rounds unless the stock is attached  because there is a safety mechanism incorporated into the stock  The Beretta 93R offers an optional forward handgrip  which is another way of increasing weapon controllability in full automatic mode   3  Tactics  There are many tactics where machine pistols come into play  including room clearing  personal defense  close quarter battle and door breaching   3 1  Military  As an offensive weapon  the machine pistol has limited uses  because it fires pistol ammunition and has a short barrel  which means that it is both inaccurate and lacks power in open country fighting at a several hundred meter range  When the machine pistol was first introduced during the last year of World War I  it was used in trench warfare  In World War II  machine pistols were carried by platoon leaders  artillery crews  and tank crews   In the decades after World War II  machine pistols were used in close quarter combat where a rifle would be too unwieldy  such as in urban house to house fighting or in tunnels  In these contexts  machine pistols were viewed as  room brooms   which could sweep a space with automatic fire  While training doctrines for machine pistols vary between armies  in general  soldiers are instructed to use the weapon for short bursts  rather than for an uninterrupted period of automatic fire  because the weapon easily gets out of control in sustained firing  which means that many of the rounds may be off target  As well  given the high rate of fire of machine pistols  sustained firing wastes ammunition and can easily deplete the magazine too quickly   In the 1990s and 2000s  as body armor became increasingly common on battlefields  the machine pistol became less useful in a military setting  because its low powered pistol ammunition is not able to penetrate ceramic plated Kevlar military vests  As a result  armies began to issue a new weapon to artillery crews and tank crews  the personal defense weapon  a compact submachine gun like firearm which incorporates some of the advantages of a carbine  in that it can fire armor piercing  higher powered ammunition  Unlike the machine pistol  which is a relative of the semi automatic pistol  the PDW is more like a scaled down rifle   Military machine pistols usually use fully jacketed ammunition in accordance with the Hague convention  Fully jacketed cartridges are less likely to become deformed and flattened on impact  which means that permanent cavitation inflicted on human tissue  and therefore the damage that they do to the body  is moderated  Some special forces use specialty ammunition in machine pistols or PDWs  such as loading several tracer rounds per magazine to aid in night time shooting  or for a squad leader to direct his soldiers  attention toward a location for concentrated fire   3 2  Law enforcement  Government security service bodyguards for VIPs security are sometimes issued machine pistols rather than submachine guns for tactical and media considerations  Whereas a team of bodyguards carrying larger submachine guns may indicate to would be aggressors that the VIP is an important politician  a machine pistol such as the Glock 18 can be concealed in a standard holster  Since even the unholstered weapon is indistinguishable to most observers from a standard pistol  this may lessen attention from media or potential attackers as to the security measures that are in place   When bodyguards are carrying a machine pistol in a concealed holster  they have to choose a weapon that does not have parts that might snag when the weapon is being withdrawn from the holster  For similar reasons  a bodyguard with a holster carried  concealed weapon is typically not able to mount accessories onto the weapon  such as optical sights or forward handgrips  The exception is cases in which a bodyguard conceals the weapon in a briefcase   Law enforcement agencies use machine pistols for hostage rescues and for breaching gang compounds because the weapons offer a very high rate of fire in a small weapon  which can be maneuvered inside houses and stairwells  places where an assault carbine such as the Colt M4 would be unwieldy  Another reason that law enforcement agencies use machine pistols in hostage rescue situations is that the low powered pistol ammunition loses its energy quickly  which means that the bullets are less likely to go through walls and injure innocent parties  Some Mexican police officers working in urban environments carry both a 9 mm machine pistol and a standard semi automatic side arm   Air marshals who provide security on private airplanes also carry machine pistols and may use speciality ammunition such as frangible bullets  which break apart when upon impact  Frangible bullets such as the Glaser Safety Slug are designed to ricochet less and be less likely to puncture the hull of an aircraft  which lessens the danger of decompression if the officer has to fire on an attacker   When law enforcement agencies are using machine pistols in non concealed settings  this makes it feasible to add accessories such as optical sights  laser sights  flashlights  forward handgrips  rear stocks  or sound suppressors  Many 2000s era machine pistols have mounting rails to facilitate the addition of accessories  Agencies sometimes use sound suppressors for maneuvers in which it is anticipated that shots may be fired indoors  because the sound pressure from indoor firing can be deafening  Some machine pistols offer the option of using translucent plastic magazines which allows the officer to quickly verify the level of ammunition left in the magazine  Another option that law enforcement officers may use on occasion is high capacity magazines such as single or double drum magazines   Different law enforcement agencies in different countries have different regulations regarding how machine pistols are loaded and carried  Depending on the type of machine pistol  some agencies train their officers to carry the weapon with a round in the chamber  the weapon cocked and the safety on  Other agencies may prefer that officers carry the weapon without a round in the chamber  While this makes the weapon safer to carry and reduces the likelihood of an accidental discharge  it also means that there will be a longer delay before the officer can fire the weapon   Agencies also have different training doctrines regarding how the weapon is drawn and brought into position onto the target  Variants include withdrawing the weapon while pointing it downwards  then bringing it up towards the target  the same method but pointing the weapon upwards  and bringing it down towards the target  and the cross body draw  The first method may be safer  in that if there are any unintended discharges  they will go into the ground  With a machine pistol that can empty its 20 round magazine in a second and a half  bringing the weapon into play by moving it down onto the target or using a cross body draw could result in unintended injuries if the weapon accidentally discharges   3 3  Criminal use  3 3 1  MAC 10 and TEC 9  In the decades after the 1980s  there were newspaper reports about the use of the MAC 10 or the Tec 9 in crimes  including gang related crimes and its use by Dylan Klebold in the Columbine High School massacre  The Tec 9  known as the AB 10 after 1994   is sold as a semi automatic weapon  not a machine pistol  Klebold s pistol was  in fact  a post ban AB 10  The majority of criminal uses of the MAC 10 11 and Tec 9 style firearms involve unconverted  semi automatic versions  Failure to differentiate between the two has led to some confusion over what constitutes a true machine pistol  especially among the news media   The fully automatic MAC 10 is a submachine gun  not a machine pistol  Though semi automatic versions of the gun were sold without a stock and later converted  either legally or illegally  to full auto  their classification would still be a submachine gun with the stock removed  Confusion is rampant due to the identical outward appearance of the firearms   3 4  Other types  In September 1997 The Gazette from Montreal reported that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  RCMP  had arrested a Canadian gang operating a gun running ring in Ontario and Quebec  The ring sold  high calibre  machine guns  machine pistols  handguns  explosives  500 pounds of C 4 plastic explosive  and thousands of rounds of ammunition to biker gangs and other criminals  The Canadian Department of Justice stated in 1998 that as the preferred weapons of drug dealers are illegal in Canada  they are obtained by smuggling   A Canadian undercover officer interviewed on the issue of guns and the illegal drug trade      noted that the weaponry in the trade is definitely more powerful than in previous years   with an increasing number of criminals using machine pistols and submachine guns  He stated that within the drug trade firearms are used as status symbols  a means of protection and     for executions      and  to intimidate potential informants and to enforce debt repayment    During the 1990s in Croatia   illicit copies  of  machine pistols were manufactured locally   including the  ‘ERO’  an exact copy of the Israeli UZI machine pistol   These illegally made Croatian weapons  also ended up in the Dutch criminal world  between 1998 and 2000  a couple dozen ‘Croatian UZIs’ were seized   In Croatia   machine pistols of the American Ingram brand  were also illegally copied and manufactured   In Serbia on 3 August 2001  assailants gunned down Momir Gavrilovic on the asphalt of a parking lot in New Belgrade  with a  7 65mm ‘scorpion’ machine pistol and  he  died on the spot    The crime came to national attention only five days later   Gavrilovic was  a former member of Serbian State Security   who shortly before his death had      provided documentary evidence of corruption  even naming names    4  Criticism  Machine pistols have long been criticized for their inaccuracy  The inaccuracy of most machine pistols occurs because it is hard to control a fully automatic weapon that has such a low weight and in many cases  lacks a proper shoulder stock  As a result  in the hands of all but the most expert shooters  machine pistols being fired on full automatic tend to rise up during firing  Machine pistols also tend to have a very short sight radius  meaning that the effectiveness beyond 50 meters degrades rapidly  One solution to improve controllability is the use of burst limiters  Commonly  three or two round bursts are used  Another solution is to steady the weapon in some fashion  either by outfitting it with a shoulder stock  using a shoulder strap to pull down on the front of the barrel  or resting the weapon against a hard surface which can be used as a bracing point  Slower rates of fire also allow better controllability  Use of a ported barrel  muzzle brake or suppressor can further be used to reduce muzzle climb   Gunsite  a US firearms training facility  decided against teaching machine pistol firing when it was founded in 1976  Facility experts believed that it is  a slob s weapon  useful only by half trained or poorly motivated troops   they claimed that the machine pistol  hits no harder than a pistol and is no more portable than a rifle   Nevertheless  even the critics from Gunsite concede that the machine pistol is useful for a few situations  such as boarding an enemy boat in low light or when repelling boarders in a naval situation  Walt Rauch notes that      despite the 50 to 70 years of bad press that has accrued to the concept of shooting a hand held machine pistol   in which critics contend that the weapon will  spray bullets indiscriminately all over the area   he believes that the 2000s era models such as the Glock 18 are controllable and accurate in full auto shooting  A SWAT magazine article on machine pistols states that when serving as security detail   where we had Beretta 92s  we would try to grab at least one 93R 20 round mag to carry as a spare for breaking ambushes    5  See also  Firearm action  List of submachine guns  Personal defense weapon  6  References  7  Further reading  Mullin
