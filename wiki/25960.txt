A rotary dial is a component of a telephone or a telephone switchboard that implements a signaling technology in telecommunications known as pulse dialing  It is used when initiating a telephone call to transmit the destination telephone number to a telephone exchange   On the rotary dial  the digits are arranged in a circular layout so that a finger wheel may be rotated with one finger from the position of each digit to a fixed stop position  implemented by the finger stop  which is a mechanical barrier to prevent further rotation  When released at the finger stop  the wheel returns to its home position by spring action at a speed regulated by a governor device  During this return rotation  the dial interrupts the direct electrical current of the telephone line  local loop  a specific number of times for each digit and thereby generates electrical pulses which the telephone exchange decodes into each dialed digit  Each of the ten digits are encoded in sequences of up to ten pulses  For this reason  the method is sometimes called decadic dialling   The first patent for a rotary dial was filed by Almon Brown Strowger on December 21  1891  which was awarded to him on November 29  1892 as   The early forms of a rotary dial used lugs on a finger plate instead of holes and the pulse train was generated without the control of spring action or a governor on the forward movement of the wheel  which proved to be difficult to operate correctly  The commonly known appearance of the rotary dial with finger holes was first introduced in 1904 but did not enter service in the Bell System in the United States until 1919  when AT&T abandoned its determined reliance on manual exchanges  and embraced automatic switching   From the 1960s onward  the rotary dial was gradually supplanted by dual tone multi frequency push button dialing  first introduced to the public at the 1962 World s Fair under the trade name  Touch Tone   Touch tone technology primarily used a keypad in form of a rectangular array of push buttons for dialing   1  History  From as early as 1836 onward  various suggestions and inventions of dials for sending telegraph signals were reported  After the first commercial telephone exchange was installed in 1878  the need for an automated  user controlled method of directing a telephone call became apparent  Addressing the technical shortcomings  Almon Brown Strowger invented a telephone dial in 1891  Before 1891  numerous competing inventions  and 26 patents for dials  push buttons  and similar mechanisms  specified methods of signalling a destination telephone station that a subscriber wanted to call  Most inventions involved costly  intricate mechanisms and required the user to perform complex manipulations   The first commercial installation of a telephone dial accompanied the first commercial installation of a 99 line automatic telephone exchange in La Porte  Indiana in 1892  which was based on the 1891 Strowger designs  The original dials required complex operational sequences and development continued during the 1890s and early 1900s in conjunctions with improvements in switching technology   In the 1950s  plastic materials were introduced in dial construction  replacing metal which was heavier and subject to higher wear   Despite their lack of modern features  rotary phones occasionally find special uses  For instance  the anti drug Fairlawn Coalition of the Anacostia section of Washington  D C  persuaded the phone company to reinstall rotary dial pay phones in the 1980s to discourage loitering by drug purchasers  since the dials could not be used to call dealers  pagers  They are also retained for authenticity in historic properties such as the U S  Route 66 Blue Swallow Motel which date from an era of named exchanges and pulse dialling   2  Construction  A rotary dial typically features a circular construction  The shaft that actuates the mechanical switching mechanism is driven by the finger wheel  a disk that has ten finger holes aligned close to the circumference  the finger wheel may be transparent or opaque permitting the viewing of the face plate  or number plate below  either in whole  or only showing the number assignment for each finger hole  The faceplate is printed with numbers  and sometimes letters  corresponding to each finger hole  The 1 is normally set at approximately 60 degrees clockwise from the uppermost point of the dial  or approximately at the 2 o clock position  and then the numbers progress counterclockwise  with the 0 being at about 5 o clock  A curved device called a finger stop sits above the dial at approximately the 4 o clock position  The physical nature of the dialing mechanism on rotary phones allowed the use of physical locking mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use  The lock could be integral to the phone itself or a separate device inserted through the finger hole nearest the finger stop to prevent the dial rotating   2 1  Letters  In addition to the numbers  the faceplate is often printed with letters corresponding to each finger hole  In North America  traditional dials have letter codes displayed with the numbers under the finger holes in the following pattern  1  2 ABC  3 DEF  4 GHI  5 JKL  6 MNO  7 PRS  8 TUV  9 WXY  and 0  sometimes Z  Operator  Letters were associated with the dial numbers to represent telephone exchange names in communities having more than 9 999 telephone lines  and additionally given a meaningful mnemonic to facilitate memorization of individual telephone numbers by incorporating their exchange names  For example   RE7 xxxx  represented  REgent 7 xxxx    Regent  being a local exchange name used in Canada  derived from an earlier precursor telephone number   7xxxx  –with callers actually dialing  73 7xxxx   737 xxxx    In the United Kingdom the letter  O  was combined with the digit  0  rather than  6   Older Australian rotary dial telephones also had letters  but the combinations were often printed in the center plate adjacent to the number  The Australian letter to number mapping was  A 1  B 2  F 3  J 4  L 5  M 6  U 7  W 8  X 9  Y 0  so the phone number BX 3701 was in fact 29 3701  When Australia changed to all numeric telephone numbers  a mnemonic to help people associate letters with numbers was the sentence   All Big Fish Jump Like Mad Under Water eXcept Yabbies   However  such letter codes were not used in all countries   Dials outside Canada  the United States  and large cities in Britain  before all figure dialing  usually did not bear alphabetic characters or an indication of the word  operator  in addition to numbers  Alphabetic designation of exchanges with Cyrillic letters  А  Б  В  Г  Д  Е  Ж  И  К  Л for each of the digits from 1 through 0 respectively  was also used for a short period in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s  but by the next decade this practice was largely discontinued   New Zealand letter for number has 2 ABC 3

user then pulls out the finger  and a spring in the dial returns it to the resting position  For example  if the user dials  6  on a North American phone  electrical contacts wired through the cam mechanism inside the phone will open and close six times as the dial returns to home position  thus sending six pulses to the central office   Different pulse systems are used  varying from country to country  For example  Sweden uses one pulse to signal the number zero  and 10 pulses to signal the number nine  New Zealand uses ten pulses minus the number desired  so dialing 7 produces three pulses  In Norway  the North American system with the number  1  corresponding to one pulse was used  except for the capital  Oslo  which used the same  inverse  system as in New Zealand   For this reason  the numbers on the dial are shifted in different countries  or even in different areas of one country  to work with their system because of the difference of the number arrangement on the dial  The dial numbering can occur in four different formats  with 0 adjacent either to the 1 or the 9 and the numbers running in ascending or descending order with either the 0 1 or 9 being closest to the finger stop   A relic of these differences is found in emergency telephone numbers used in various countries  the United Kingdom selected 999 due to the ease of converting call office dials to make free calls   0  for the Operator was already free  and the cam that removed the shunt on the line when the dial was rotated to the  0  position could be altered to include the adjacent digit  9   and  8  if required  so that calls to  0  and  999  could be made without inserting coins  In New Zealand 111 was selected for the same reason  on New Zealand reverse numbered dials each digit  1  sends 9 pulses to the central office telephone exchange  like  9  in Britain    Early dials worked by direct or forward action  The pulses were generated as the dial turned toward the finger stop position  When the user s hand motion was erratic  it produced wrong numbers  In the late 19th century  the dial was refined to operate automatically by a recoil spring  The user selected the digit to be dialed  rotated the dial to the finger stop  then released it  The spring caused the dial to rotate back to its home position during which time constant speed was maintained with a centrifugal governor   Dials at user stations typically produced pulses at the rate of ten pulses per second  pps   while dials on operator consoles on Crossbar or electronic exchanges often pulsed at 20 pps  The rotary dial governor is subject to wear and aging  and may require periodic cleaning  lubrication and adjustment by a telephone technician  In the video  the green LED shows the dial impulse pulses and the red LED shows the dial s off normal contact function   Off normal contacts typically serve two additional functions  They may implement a shunt across the transmitter circuit and induction coil to maximize the pulsing signal of the dial by eliminating all internal impedances of the telephone set  Another function is to short circuit the telephone receiver during dialing  to prevent audible clicking noise from being heard by the telephone user   Some telephones include a small dial built into the handset  with a movable finger stop  The user rotates the dial clockwise until the finger stop ceases moving  then releases both  In this setting  there is no section of the rotating dial plate without holes  allowing a smaller dial diameter  This was introduced by Western Electric on the compact Trimline telephone  the first to locate the dial in the handset  In Spain  such phones were manufactured for CTNE  Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España  by Málaga based factory  CITESA   being named as  Góndola  phones by its particular shape  Spanish Góndola sets were fitted from the beginning with a red LED series connected with the line  allowing the dial   disco  in Spanish  to be back lighted while dialling  For that  the LED was bridged by an anti parallel Zener diode  to allow the DC to pass even if the line polarity were reversed  In case of line polarity reversal  the LED would not light  but the phone would work anyway  The LED and Zener diode were contained in the same package for ease of assembly in manufacturing   Rotary dial telephones in Australia were sometimes equipped  in later years  with touch pad blanks  designed to look like a touch phone  but providing the rotary dial signalling required by the Australian phone system  This was also the case with a number of sets offered in the UK and other countries  most being identified by the lack of # and * keys   Rotary dial telephones have no redial feature  the complete number has to be dialed for every attempted call   Since the 1950s  telephones in the United States and elsewhere were redesigned with the numbers and letters on a ring outside the finger wheel to provide better visibility   4  See
