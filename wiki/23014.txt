Poker is a family of card games involving betting and individual play  whereby the winner is determined by the ranks and combinations of players  cards  some of which remain hidden until the end of the game  Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt  the number of shared or  community  cards  and the number of cards that remain hidden  The betting procedures vary among different poker games in such ways as betting limits and splitting the pot between a high hand and a low hand   In most modern poker games  the first round of betting begins with one of the players making some form of a forced bet  the blind and or ante   In standard poker  each player bets according to the rank he believes his hand is worth as compared to the other players  The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match  or  call   the maximum previous bet or fold  losing the amount bet so far and all further interest in the hand  A player who matches a bet may also  raise   or increase the bet  The betting round ends when all players have either matched the last bet or folded  If all but one player folds on any round  the remaining player collects the pot and may choose to show or conceal his hand  If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round  the hands are revealed  and the player with the winning hand takes the pot  With the exception of initial forced bets  money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various strategic reasons  Thus  while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance  the long run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability  psychology  and game theory   Poker has gained in popularity since the beginning of the twentieth century and has gone from being primarily a recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts to a widely popular activity  both for participants and spectators  including online  with many professional players and multimillion dollar tournament prizes   1  History  English actor Joseph Cowell reported in his memoirs that the game was played in New Orleans  Louisiana in 1829  with a deck of 20 cards  and four players betting on which player s hand was the most valuable  Jonathan H  Green s book  An Exposure of the Arts and Miseries of Gambling  G  B  Zieber  Philadelphia  1843   described the spread of the game from there to the rest of the country by Mississippi riverboats  on which gambling was a common pastime  As it spread north along the Mississippi River and to the West during the gold rush  it is thought to have become a part of the frontier pioneer ethos   Soon after this spread  the full 52 card English deck was used and the flush was introduced  The draw was added prior to 1850  when it was first mentioned in print in a handbook of games   During the American Civil War  many additions were made including stud poker  specifically five card stud  and the straight  Further American developments followed  such as the wild card  around 1875   lowball and split pot poker  around 1900   and community card poker games  around 1925    Modern tournament play became popular in American casinos after the World Series of Poker  WSOP  began in 1970  Notable champions from these early WSOP tournaments include Johnny Moss  Amarillo Slim  Bobby Baldwin  Doyle Brunson  and Puggy Pearson  Later in the 1970s  the first serious poker strategy books appeared  notably Super System by Doyle Brunson  ISBN 1 58042 081 8  and Caro s Book of Poker Tells by Mike Caro  ISBN 0 89746 100 2   followed later by The Theory of Poker by David Sklansky  ISBN 1 880685 00 0   By the 1980s  poker was being depicted in popular culture as a commonplace recreational activity  For example  it was featured in at least 10 episodes of Star Trek  The Next Generation as a weekly event of the senior staff of the fictional ship s crew  In the 1990s  poker and casino gambling spread across the United States  most notably to Atlantic City  New Jersey   Poker s popularity experienced an unprecedented spike at the beginning of the 21st century  largely because of the introduction of online poker and hole card cameras  which turned the game into a spectator sport  Not only could viewers now follow the action and drama of the game on television  but they could also play the game in the comfort of their own homes  Also in the 2003 World Series of Poker  Chris Moneymaker  who was an accountant and not a professional poker player  won the main event  He won his seat into the $10 000 tournament via a $40 multi table satellite  smaller buy in tournaments where a player can play and win a seat in the bigger buy in tournaments  and turned his $40 into $2 5 million  This helped popularize the game further  which became known as the  Moneymaker effect    Following the surge in popularity  new poker tours soon emerged  notably the World Poker Tour and European Poker Tour  both televised and the latter sponsored by online poker company PokerStars  Subsequent tours have since been created by PokerStars  such as Latin American Poker Tour and Asia Pacific Poker Tour  as well as other national tours   In 2009 the International Federation of Poker was founded in Lausanne  Switzerland  becoming the official governing body for poker and promoting the game as a mind sport  In 2011 it announced plans for two new events  The Nations Cup  a duplicate poker team event  to be staged on the London Eye on the banks of the River Thames and “The Table”  the invitation only IFP World Championship  featuring roughly 130 of the world’s best poker players  in an event to find the 2011 official  World Champion    2  Gameplay  In casual play  the right to deal a hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a dealer button  or buck   In a casino  a house dealer handles the cards for each hand  but the button  typically a white plastic disk  is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting  The cards are dealt clockwise around the poker table  one at a time   One or more players are usually required to make forced bets  usually either an ante or a blind bet  sometimes both   The dealer shuffles the cards  the player on the chair to his right cuts  and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time  beginning with the player to his left  Cards may be dealt either face up or face down  depending on the variant of poker being played  After the initial deal  the first of what may be several betting rounds begins  Between rounds  the players  hands develop in some way  often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt  At the end of each round  all bets are gathered into the central pot   At any time during a betting round  if one player bets  no opponents choose to call  match  the bet  and all opponents instead fold  the hand ends immediately  the bettor is awarded the pot  no cards are required to be shown  and the next hand begins  This is what makes bluffing possible  Bluffing is a primary feature of poker  one that distinguishes it from other vying games and from other games that make use of poker hand rankings   At the end of the last betting round  if more than one player remains  there is a showdown  in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands  The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot  A poker hand comprises five cards  in variants where a player has more than five cards  the best five cards play   3  Variants  Poker has many variations  all following a similar pattern of play and generally using the same hand ranking hierarchy  There are four main families of variants  largely grouped by the protocol of card dealing and betting    Straight  A complete hand is dealt to each player  and players bet in one round  with raising and re raising allowed  This is the oldest poker family  the root of the game as now played was a game known as Primero  which evolved into the game three card brag  a very popular gentleman s game around the time of the American Revolutionary War and still enjoyed in the U K  today  Straight hands of five cards are sometimes used as a final showdown  but poker is almost always played in a more complex form to allow for additional strategy   Stud poker  Cards are dealt in a prearranged combination of face down and face up rounds  or streets  with a round of betting following each  This is the next oldest family  as poker progressed from three to five card hands  they were often dealt one card at a time  either face down or face up  with a betting round between each  The most popular stud variant today  seven card stud  deals two extra cards to each player  three face down  four face up  from which they must make the best possible 5 card hand   Draw poker  A complete hand is dealt to each player  face down  and after betting  players are allowed to attempt to change their hand  with the object of improving it  by discarding unwanted cards and being dealt new ones  Five card draw is the most famous variation in this family   Community card poker  Also known as  flop poker   community card poker is a variation of stud poker  Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face down cards  and then a number of face up community cards are dealt to the center of the table  each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a 5 card hand  Texas hold  em and Omaha are two well known variants of the community card family   Other games that use poker hand rankings may likewise be referred to as poker  Video poker is a single player video game that functions much like a slot machine  most video poker machines play draw poker  where the player bets  a hand is dealt  and the player can discard and replace cards  Payout is dependent on the hand resulting after the draw and the player s initial bet   Strip poker is a traditional poker variation where players remove clothing when they lose bets  Since it depends only on the basic mechanic of betting in rounds  strip poker can be played with any form of poker  however  it is usually based on simple variants with few betting rounds  like five card draw   Another game with the poker name  but with a vastly different mode of play  is called Acey Deucey or Red Dog poker  This game is more similar to Blackjack in its layout and betting  each player bets against the house  and then is dealt two cards  For the player to win  the third card dealt  after an opportunity to raise the bet  must have a value in between the first two  Payout is based on the odds that this is possible  based on the difference in values of the first two cards  Other poker like games played at casinos against the house include three card poker and pai gow poker   4  Computer programs  In 2015  scientists said they have created a computer program that is the  perfect  poker player for two handed limit Texas hold  em  They said the program never makes a mistake and employs an algorithm with a strategy the scientists maintained is  close to optimal    5  See also  Glossary of poker terms  Online poker  Outline of poker  List of poker hands  Underground poker  6  References  7  External links
