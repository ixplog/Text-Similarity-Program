The Kickapoo people  Kickapoo  Kiikaapoa or Kiikaapoi  are an Algonquian speaking Native American tribe  Anishinaabeg say the name  Kickapoo   Giiwigaabaw in the Anishinaabe language and its Kickapoo cognate Kiwikapawa  means  Stands here and there   which may have referred to the tribe s migratory patterns  The name can also mean  wanderer   This interpretation is contested and generally believed to be a folk etymology   Today there are three federally recognized Kickapoo tribes in the United States  Kickapoo Tribe of Indians of the Kickapoo Reservation in Kansas  the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma  and the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas  The Oklahoma and Texas bands are politically associated with each other  Around 3 000 people are enrolled tribal members  Another band resides in MÃºzquiz Municipality  in the Mexican state of Coahuila   1  History  The earliest European contact with the Kickapoo tribe occurred during the La Salle Expeditions into the Illinois Country in the late 17th century  as the French set up remote fur trading posts throughout the region  including on Wabash River  The Kickapoo at that time inhabited a large territory along the Wabash in the area of modern Terre Haute  Indiana  They were confederated with the larger Wabash Confederacy  that included the Piankeshaw to their south  the Wea to their north  and the powerful Miami Tribe  to their east  A subgroup occupied the Upper Iowa River region in northeast Iowa and the Root River region in southeast Minnesota in the late 1600s and early 1700s  this group was probably known by the clan name  Mahouea   derived from the Illinoian word for wolf  m hwea   As white settlers moved into the region beginning in the early 19th century  the Kickapoo participated in several treaties  including the Treaty of Vincennes  the Treaty of Grouseland  and the Treaty of Fort Wayne  They sold most of their lands to the United States and moved north to settle among the Wea  Rising tensions between the regional tribes and the United States led to Tecumseh s War in 1811  The Kickapoo were one of Tecumseh s closest allies  Many Kickapoo warriors participated in the Battle of Tippecanoe and the subsequent War of 1812  A prominent  nonviolent spiritual leader among the Kickapoo was Kennekuk  who led his followers to their current tribal lands in Kansas  where he died in 1852   The close of the war led to a change of Indian policy in the Indiana Territory  and later the state of Indiana  American leaders began to advocate the removal of the tribes to land west of the Mississippi River  The Kickapoo were among the first tribes to leave Indiana  They accepted land in Kansas and an annual subsidy in exchange for leaving the state The Kickapoo people are known for eating lots of corn  2  Language  Kickapoo speak an Algonquian language closely related to that of the Sauk and Fox  They were classified with the Central Algonquians  and were also related to the Illiniwek     the Kickapoo Nation s School in Horton  Kansas had been teaching the Kickapoo language in grades K 6 for 15 years  In 2010  the Head Start Program at the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas  KTTT  reservation  which teaches the Kickapoo language  became  the first Native American school to earn Texas School Ready   TSR  Project certification   Also in 2010  Mexico s  National Institute of Anthropology and History  INAH  participates in the elaboration of a Kickapoo alphabet that may be used by more than 700 members of the group that dwells Mexico and the United States  in the area of Coahuila and Texas  There is no Kickapoo alphabet in Mexico  although there is a syllabic writing system it has no element ordination  organization or classification method   The Kickapoo in Mexico are known for their whistled speech   The Kickapoo language and members of the Kickapoo tribe were featured in the movie The Only Good Indian  a fictionalized story of Native American children forced to attend a boarding school   Texts  recordings  and a vocabulary of the language are available   3  Kickapoo tribes and communities  There are three federally recognized Kickapoo communities in the United States  one in Kansas  one in Texas  and the third in Oklahoma   3 1  Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Kansas  The Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Kansas is located at in the northeastern part of the state in parts of three counties  Brown  Jackson  and Atchison  It has a land area of and a resident population of 4 419 as of the 2000 census  The largest community on the reservation is the city of Horton  The other communities are   Muscotah  Netawaka  Powhattan  Whiting  Willis  3 2  Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Texas  The Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Texas is located at on the Rio Grande on the U S  Mexico border in western Maverick County  just south of the city of Eagle Pass  as part of the community of Rosita South  It has a land area of and a 2000 census population of 420 persons  The Texas Indian Commission officially recognized the tribe in 1977   There are undetermined numbers of other Kickapoo in Maverick County  Texas  who constitute the  South Texas Subgroup of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma   That band owns of non reservation land in Maverick County  primarily to the north of Eagle Pass  It has an office in that city   3 3  Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma  After being expelled from the Republic of Texas  many Kickapoo moved south to Mexico  but the population of two villages settled in Indian Territory  One village settled within the Chickasaw Nation and the other within the Muscogee Creek Nation  These Kickapoo were granted their own reservation in 1883 and became the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma   The reservation was short lived  because in 1893 their communal tribal lands were broken up and assigned to separate households in allotments under the Dawes Act  The tribe s government was dismantled by the Curtis Act of 1898  which encouraged assimilation by Native Americans  Tribal members struggled under these conditions   In 1936  the tribe reorganized as the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma  under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act   Today the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma is headquartered in McLoud  Oklahoma  Their tribal jurisdictional area is in Oklahoma  Pottawatomie  and Lincoln Counties  They have 2 719 enrolled tribal members   4  See also  Whistled
