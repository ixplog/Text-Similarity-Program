Mandarin      is a group of related varieties of Chinese spoken across most of northern and southwestern China  Because most Mandarin dialects are found in the north  the group is also referred to as the  northern dialect s    When the Mandarin group is taken as one language  as is often done in academic literature  it has more native speakers  nearly a billion  than any other language   A northeastern dialect speaker and a southwestern dialect speaker may have difficulty communicating except through the standard language  Nonetheless  there is much less variation across the huge Mandarin area than between the non Mandarin varieties of southeast China  This is attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south  combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas   For most of Chinese history  the capital has been within the Mandarin area  making these dialects very influential  Some form of Mandarin has served as a national lingua franca since the 14th century  In the early 20th century  a standard form based on the Beijing dialect  with elements from other Mandarin dialects  was adopted as the national language  Standard Chinese  which is also referred to as  Mandarin   is the official language of the People s Republic of China and the Republic of China and one of the four official languages of Singapore  It is also one of the most frequently used varieties of Chinese among Chinese diaspora communities internationally   1  Name  The English word  mandarin   from Portuguese mandarim  from Malay menteri  from Sanskrit mantrin  meaning  minister or counsellor   originally meant an official of the Ming and Qing empires  Since their native varieties were often mutually unintelligible  these officials communicated using a koiné based on various northern varieties  When Jesuit missionaries learned this standard language in the 16th century  they called it  Mandarin   from its Chinese name Guānhuà     or  language of the officials    In everyday English   Mandarin  refers to Standard Chinese  which is often called simply  Chinese   Standard Chinese is based on the particular Mandarin dialect spoken in Beijing  with some lexical and syntactic influence from other Mandarin dialects  It is the official spoken language of the People s Republic of China  PRC   the official language of the Republic of China  ROC Taiwan   and one of the four official languages of the Republic of Singapore  It also functions as the language of instruction in the PRC and in Taiwan  It is one of the six official languages of the United Nations  under the name  Chinese   Chinese speakers refer to the modern standard language as  Pǔtōnghuà    literally  common speech   in China   Guóyǔ    literally  national language   in Taiwan  or  Huáyǔ    in Malaysia  Singapore and Philippines  but not as Guānhuà   This article uses the term  Mandarin  in the sense used by linguists  referring to the diverse group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China  which Chinese linguists call Guānhuà  The alternative term Běifānghuà     or  Northern dialect s    is used less and less among Chinese linguists  By extension  the term  Old Mandarin  is used by linguists to refer to the northern dialects recorded in materials from the Yuan dynasty   Native speakers who are not academic linguists may not recognize that the variants they speak are classified in linguistics as members of  Mandarin   or so called  Northern dialects   in a broader sense  Within Chinese social or cultural discourse  there is not a common  Mandarin  identity based on language  rather  there are strong regional identities centred on individual dialects because of the wide geographical distribution and cultural diversity of their speakers  Speakers of forms of Mandarin other than the standard typically refer to the variety they speak by a geographic name—for example Sichuan dialect  Hebei dialect or Northeastern dialect  all being regarded as distinct from the standard language   As with all other varieties of the Chinese language  there is significant dispute as to whether Mandarin is a language or a dialect  See Varieties of Chinese for more on this issue   2  History  The present Chinese language varieties developed from regional variants of Old Chinese and Middle Chinese  Traditionally  seven major groups of dialects have been recognized  Aside from Mandarin  the other six are Wu  Gan and Xiang in central China  and Min  Hakka and Yue on the southeast coast  More recently  other more specific groups have been recognized   2 1  Old Mandarin  After the fall of the Northern Song dynasty  and during the reign of the Jin  Jurchen  and Yuan  Mongol  dynasties in northern China  a common speech developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital  a language referred to as Old Mandarin  New genres of vernacular literature were based on this language  including verse  drama and story forms  such as the qu and sanqu   The rhyming conventions of the new verse were codified in a rhyme dictionary called the Zhongyuan Yinyun  1324   A radical departure from the rhyme table tradition that had evolved over the previous centuries  this dictionary contains a wealth of information on the phonology of Old Mandarin  Further sources are the  Phags pa script based on the Tibetan alphabet  which was used to write several of the languages of the Mongol empire  including Chinese  and the Menggu Ziyun  a rhyme dictionary based on  Phags pa  The rhyme books differ in some details  but overall show many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects  such as the reduction and disappearance of final plosives and the reorganization of the Middle Chinese tones   In Middle Chinese  initial plosives and affricates showed a three way contrast between tenuis  voiceless aspirated and voiced consonants  There were four tones  with the fourth  or  entering tone   comprising syllables ending in plosives   p   t or  k   Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch  and by the late Tang dynasty  each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials  When voicing was lost in all dialects except the Wu group  this distinction became phonemic  and the system of initials and tones was rearranged differently in each of the major groups   The Zhongyuan Yinyun shows the typical Mandarin four tone system resulting from a split of the  even  tone and loss of the entering tone  with its syllables distributed across the other tones  though their different origin is marked in the dictionary   Similarly  voiced plosives and affricates have become voiceless aspirates in the  even  tone and voiceless non aspirates in others  another distinctive Mandarin development  However  the language still retained a final  m  which has merged with  n in modern dialects  and initial voiced fricatives  It also retained the distinction between velars and alveolar sibilants in palatal environments  which later merged in most Mandarin dialects to yield a palatal series  rendered j   q  and x  in pinyin    The flourishing vernacular literature of the period also shows distinctively Mandarin vocabulary and syntax  though some  such as the third person pronoun tā  他   can be traced back to the Tang dynasty   2 2  Vernacular literature  Until the early 20th century  formal writing and even much poetry and fiction was done in Literary Chinese  which was modelled on the classics of the Warring States period and Han dynasty  Over time  the various spoken varieties diverged greatly from Literary Chinese  which was learned and composed as a special language  Preserved from the sound changes that affected the various spoken varieties  its economy of expression was greatly valued  For instance   yì  wing  is unambiguous in written Chinese  but has over 75 homophones in spoken Mandarin   The literary language was less appropriate for recording materials that were meant to be reproduced in oral presentations  materials such as plays and grist for the professional story teller s mill  From at least the Yuan dynasty  plays that recounted the subversive tales of China s Robin Hoods to the Ming dynasty novels such as Water Margin  on down to the Qing dynasty novel Dream of the Red Chamber and beyond  there developed a literature in written vernacular Chinese    báihuà   In many cases  this written language reflected Mandarin varieties  and since pronunciation differences were not conveyed in this written form  this tradition had a unifying force across all the Mandarin speaking regions and beyond   Hu Shih  a pivotal figure of the first half of the twentieth century  wrote an influential and perceptive study of this literary tradition  entitled Báihuà Wénxuéshǐ  A History of Vernacular Literature    2 3  Koiné of the Late Empire  Until the mid 20th century  most Chinese people living in many parts of southern China spoke only their local language  As a practical measure  officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties  known as Guānhuà  Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career  but it was never formally defined   Officials varied widely in their pronunciation  in 1728  the Yongzheng emperor  unable to understand the accents of officials from Guangdong and Fujian  issued a decree requiring the governors of those provinces to provide for the teaching of proper pronunciation  Although the resulting Academies for Correct Pronunciation    Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn  were short lived  the decree did spawn a number of textbooks that give some insight into the ideal pronunciation  Common features included   loss of the Middle Chinese voiced initials except for v   merger of  m finals with  n  the characteristic Mandarin four tone system in open syllables  but retaining a final glottal stop in  entering tone  syllables  retention of the distinction between palatalized velars and dental affricates  the source of the spellings  Peking  and  Tientsin  for modern  Beijing  and  Tianjin   As the last two of these features indicate  this language was a koiné based on dialects spoken in the Nanjing area  though not identical to any single dialect  This form remained prestigious long after the capital moved to Beijing in 1421  though the speech of the new capital emerged as a rival standard  As late as 1815  Robert Morrison based the first English–Chinese dictionary on this koiné as the standard of the time  though he conceded that the Beijing dialect was gaining in influence  By the middle of the 19th century  the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court   2 4  Standard Chinese  In the early years of the Republic of China  intellectuals of the New Culture Movement  such as Hu Shih and Chen Duxiu  successfully campaigned for the replacement of Literary Chinese as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese  which was based on northern dialects  A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language     After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation  the National Language Unification Commission finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932  The People s Republic founded in 1949 retained this standard  calling it pǔtōnghuà      The national language is now used in education  the media  and formal situations in both the PRC and the R O C   but not in Hong Kong and Macau   This standard can now be spoken intelligibly by most younger people in Mainland China and Taiwan  with various regional accents  In Hong Kong and Macau  because of their colonial and linguistic history  the language of education  the media  formal speech and everyday life remains the local Cantonese  although the standard language is now very influential and taught in schools  In Mandarin speaking areas such as Sichuan  the local dialect is the mother tongue of most of the population  The era of mass education in Standard Chinese has not erased these regional differences  and people may be either diglossic or speak the standard language with a notable accent   From an official point of view  the PRC and ROC governments maintain their own forms of the standard under different names  Technically  both Pǔtōnghuà and Guóyǔ base their phonology on the Beijing accent  though Pǔtōnghuà also takes some elements from other sources  Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences  However  both versions of  school standard  Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin dialects that are spoken in accordance with regional habits  and neither is wholly identical to the Beijing dialect  Pǔtōnghuà and Guóyǔ also have some differences from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary  grammar  and pragmatics   The written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent  although simplified characters are used in Mainland China  Malaysia and Singapore while people in Taiwan  Macau and Hong Kong generally use traditional characters   3  Geographic distribution and dialects  Most Han Chinese living in northern and southwestern China are native speakers of a dialect of Mandarin  The North China Plain provided few barriers to migration  leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China  In contrast  the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese languages  with great internal diversity  particularly in Fujian   However  the varieties of Mandarin cover a huge area containing nearly a billion people  As a result  there are pronounced regional variations in pronunciation  vocabulary  and grammar  and many Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible   Most of northeastern China  except for Liaoning  did not receive significant settlements by Han Chinese until the 18th century  and as a result the Northeastern Mandarin dialects spoken there differ little from Beijing Mandarin  The Manchu people of the area now speak these dialects exclusively  The frontier areas of Northwest and Southwest China were colonized by speakers of Mandarin dialects at the same time  and the dialects in those areas similarly closely resemble their relatives in the core Mandarin area  However  long established cities even very close to Beijing  such as Tianjin  Baoding  Shenyang  and Dalian  have markedly different dialects   Unlike their compatriots on the south east coast  few speakers of Mandarin dialects emigrated from China until the late 20th century  but there are now significant communities of them in cities across the world   3 1  Classification  The classification of Chinese dialects evolved during the 20th century  and many points remain unsettled  Early classifications tended to follow provincial boundaries or major geographical features  In 1936  Wang Li produced the first classification based on phonetic criteria  principally the evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials  His Guānhuà group included dialects of northern and southwestern China  as well as those of Hunan and northern Jiangxi  Li Fang Kuei s classification of 1937 distinguished the latter two groups as Xiang and Gan  while splitting the remaining Guānhuà into Northern  Lower Yangtze and Southwestern Guānhuà groups  The widely accepted seven group classification of Yuan Jiahua in 1960 kept Xiang and Gan separate  with Mandarin divided into Northern  Northwestern  Southwestern and Jiang舑Huai  Lower Yangtze  dialects   The linguist Li Rong proposed that the northwestern dialects of Shanxi and neighbouring areas that retain a final glottal stop in the Middle Chinese entering tone  plosive final  category should constitute a separate top level group called Jin  He used this classification in the Language Atlas of China  1987   Many other linguists continue to include these dialects in the Mandarin group  pointing out that the Jiang舑Huai dialects also retain the glottal stop   The Language Atlas of China calls the remainder of Mandarin a  supergroup   divided into eight dialect groups distinguished by their treatment of the Middle Chinese entering tone  see Tones below    Northeastern  spoken in the northeast of China  Manchuria   except the Liaodong Peninsula  This dialect is closely related to Standard Chinese  with little variation in lexicon and very few tonal differences   Beijing and environs  such as Chengde and Hebei  Beijing dialect forms the basis of Standard Chinese  Some people in areas of recent large scale immigration  such as northern Xinjiang  speak the Beijing dialect or something very close to it   Ji舑Lu  spoken in Hebei   Ji   and Shandong   Lu   provinces  except the Jiaodong Peninsula  including Tianjin dialect  Tones and vocabulary are markedly different  In general  there is little intelligibility with Beijing Mandarin   Jiao舑Liao  spoken in Shandong  Jiaodong  Peninsula and Liaodong Peninsula  Very noticeable tonal changes  different in  flavour  from Ji舑Lu Mandarin  but with more variance  There is significant  but not full intelligibility with Beijing   Zhongyuan  lit   central plain    spoken in Henan province  the central parts of Shaanxi in the Yellow River valley  and southern Xinjiang  There are significant phonological differences  with partial intelligibility with Beijing  The Dungan language spoken in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan belongs to this group  Dungan speakers such as the poet Iasyr Shivaza have reported being understood by speakers of the Beijing dialect  but not vice versa   Lan舑Yin  spoken in Gansu province  with capital Lanzhou  and Ningxia autonomous region  with capital Yinchuan   as well as northern Xinjiang   Jiang舑Huai  or Xiajiang   spoken in the parts of Jiangsu and Anhui on the north bank of the Yangtze  as well as some areas on the south bank  such as Nanjing in Jiangsu  Jiujiang in Jiangxi  etc  There are significant phonological and lexical changes to varied degrees  and intelligibility with Beijing is limited  Jiang舑Huai has been significantly influenced by Wu Chinese   Southwestern  spoken in the provinces of Hubei  Sichuan  Guizhou  Yunnan  and the Mandarin speaking areas of Hunan  Guangxi and southern Shaanxi  There are sharp phonological  lexical  and tonal changes  and intelligibility with Beijing is limited to varying degrees  The Atlas also includes several unclassified Mandarin dialects spoken in scattered pockets across southeastern China  such as Nanping in Fujian and Dongfang on Hainan   4  Phonology  Syllables consist maximally of an initial consonant  a glide  a vowel  a final  and tone  Not every syllable that is possible according to this rule actually exists in Mandarin  as there are rules prohibiting certain phonemes from appearing with others  and in practice there are only a few hundred distinct syllables   Phonological features that are generally shared by the Mandarin dialects include   the palatalization of velars and alveolar sibilants when they occur before palatal glides   the disappearance of final plosives and   m   although in many Jiang舑Huai Mandarin and Jin dialects  an echo of the final plosives is preserved as a glottal stop    the reduction of the six tones inherited from Middle Chinese after the tone split to four tones   the presence of retroflex consonants  although these are absent in many dialects of Southwestern and Northeastern Mandarin    the historical devoicing of plosives and sibilants  also common to most non Mandarin varieties    4 1  Initials  The maximal inventory of initials of a Mandarin dialect is as follows  with bracketed pinyin spellings given for those present in the standard language   Most Mandarin speaking areas distinguish between the retroflex initials from the apical sibilants   though they often have a different distribution than in the standard language  In many dialects of the northeast and southeast the retroflex initials have merged with the alveolar sibilants  so that zhi becomes zi  chi becomes ci  and shi becomes si   The alveolo palatal sibilants are the result of merger between the historical palatalized velars and palatalized alveolar sibilants   In about 20% of dialects  the alveolar sibilants failed to palatalize  remaining separate from the alveolo palatal initials   The unique pronunciation used in Beijing opera falls into this category   On the other side  in some dialects of eastern Shandong  the velar initials have failed to palatalize   Many southwestern Mandarin dialects mix and   substituting one for the other in some or all cases  For example  fei  to fly  and hui  dust  may be merged in these areas   In some dialects  initial and are not distinguished  In Southwestern Mandarin  these sounds usually merge to   in Jiang舑Huai Mandarin  they usually merge to    People in many Mandarin speaking areas may use different initial sounds where Beijing uses initial r    Common variants include     and    Some dialects have initial corresponding to the zero initial of the standard language  This initial is the result of a merger of the Middle Chinese zero initial with and    Many dialects of Northwestern and Central Plains Mandarin have where Beijing has   Examples include  pig  for standard zhū    water  for standard shuǐ    soft  for standard ruǎn    4 2  Finals  Most Mandarin dialects have three medial glides   and  spelled i  u and ü in pinyin   though their incidence varies  The medial   is lost after apical initials in several areas  Thus Southwestern Mandarin has  right  where the standard language has dui   Southwestern Mandarin also has in some words where the standard has jie qie xie   This is a stereotypical feature of southwestern Mandarin  since it is so easily noticeable  E g  hai  shoe  for standard xie  gai  street  for standard jie   Mandarin dialects typically have relatively few vowels  Syllabic fricatives  as in standard zi and zhi  are common in Mandarin dialects  though they also occur elsewhere  The Middle Chinese off glides and are generally preserved in Mandarin dialects  yielding several diphthongs and triphthongs in contrast to the larger sets of monophthongs common in other dialect groups  and some widely scattered Mandarin dialects    The Middle Chinese coda was still present in Old Mandarin  but has merged with in the modern dialects  In some areas  especially the southwest  final has also merged with   This is especially prevalent in the rhyme pairs  en  eng and  in  ing   As a result  jīn  gold  and jīng  capital  merge in those dialects   The Middle Chinese final stops have undergone a variety of developments in different Mandarin dialects  see Tones below   In Jiang舑Huai dialects and some north western dialects they have merged as a final glottal stop  In other dialects they have been lost  with varying effects on the vowel  As a result  Beijing Mandarin and Northeastern Mandarin underwent more vowel mergers than many other varieties of Mandarin  For example   R coloring  a characteristic feature of Mandarin  works quite differently in the southwest  Whereas Beijing dialect generally removes only a final or when adding the rhotic final  r   in the southwest the  r replaces nearly the entire rhyme   4 3  Tones  In general  no two Mandarin speaking areas have exactly the same set of tone values  but most Mandarin speaking areas have very similar tone distribution  For example  the dialects of Jinan  Chengdu  Xi an and so on all have four tones that correspond quite well to the Beijing tones of  55    35    214   and  51   The exception to this rule lies in the distribution of syllables formerly ending in a stop consonant  which are treated differently in different dialects of Mandarin   Middle Chinese stops and affricates had a three way distinction between tenuis  voiceless aspirate and voiced  or breathy voiced  consonants  In Mandarin dialects the voicing is generally lost  yielding voiceless aspirates in syllables with a Middle Chinese level tone and non aspirates is other syllables  Of the four tones of Middle Chinese  the level  rising and departing tones have also developed into four modern tones in a uniform way across Mandarin dialects  the Middle Chinese level tone has split into two registers  conditioned on voicing of the Middle Chinese initial  while rising tone syllables with voiced obstruent initials have shifted to the departing tone  The following examples from the standard language illustrate the regular development common to Mandarin dialects  recall that pinyin d denotes a non aspirate   while t denotes an aspirate     In traditional Chinese phonology  syllables that ended in a stop in Middle Chinese  i e   p    t  or  k   were considered to belong to a special category known as the  entering tone   These final stops have disappeared in most Mandarin dialects  with the syllables distributed over the other four modern tones in different ways in the various Mandarin subgroups  In the Beijing dialect that underlies the standard language  syllables beginning with original voiceless consonants were redistributed across the four tones in a completely random pattern  For example  the three characters   all tsjek in Middle Chinese  William H  Baxter s transcription   are now pronounced jī  jǐ and jì respectively  Older dictionaries such as Mathews  Chinese–English Dictionary mark characters whose pronunciation formerly ended with a plosive with a superscript 5  however  this tone number is more commonly used for syllables that always have a neutral tone  see below    In Jiang舑Huai dialects  a minority of Southwestern dialects  e g  Minjiang  and Jin  sometimes considered non Mandarin   former final plosives were not deleted entirely  but were reduced to a glottal stop   This development is shared with the non Mandarin Wu dialects  and is thought to represent the pronunciation of Old Mandarin  In line with traditional Chinese phonology  dialects such as Jiang舑Huai and Minjiang are thus said to have five tones instead of four  However  modern linguistics considers these syllables as having no phonemic tone at all   While the system of tones is common across Mandarin dialects  their realization as tone contours varies widely   Dialects in and around the Nantong area typically have many more than 4 tones  due to influence from the neighbouring Wu dialects   Mandarin dialects frequently employ neutral tones in the second syllables of words  creating syllables whose tone contour is so short and light that it is difficult or impossible to discriminate  These atonal syllables also occur in non Mandarin dialects  but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear   5  Vocabulary  There are more polysyllabic words in Mandarin than in all other major varieties of Chinese except Shanghainese  This is partly because Mandarin has undergone many more sound changes than have southern varieties of Chinese  and has needed to deal with many more homophones  New words have been formed by adding affixes such as lao   老    zi  子     e r  兒 儿   and  tou  頭 头   or by compounding  e g  by combining two words of similar meaning as in cōngmáng  匆忙   made from elements meaning  hurried  and  busy   A distinctive feature of southwestern Mandarin is its frequent use of noun reduplication  which is hardly used in Beijing  In Sichuan  one hears baobao  handbag  where Beijing uses bao r  There are also a small number of words that have been polysyllabic since Old Chinese  such as húdié  蝴蝶   butterfly    The singular pronouns in Mandarin are wǒ  我   I   nǐ  你 妳   you   nín  您   you  formal    and tā  他 她 它   he she it   with  men  們 们  added for the plural  Further  there is a distinction between the plural first person pronoun zánmen  咱們 咱们   which is inclusive of the listener  and wǒmen  我們 我们   which may be exclusive of the listener  Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns  While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese  the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation  e g   Shanghainese has 侬 儂 non  you  and 伊 yi  he she     Because of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples  Mandarin  especially the Northeastern varieties  has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese  such as hútòng  胡同   alley   Southern Chinese varieties have borrowed from Tai  Austroasiatic  and Austronesian languages   In general  the greatest variation occurs in slang  in kinship terms  in names for common crops and domesticated animals  for common verbs and adjectives  and other such everyday terms  The least variation occurs in  formal  vocabulary—terms dealing with science  law  or government   6  Grammar  Chinese varieties of all periods have traditionally been considered prime examples of analytic languages  relying on word order and particles instead of inflection or affixes to provide grammatical information such as person  number  tense  mood  or case  Although modern varieties  including the Mandarin dialects  use a small number of particles in a similar fashion to suffixes  they are still strongly analytic   The basic word order of subject–verb–object is common across Chinese dialects  but there are variations in the order of the two objects of ditransitive sentences  In northern dialects the indirect object precedes the direct object  as in English   for example in the Standard Chinese sentence   In southern dialects  as well as many southwestern and Jiang舑Huai dialects  the objects occur in the reverse order  Most varieties of Chinese use post verbal particles to indicate aspect  but the particles used vary  Most Mandarin dialects use the particle  le  了  to indicate the perfective aspect and  zhe  著 着  for the progressive aspect  Other Chinese varieties tend to use different particles  e g  Cantonese jo2 咗 and gan2 緊 紧 respectively  The experiential aspect particle  guo  過 过  is used more widely  except in Southern Min   The subordinative particle de  的  is characteristic of Mandarin dialects  Some southern dialects  and a few Jiang舑Huai dialects  preserve an older pattern of subordination without a marking particle  while in others a classifier fulfils the role of the Mandarin particle   Especially in conversational Chinese  sentence final particles alter the inherent meaning of a sentence  Like much vocabulary  particles can vary a great deal with regards to the locale  For example  the particle ma  嘛   which is used in most northern dialects to denote obviousness or contention  is replaced by yo  哟  in southern usage   7  See also  Chinese dictionary  Transcription into Chinese characters  Written Chinese  List of languages by number of
