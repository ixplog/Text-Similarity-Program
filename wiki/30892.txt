cobbled streets  open spaces and Georgian architecture  Places of interest include the Royal Cornwall Museum  the Hall for Cornwall  Cornwall s Courts of Justice and Cornwall Council   1  Toponymy  The origin of Truro s name is debated  It is said to be derived from the Cornish tri veru meaning  three rivers   but references such as the Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names reject this theory  The  tru  part might mean  three   though this is doubtful  An expert on Cornish place names  Oliver Padel  in his book A Popular Dictionary of Cornish Place names wrote that the  three rivers  meaning is  possible   Alternatively the name may derive from *tre uro or similar  i e  the settlement on the river *uro  2  History  The earliest records and archaeological findings of a permanent settlement in the Truro area originate from Norman times  A castle was built in the 12th century by Richard de Luci  Chief Justice of England in the reign of Henry II  who was granted land in Cornwall for his services to the court  including the area surrounding the confluence of the two rivers  The town grew in the shadow of the castle and was awarded borough status to further economic activity   The castle has long since gone    By the start of the 14th century Truro was an important port  due to its inland location away from invaders  prosperity from the fishing industry  and its new role as one of Cornwall s stannary towns for assaying and stamping tin and copper from Cornish mines  The Black Death arrived and with it  a trade recession  resulting in a mass exodus of the population  and the town was left in a very neglected state   Trade gradually returned and the town became prosperous during the Tudor period  Self governance was awarded in 1589 when a new charter was granted by Elizabeth I  which gave Truro an elected mayor and control over the port of Falmouth   During the Civil War in the 17th century  Truro raised a sizeable force to fight for the king and a royalist mint was set up  Defeat by the Parliamentary troops came in 1646 and the mint was moved to Exeter  Later in the century Falmouth was awarded its own charter giving it rights to its harbour  starting a long rivalry between the two towns  The dispute was settled in 1709 with control of the River Fal divided between Truro and Falmouth  The arms of the city of Truro are Gules the base wavy of six Argent and Azure  thereon an ancient ship of three masts under sail  on each topmast a banner of St George  on the waves in base two fishes of the second   Truro prospered greatly during the 18th and 19th centuries  Industry flourished thanks to improved mining methods and higher prices for tin  and the town soon became the place to be for wealthy mine owners  Elegant Georgian and Victorian townhouses were built  such as those seen today on Lemon Street  named after the mining magnate and local MP Sir William Lemon  Truro became the centre for high society in the county  being mentioned as  the London of Cornwall    Throughout these prosperous times Truro remained a social centre and many notable people hailed from it  One of the most noteworthy residents was Richard Lander  an explorer who discovered the source of the River Niger in Africa and was awarded the first gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society  Henry Martyn read mathematics at Cambridge  was ordained and became a missionary  translating the New Testament into Urdu and Persian  Others include Humphry Davy  educated in Truro and the inventor of the miner s safety lamp  and Samuel Foote  an actor and playwright from Boscawen Street   Truro s importance increased later in the 19th century and it had its own iron smelting works  potteries  and tanneries  The Great Western Railway arrived in Truro in the 1860s with a direct line from London Paddington  and the Bishopric of Truro Act 1876 which gave the town a bishop  then a cathedral  The next year Queen Victoria granted Truro city status   The start of the 20th century saw a decline of the mining industry  however the city remained prosperous as its previous role as a market town shifted to being the administrative and commercial centre of Cornwall  and the city saw substantial development  Today  Truro continues its role as the retail centre of Cornwall but  like many other cities  faces concerns over the replacement of many of its renowned speciality shops by national chain stores  the erosion of its identity  and also over how to accommodate expected growth in the 21st century   3  Geography  Truro is located in the centre of western Cornwall  about 9 miles  14 km  from the south coast on the confluence of the rivers Kenwyn and Allen  which combine to become the Truro River  one of a series of creeks  rivers and drowned valleys leading into the River Fal and then to the large natural harbour of Carrick Roads  The river valleys form a bowl surrounding the city on the north  east and west and open to the Truro River in the south  The fairly steep sided bowl in which Truro is located  along with high precipitation swelling the rivers and a spring tide in the River Fal  were major factors in the cause of floods seen in 1988 which seriously damaged the city centre  Since then  flood defences have been constructed around the city  including an emergency dam at New Mill on the River Kenwyn and a tidal barrier on the Truro River  to prevent future problems   The city is surrounded by a number of protected natural areas such as the historic parklands at Pencalenick  and larger areas of ornamental landscape  such as Trelissick Garden and Tregothnan further down the Truro River  An area south east of the city  around and including Calenick Creek  has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty  Other protected areas include an Area of Great Landscape Value comprising agricultural land and wooded valleys to the north east  and Daubuz Moors  a Local Nature Reserve alongside the River Allen close to the city centre   Truro has mainly grown and developed around the historic city centre in a nucleated fashion along the slopes of the bowl valley  except for fast linear development along the A390 to the west  towards Threemilestone  As Truro has grown  it has incorporated a number of previous settlements as suburbs or unofficial districts  These include Kenwyn and Moresk to the north  Trelander to the east  Newham to the south  and Highertown  Treliske and Gloweth to the west   4  Demographics and economy  Truro s popularity within Cornwall as the number one destination for retail and leisure  and its role as the administrative centre of the county  is unusual compared to other cities in the country given that it is the fourth most populous settlement in Cornwall  Furthermore  population growth has been slow compared to other Cornish towns and Cornwall as a whole  at 10 5% during the 1971–1998 period   There are approximately 22 000 jobs available in Truro  major employers in the city include the Royal Cornwall Hospital  Cornwall Council  and Truro College  The number of jobs is more than twice the number of economically active people living in the city  at 9 500  This results in a large amount of commuting which is a major factor in the traffic congestion problems from which the city suffers  Earnings on average are higher than the rest of Cornwall   Housing prices in Truro are at an all time high  also being 8% more expensive than the rest of Cornwall  Truro was named in 2006 as the top small city in the United Kingdom for increasing house prices  at 262% since 1996  There is a large demand for new housing in the city  and a call for inner city properties to be converted into flats or houses to encourage city centre living and to alleviate the dependence on cars   5  Culture  5 1  Attractions  Truro s most recognisable feature is its Gothic revival Cathedral  designed by architect John Loughborough Pearson and rising above the city at its highest spire
