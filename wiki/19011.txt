The Miocene  symbol MI  is the first geological epoch of the Neogene period and extends from about  Ma   The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell  Its name comes from the Greek words    “less”  and    “new”  and means  less recent  because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene  The Miocene follows the Oligocene epoch and is followed by the Pliocene epoch   The earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene as it cooled into a series of ice ages  The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regional boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene   The apes arose and diversified during the Miocene epoch  becoming widespread in the Old World  In fact  by the end of this epoch  the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees to follow their own evolutionary path  As in the Oligocene before it  grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent  In the Miocene seas  kelp forests made their first appearance and soon became one of Earth s most productive ecosystems  The plants and animals of the Miocene were fairly modern  Mammals and birds were well established  Whales  seals  and kelp spread  The Miocene epoch is of particular interest to geologists and palaeoclimatologists as major phases of Himalayan uplift had occurred during the Miocene epoch affecting monsoonal patterns in Asia  which were interlinked with glaciations in the northern hemisphere   1  Subdivisions  The Miocene faunal stages from youngest to oldest are typically named according to the International Commission on Stratigraphy   These subdivisions within the Miocene are defined by the relative abundance of different species of calcareous nanofossils  calcite platelets shed by brown single celled algae  and foraminifera  single celled protists with diagnostic shells   Two subdivisions each form the Early  Middle and Late Miocene  Regionally  other systems are used  These ages often extend across the ICS epoch boundary into the Pliocene and Oligocene   2  Paleogeography  Continents continued to drift toward their present positions  Of the modern geologic features  only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent  although South America was approaching the western subduction zone in the Pacific Ocean  causing both the rise of the Andes and a southward extension of the Meso American peninsula   Mountain building took place in western North America  Europe  and East Asia  Both continental and marine Miocene deposits are common worldwide with marine outcrops common near modern shorelines  Well studied continental exposures occur in the North American Great Plains and in Argentina   India continued to collide with Asia  creating dramatic new mountain ranges  The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish–Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma  The subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea  known as the Messinian salinity crisis  near the end of the Miocene   The global trend was towards increasing aridity caused primarily by global cooling reducing the ability of the atmosphere to absorb moisture  Uplift of East Africa in the late Miocene was partly responsible for the shrinking of tropical rain forests in that region  and Australia got drier as it entered a zone of low rainfall in the Late Miocene   3  Climate  Climates remained moderately warm  although the slow global cooling that eventually led to the Pleistocene glaciations continued   Although a long term cooling trend was well underway  there is evidence of a warm period during the Miocene when the global climate rivalled that of the Oligocene  The Miocene warming began 21 million years ago and continued until 14 million years ago  when global temperatures took a sharp drop   the Middle Miocene Climate Transition  MMCT   By 8 million years ago  temperatures dropped sharply once again  and the Antarctic ice sheet was already approaching its present day size and thickness  Greenland may have begun to have large glaciers as early as 7 to 8 million years ago  although the climate for the most part remained warm enough to support forests there well into the Pliocene   4  Life  Life during the Miocene Epoch was mostly supported by the two newly formed biomes  kelp forests and grasslands  This allows for more grazers  such as horses  rhinoceroses and hippos  Ninety five percent of modern plants existed by the end of this epoch   4 1  Flora  The coevolution of gritty  fibrous  fire tolerant grasses and long legged gregarious ungulates with high crowned teeth  led to a major expansion of grass grazer ecosystems  with roaming herds of large  swift grazers pursued by predators across broad sweeps of open grasslands  displacing desert  woodland  and browsers  The higher organic content and water retention of the deeper and richer grassland soils  with long term burial of carbon in sediments  produced a carbon and water vapor sink  This  combined with higher surface albedo and lower evapotranspiration of grassland  contributed to a cooler  drier climate  C4 grasses  which are able to assimilate carbon dioxide and water more efficiently than C3 grasses  expanded to become ecologically significant near the end of the Miocene between 6 and 7 million years ago  The expansion of grasslands and radiations among terrestrial herbivores correlates to fluctuations in CO2   Cycads between 11 5 and 5 m y a  began to rediversify after previous declines in variety due to climatic changes  and thus modern cycads are not a good model for a  living fossil    4 2  Fauna  Both marine and continental fauna were fairly modern  although marine mammals were less numerous  Only in isolated South America and Australia did widely divergent fauna exist   In the Early Miocene  several Oligocene groups were still diverse  including nimravids  entelodonts  and three toed horses  Like in the previous Oligocene epoch  oreodonts were still diverse  only to disappear in the earliest Pliocene  During the later Miocene mammals were more modern  with easily recognizable dogs  bears  raccoons  horses  beaver  deer  camels  and whales  along with now extinct groups like borophagine dogs  gomphotheres  three toed horses  and semi aquatic and hornless rhinos like Teleoceras and Aphelops  Islands began to form between South and North America in the Late Miocene  allowing ground sloths like Thinobadistes to island hop to North America  The expansion of silica rich C4 grasses led to worldwide extinctions of herbivorous species without high crowned teeth   Unequivocally recognizable dabbling ducks  plovers  typical owls  cockatoos and crows appear during the Miocene  By the epoch s end  all or almost all modern bird families are believed to have been present  the few post Miocene bird fossils which cannot be placed in the evolutionary tree with full confidence are simply too badly preserved  rather than too equivocal in character  Marine birds reached their highest diversity ever in the course of this epoch   Approximately 100 species of apes lived during this time  ranging throughout Africa  Asia and Europe and varying widely in size  diet  and anatomy  Due to scanty fossil evidence it is unclear which ape or apes contributed to the modern hominid clade  but molecular evidence indicates this ape lived between 7 and 8 million years ago  The first hominins  bipedal apes of the human lineage  appeared in Africa at the very end of the Miocene  including Sahelanthropus  Orrorin  and an early form of Ardipithecus  A  kadabba    In the oceans  brown algae  called kelp  proliferated  supporting new species of sea life  including otters  fish and various invertebrates   Cetaceans attained their greatest diversity during the Miocene  with over 20 recognized genera in comparison to only six living genera  This diversification correlates with emergence of gigantic macro predators such as megatoothed sharks and raptorial sperm whales  Prominent examples are C  megalodon and L  melvillei  Other notable large sharks were C  chubutensis  Isurus hastalis  and Hemipristis serra   Crocodilians also showed signs of diversification during Miocene  The largest form among them was a gigantic caiman Purussaurus which inhabited South America  Another gigantic form was a false gharial Rhamphosuchus  which inhabited modern age India  A strange form Mourasuchus also thrived alongside Purussaurus  This species developed a specialized filter feeding mechanism  and it likely preyed upon small fauna despite its gigantic size   The pinnipeds  which appeared near the end of the Oligocene  became more aquatic  Prominent genus was Allodesmus  A ferocious walrus  Pelagiarctos may have preyed upon other species of pinnipeds including Allodesmus   Furthermore  South American waters witnessed the arrival of Megapiranha paranensis  which were considerably larger than modern age piranhas   5  Oceans  There is evidence from oxygen isotopes at Deep Sea Drilling Program sites that ice began to build up in Antarctica about 36 Ma during the Eocene  Further marked decreases in temperature during the Middle Miocene at 15 Ma probably reflect increased ice growth in Antarctica  It can therefore be assumed that East Antarctica had some glaciers during the early to mid Miocene  23–15 Ma   Oceans cooled partly due to the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current  and about 15 million years ago the ice cap in the southern hemisphere started to grow to its present form  The Greenland ice cap developed later  in the Middle Pliocene time  about 3 million years ago   6  Middle Miocene disruption  The  Middle Miocene disruption  refers to a wave of extinctions of terrestrial and aquatic life forms that occurred following the Miocene Climatic Optimum  18 to 16 Ma   around 14 8 to 14 5 million years ago  during the Langhian stage of the mid Miocene  A major and permanent cooling step occurred between 14 8 and 14 1 Ma  associated with increased production of cold Antarctic deep waters and a major growth of the East Antarctic ice sheet  A Middle Miocene δ18O increase  that is  a relative increase in the heavier isotope of oxygen  has been noted in the Pacific  the Southern Ocean and the South Atlantic   7  See also  Astaracian  Turolian  Vallesian
