The history of North Korea began with the partition of Korea at the end of World War II in 1945  and the creation of the Communist aligned Democratic People s Republic of Korea  DPRK  headed by the former guerrilla leader  Kim Il sung  In 1950 the Korean War broke out  After much destruction  the war ended with the status quo being restored  The DPRK had failed to unify Korea under its leadership  the US led United Nations force had failed to conquer North Korea  The peninsula was divided by the Korean Demilitarized Zone  and a US military force remained in South Korea  Tension between the two sides continued  Kim Il sung remained in power until his death in 1994  He developed a pervasive personality cult and steered the country on an independent course in accordance with the Juche idea  However  with natural disasters and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in 1991  North Korea went into a severe economic crisis  Kim Il sung s son  Kim Jong il succeeded him  and was in turn succeeded by his son  Kim Jong un  Amid international alarm  North Korea developed nuclear missiles   1  Division of Korea  North Korea s history began with occupation of the Korean Peninsula north of the 38th parallel by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II in 1945  a division of Korea with the United States occupying the south  The Democratic People s Republic of Korea was established in 1948   In the aftermath of partition of Korea  Kim Il sung arrived in North Korea on August 22 after 26 years in exile in China and the Soviet Union  In September 1945  Kim was installed by the Soviets as head of the Provisional People’s Committee  He was not  at this time  the head of the Communist Party  whose headquarters were in Seoul in the U S  occupied south   Kim established the Korean People s Army  KPA  aligned with the Communists  formed from a cadre of guerrillas and former soldiers who had gained combat experience in battles against the Japanese and later Nationalist Chinese troops  From their ranks  using Soviet advisers and equipment  Kim constructed a large army skilled in infiltration tactics and guerrilla warfare  Before the outbreak of the Korean War  Joseph Stalin equipped the KPA with modern medium tanks  trucks  artillery  and small arms  Kim also formed an air force  equipped at first with ex Soviet propeller driven fighter and attack aircraft  Later  North Korean pilot candidates were sent to the Soviet Union and China to train in MiG 15 jet aircraft at secret bases   Although original plans called for all Korean elections sponsored by the United Nations in 1948  Kim persuaded the Soviets not to allow the UN north of the 38th parallel  As a result  a month after the South was granted independence as the Republic of Korea  the Democratic People s Republic of Korea  DPRK  was proclaimed on September 9  with Kim as premier  On October 12  the Soviet Union declared that Kim s regime was the only lawful government on the peninsula  The Communist Party merged with the New People s Party to form the Workers Party of North Korea  of which Kim was vice chairman   In 1949  the Workers Party of North Korea merged with its southern counterpart to become the Workers Party of Korea  WPK  with Kim as party chairman   By 1949  North Korea was a full fledged Communist state  All parties and mass organizations joined the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland  ostensibly a popular front but in reality dominated by the Communists  The government moved rapidly to establish a political system that was partly styled on the Soviet system  with political power monopolised by the Worker s Party of Korea  WPK   The establishment of a command economy followed  Most of the country s productive assets had been owned by the Japanese or by Koreans who had been collaborators  The nationalization of these assets in 1946 placed 70% of industry under state control  By 1949 this percentage had risen to 90%  Since then  virtually all manufacturing  finance and internal and external trade has been conducted by the state   In agriculture  the government moved more slowly towards a command economy  The  land to the tiller  reform of 1946 redistributed the bulk of agricultural land to the poor and landless peasant population  effectively breaking the power of the landed class  In 1954  however  a partial collectivization was carried out  with peasants being urged  and often forced  into agricultural co operatives  By 1958  virtually all farming was being carried out collectively  and the co operatives were increasingly merged into larger productive units   Although developmental debates took place within the Workers  Party of Korea in the 1950s  North Korea  like all the postwar communist states  undertook massive state investment in heavy industry  state infrastructure and military strength  neglecting the production of consumer goods  By paying the collectivized peasants low state controlled prices for their product  and using the surplus thus extracted to pay for industrial development  the state carried out a series of three year plans  which brought industry s share of the economy from 47% in 1946 to 70% in 1959  despite the devastation of the Korean War  There were huge increases in electricity production  steel production and machine building  The large output of tractors and other agricultural machinery achieved a great increase in agricultural productivity   2  The Korean War  1950 1953   The consolidation of Syngman Rhee s government in the South with American military support and the suppression of the October 1948 insurrection ended North Korean hopes that a Stalinist revolution in the South could reunify Korea  and from early 1949 Kim Il sung sought Soviet and Chinese support for a military campaign to reunify the country by force  The withdrawal of most U S  forces from South Korea in June 1949 left the southern government defended only by a weak and inexperienced South Korean army  The southern régime also had to deal with a citizenry of uncertain loyalty  The North Korean army  by contrast  had benefited from the Soviet Union s WWII era equipment  and had a core of hardened veterans who had fought either as anti Japanese guerrillas or alongside the Chinese Communists   Initially Joseph Stalin rejected Kim Il sung s requests for permission to invade the South  but in late 1949 the Communist victory in China and the development of Soviet nuclear weapons made him re consider Kim s proposal  In January 1950  after China s Mao Zedong indicated that the People s Republic of China would send troops and other support to Kim  Stalin approved an invasion  The Soviets provided limited support in the form of advisors who helped the North Koreans as they planned the operation  and Soviet military instructors to train some of the Korean units  However  from the very beginning Stalin made it clear that the Soviet Union would avoid a direct confrontation with the U S  over Korea and would not commit ground forces even in case of major military crisis  The stage was set for a civil war between two rival régimes on the Korean peninsula   For over a year before North Korean forces attacked the southern zone on June 25  1950  the two sides had engaged in a series of bloody clashes along the 38th parallel  especially in the Ongjin area on the west coast  On June 25  1950  the northern forces escalated the battles into a full fledged offensive and crossed the parallel in large numbers  Due to a combination of surprise  superior military forces  and a poorly armed South Korean army  the Northern forces quickly captured Seoul  forcing Syngman Rhee and his government to flee further south  By mid July North Korean troops had overwhelmed the South Korean and allied American units defending South Korea and forced them back to a defensive perimeter in south east South Korea known as the Pusan Perimeter  However  the North Koreans failed to unify the peninsula when foreign troops entered the civil war  North Korean forces were defeated by September and driven northwards by United Nations forces under the command of General Douglas MacArthur  By October  the U N  forces had retaken Seoul and captured Pyongyang  and it became Kim s turn to flee  But in late November Chinese forces entered the war and pushed the U N  forces back  retaking Pyongyang in December 1950 and Seoul in January 1951  However  U N  forces managed to retake Seoul for the South Koreans  The war essentially became a bloody stalemate for the next two years   3  Postwar  The whole of the Korean peninsula lay in ruins when the armistice was signed at Pammunjon on July 27  1953  Despite the failure of his attempt at unifying the nation under his rule  Kim Il sung considered the war a victory in the sense that he remained in power  As a result  the North Korean media made the most of it by focusing entirely on the defeats suffered by the US and UN forces during the failed invasion of North Korea in late 1950  The armistice was celebrated in Pyongyang with a military parade in which Kim declared   Despite their best efforts  the imperialist invaders were defeated with great loss in men and material    Reconstruction of the DPRK proceeded with extensive Chinese and Soviet assistance  a task that took the next few years  Meanwhile  Kim began gradually consolidating his power  Up to this time  North Korean politics were represented by four factions  the Yan an faction made up of returnees from China  the Soviet Koreans  native Korean communists  and Kim s own group  those who had fought guerrilla actions against Japan in the 1930s and 1940s   Pak Hon yong  party vice chairman and Foreign Minister of the DPRK  was blamed for the failure of the southern population to support North Korea during the war  was dismissed from his positions in 1953  and was executed after a show trial in 1955  Most of the South Korean leftists and communist sympathizers who defected to the North in 1945–1953 were also accused of espionage and other crimes  and subsequently killed  imprisoned  or exiled to remote agricultural and mining villages  Potential rivals from other groups such as Kim Tu bong were also purged   In 1956  Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made a sweeping denunciation of Stalin  which sent shock waves throughout the communist world  North Korea  Albania  and China were among the loudest opponents of de Stalinization  In addition  there was disagreement over Kim s decision to follow a rigid Stalinist model of economic development which promoted heavy industry and energy over light industry and consumer goods  While Kim Il sung was visiting Moscow to personally meet with Khrushchev that June  a group of his opponents tried to seize control of the government in Pyongyang  They denounced Kim as a tyrant who practiced arbitrary  one man rule  When he hastily returned home  the brief attempt at political liberalization in North Korea was ended  Moreover  General O Chin u dispatched troops to the streets of Pyongyang to prevent any protests in favor of reform from breaking out  Kim and his guerrilla faction had the advantage of appearing as national heroes due to their resistance against the Japanese and there was no question about their patriotism  By contrast  the Yan an and Soviet Korean groups tended to appear as the representatives of other nations  A series of purges followed in 1956 1958  and by 1961 the last remaining opposition to Kim had disappeared   Kim Il sung had initially been criticized by the Soviets during a previous 1955 visit to Moscow for practicing Stalinism and a cult of personality  which was already growing enormous  The Korean ambassador to the USSR  Li Sangjo  a member of the Yan an faction  reported that it had become a criminal offense to so much as write on Kim s picture in a newspaper and that he had been elevated to the status of Marx  Lenin  Mao  and Stalin in the communist pantheon  He also charged Kim with rewriting history to appear as if his guerrilla faction had single handedly liberated Korea from the Japanese  completely ignoring the assistance of the Chinese Communist Party  In addition  Li stated that in the process of agricultural collectivization  grain was being forcibly confiscated from the peasants  leading to  at least 300 suicides  and that Kim made nearly all major policy decisions and appointments himself  Li reported that over 30 000 people were in prison for completely unjust and arbitrary reasons as trivial as not printing Kim Il sung s portrait on sufficient quality paper or using newspapers with his picture to wrap parcels  Grain confiscation and tax collection were also conducted forcibly with violence  beatings  and imprisonment  During Kim Il sung s Moscow visit  the Soviets recommended that he discard the personality cult  adhere to the ideas of collective leadership  remove falsified history accounts from textbooks  and work towards improving the living standards of the Korean people  which remained poor and below prewar standards  Foodstuffs during the initial postwar period were rationed and extremely expensive  as were consumer items  By comparison  South Korea  which had less of an industrial base than the DPRK  had a better food supply and was also flooded with American goods although it should be noted that the overall destruction there during the war was smaller   Relations with China also became acerbic in part due to the continued presence of PLA troops in North Korea following the 1953 armistice  The aftermath of the failed 1956 coup brought about a more nationalistic mood in Pyongyang and the occupation forces increasingly came to be seen as exactly that  While visiting Moscow in November 1957 for the 40th anniversary of the 1917 Revolution  Kim Il Sung was again told by both Soviet leaders and Mao Zedong to adhere to collective leadership and not publish falsified history texts  An irate Kim responded by protesting the Chinese military presence in the DPRK  so Mao finally agreed to a troop withdrawal  The following February  the last Chinese forces departed from the country  Aside from that  the leadership in Beijing was nearly as unenthusiastic about Kim Il sung as the Soviets  with Mao Zedong criticizing him for having started the whole  idiotic war  and for being an incompetent military commander who should have been removed from power  PLA commander Peng Dehuai was equally contemptuous of Kim s skills at waging war   In the end however  Kim Il sung remained in power partially because the Soviets turned their attention to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 that fall  The Soviets and Chinese were unable to stop the inevitable purge of Kim s domestic opponents or his move towards a one man Stalinist autocracy and relations with both countries deteriorated in the former s case because of the elimination of the pro Soviet Koreans and the latter because of the regime s refusal to acknowledge Chinese assistance in either liberation from the Japanese or the war in 1950 53   Stalin continued to be honored in North Korea long after his death in 1953  and a street in Pyongyang bore his name until 1980  By contrast  neighboring Chinese leader Mao Zedong was mostly ignored and Kim Il sung rejected most of his policies such as the Hundred Flowers Campaign and  later  the Cultural Revolution  However  the Great Leap Forward led to a Korean imitation in 1958 1960 known as the Chollima  Flying Horse  Campaign  Still  Kim himself remained the primary object of veneration in the DPRK  He had always had a personality cult from 1949 onward  and by the 1970s it would reach unprecedented dimensions   The gradual rift between China and the USSR that developed in the early 1960s caused North Korea to pursue a delicate balancing act between the two communist giants  By 1963  this balance clearly tipped towards Beijing  North Korea joined the Chinese in criticizing Khrushchev for  revisionism  and for being too soft on the United States  Official proclamations stated that the DPRK and PRC were in  complete agreement  on all major issues  Racial  cultural  and historical ties also pulled North Korea closer to China  However  Kim Il sung eventually decided that he was moving too far towards becoming a Chinese satellite  China was also comparatively un industrialized and could not provide the technical and military assistance Pyongyang sought  Finally  the PRC exploded its first atomic bomb in October 1964 and subsequently refused to give  or even sell  North Korea any nuclear weapons of its own  apparently fearing that Kim was too likely to use them in his quest to reunify the peninsula  In 1965  the pro Chinese stance of North Korea had noticeably diminished   Stalin had viewed the DPRK as a strategic asset for the Soviet Union so that it would have access to warm water ports and possibly a springboard in the event Japan would engage in renewed aggression in the future  However  its value declined after his death when Khrushchev began emphasizing nuclear power over conventional warfare and also normalized relations with Tokyo in 1956  Also Khrushchev s primary interest in Asia was relations with China  to the point where he viewed North Korea  North Vietnam  and Mongolia as unimportant  In addition  he saw the charismatic leaders of the Cuban revolution as far more appealing allies than Kim Il sung s secretive Stalinist regime   While Kim Il sung could not afford to alienate Moscow too much  he did nonetheless chafe under theirs and Beijing s thumb  He became agitated when the Chinese and Soviets forced him to reinstate some of his enemies into the Politburo following the August 1956 coup attempt  although as mentioned above  he did end up purging them in the next three years   The Sino Soviet split proved an asset to North Korea since it allowed Kim a freer domestic hand  He also rejected North Korean participation in COMECON so as to not end up a Soviet economic colony  Trying to maintain favorable relations with Moscow  Pyongyang referred to the Soviet reaction to the Cuban Missile Crisis as  a wise decision for the sake of world peace  while by comparison  the Chinese accused Khrushchev of cowardice in the face of imperialism   However  North Korea ended up falling out with the Soviet Union when they flatly rejected a shopping list that was sent to them by Kim Il sung including requests for SAM missiles  Mig 21 fighter jets  and submarines  Following the DPRK s shift to a pro Chinese stance in 1963  Moscow dismissed them as the PRC s puppet and that Kim s juche philosophy was a cover for obedience to Beijing  Kim told Alexei Kosygin in 1965 that he was not anyone s puppet and  We implement the purest Marxism and condemn both the mistakes of the CPC and the CPSU    Despite this  it was obvious that North Korea had more in common with China than the Soviet Union  including the above mentioned racial  cultural  and historical connections  Kim Il sung joined with Mao Zedong in supporting a hardline anti US stance and in rejecting Khrushchev s de Stalinization and criticism of personality cults  in addition to a dislike for COMECON and other attempts to promote economic integration among the communist bloc   China however had been the imperial overlord of Korea in past centuries and Kim became concerned that that this kind of relationship would return  thus he decided to avoid moving too far into Beijing s arms  Also Kim Il sung was eager to promote his own leadership in the Third World independent of the Chinese and Soviets  The fall of Khrushchev from power in 1964 proved advantageous to North Korea as it allowed them to pull away from Chinese dominance  Much like Stalin  Khrushchev maintained direct  personal control of Soviet foreign policy and the new leadership of Brezhnev and Kosygin were virtual neophytes who knew little about world affairs except in simple ideological terms of  socialist world good    capitalist world bad   Kim Il sung thus easily convinced them to supply 150 million rubles worth of military assistance  50% greater than his 1962 demands in exchange for which Brezhnev and Kosygin promised to purchase North Korean products even though the Soviet Union had no use for them and as Kim even admitted  were  too poor quality to sell abroad   North Korea also requested Soviet aid in several economic ventures  all of which the new leadership in Moscow readily agreed to despite their skepticism over Kim s domestic and foreign policies  as they believed it to be their duty to a fraternal socialist state and to keep Pyongyang out of the Chinese orbit  In this sense  Moscow could feel quite satisfied at North Korea s divorce from China after 1964 and Kim Il sung s condemnation of the Cultural Revolution as  insanity   It was of course inevitable that Kim did not want to become a Soviet puppet any more than he wanted to become a Chinese puppet and so he hurried to restore ties with Beijing as soon as the chaos of the Cultural Revolution subsided   Meanwhile  the peninsula remained divided and relations with the ROK and the United States were bitterly hostile  But when the US became engaged in Vietnam around this time  Kim saw an opportunity  Inspired by the actions of the Vietcong  he began employing his own guerrilla squads to infiltrate South Korea  spread propaganda  and commit sabotage  North Korean agents came south in 1966 1969  creating disruption  but ultimately failing to win over the South Korean populace  Actions such as an attempted assassination of ROK president Park Chung hee in Seoul failed  and Kim publicly disclaimed any responsibility for them  North Korean fighter pilots were also sent to Hanoi s assistance  and conversely South Korea sent a contingent of troops to aid the government in Saigon    Relations with China collapsed when that country became engulfed in the Cultural Revolution  North Korea refused to condemn the campaign  stating that it was Beijing s internal affair  However  when visiting Moscow in 1966  Kim expressed to the new Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev his bewilderment at the Cultural Revolution in China  The Red Guards then denounced Kim as a  millionaire  a revisionist  and a capitalist  who lived in splendor and luxury while American imperialists made war on Vietnam  all the while ignoring Pyongyang s secret assistance to the DRV   In the end  North Korea could not condemn a neighbor that was easily capable of putting a million troops on its border poised to invade  and had no choice but to lie low until the Cultural Revolution ended  There were isolated clashes with Chinese troops along the border in 1968 as Chinese and North Korean troops exchanged small arms fire with each other  As a result  the Red Guards erected loudspeakers on the border facing North Korea where they denounced Kim Il sung and read quotations from Mao s Little Red Book  North Korean troops responded by erecting their own loudspeakers towards the Chinese border and airing quotations from their leader s writings  But by 1970  most of the storm clouds of the Cultural Revolution had blown away and relations with China quickly returned to normal  Chinese premier Zhou Enlai visited Pyongyang that year and apologized for the attacks made on Kim by the Red Guards  At the same time  the Soviets were again criticized by both Chinese and North Korean officials for being too soft on the United States  The Cultural Revolution was now viewed in North Korea as an excellent idea and  completely correct    The year of 1968 was mainly dominated by the capture of the USS Pueblo  AGER 2   a reconnaissance ship intercepted in the Sea of Japan that January  The crew were held captive throughout the year despite American protests that the vessel was in international waters and finally released in December after a formal US apology was issued  North Korea went in for a repeat performance in April 1969 by shooting down an EC 121 aircraft  killing everyone on board  The Nixon administration found itself unable to react at all  since the US was heavily committed in Vietnam and had no troops to spare if the situation in Korea escalated  However  the Pueblo capture and EC 121 shootdown did not find approval in Moscow  as the Soviet Union did not want a second major war to erupt in Asia  China s response to the USS Pueblo crisis is less clear   In 1972  the first formal summit meeting between Pyongyang and Seoul was held  but cautious talks did not lead much of anywhere and relations between the two Koreas continued down the path of hostility   North Korea s official reaction to the visit of President Richard Nixon to China in February 1972 was one of celebration on the grounds that the US could not diplomatically isolate China and had been forced to finally negotiate  Privately though  Kim Il sung was worried about this development and paid a visit to Beijing a few months later in which Mao Zedong told him that China merely wished to acquire technology from the US and was not attempting to sell out to capitalism   With the fall of South Vietnam to the North Vietnamese on April 30  1975  Kim Il sung began to feel that the US had shown its weakness and that reunification of Korea under his regime was finally possible  Kim visited Beijing in May 1975 in the hope of gaining political and military support for this plan to invade South Korea again  but Mao Zedong refused  Despite public proclamations of support  Mao privately told Kim that China would be unable to assist North Korea this time because of the lingering after effects of the Cultural Revolution throughout China  and also because Mao had recently decided to restore diplomatic relations with the US  Afterwards  Kim went home empty handed   Relations with China remained on an even course after Mao s death on September 9  1976  China s new leaders  Hua Guofeng and Deng Xiaoping  both visited North Korea in 1978  although they failed to reach a common understanding on relations with the Soviet Union  Beijing was not on friendly terms with Moscow during the 1970s  while Pyongyang continued its usual balancing act with both the Soviet Union and China   The Chinese establishment of formal diplomatic ties with the US in early 1979 was welcomed in Pyongyang and official proclamations congratulated  our brotherly neighbor for ending long hostile relations and establishing diplomatic ties with the US    4  Economic decline  Due to a series of ill fortuned policy decisions concerning military expenditures and mining industries and the radical changes in international oil prices by the late 1970s  the North Korean economy began to slow down  These decisions eventually affected the whole economy  forcing the nation to acquire external debts  At the same time North Korea s policy of self reliance and the antagonism of America and its allies made it difficult for them to expand foreign trade or secure credit   In the 1970s  expansion of North Korea s economy  with the accompanying rise in living standards  came to an end and a few decades later went into reverse  Compounding this was a decision to borrow foreign capital and invest heavily in military industries  North Korea s desire to lessen its dependence on aid from China and the Soviet Union prompted the expansion of its military power  which had begun in the second half of the 1960s  The government believed such expenditures could be covered by foreign borrowing and increased sales of its mineral wealth in the international market  North Korea invested heavily in its mining industries and purchased a large quantity of mineral extraction infrastructure from abroad  However  soon after making such investments  international prices for many of North Korea s native minerals fell  leaving the country with large debts and an inability to pay them off and still provide a high level of social welfare to its people   Worsening this already poor situation  the centrally planned economy  which emphasized heavy industry had reached the limits of its productive potential in North Korea  Juche repeated demands that North Koreans learn to build and innovate domestically had run its course as had the ability of North Koreans to keep technological pace with other industrialized nations  By the mid to late 1970s some parts of the capitalist world  including South Korea  were creating new industries based around computers  electronics  and other advanced technology in contrast to North Korea s Stalinist economy of mining and steel production   Continuing a  self reliance  ideology that had once been highly successful  Kim Il Sung was unable to respond effectively to the challenge of an increasingly prosperous and well armed South Korea  which undermined the legitimacy of his own regime  Having failed at their earlier attempt to conduct market economy reforms such as those carried out in China by Deng Xiaoping  Kim opted for continued ideological purity  The DPRK by 1980 was faced with the choice of either repaying its international loans  or continuing its support of social welfare for its people  Given the ideals of Juche  North Korea chose to default on its loans and by the late 1980s its industrial output was declining  A 1984 visit to Pyongyang by CCP General Secretary Hu Yaobang was received politely  but failed to sell Kim on making any economic reforms  The previous year  Kim Jong il had visited China on his first official trip abroad since being named his father s successor  The Chinese took him to see the Special Economic Zone in Guangdong Province  but an unimpressed Kim referred to the leadership in Beijing as  revisionists   Overall  North Korea during the 1980s became gradually more isolated from the rest of the communist bloc and the world in general  Tensions with the US and South Korea worsened due to President Ronald Reagan s strong anti communist stance and more assertive foreign policy  and the number of American troops on the peninsula increased  During this period  North Korea began to acquire a reputation as a terrorist state thanks to events such as the planting of a bomb on a South Korean airliner in Burma during 1983 and kidnappings of Japanese and other foreign nationals   That same year in 1984  North Korea again drifted towards the Soviet Union after Kim visited Moscow during a grand tour of the USSR  his first trip to Moscow since 1966  where he met Konstantin Chernenko  his first and only meeting with this Soviet leader   Kim also made public visits to East Germany  Czechoslovakia  Poland  Hungary  Romania  Bulgaria and Yugoslavia  However  DPRK USSR relations ran out of gas by 1986  The basic nature of Pyongyang s political system was very different from Moscow s  The Korean Workers Party still existed  but it was essentially ceremonial and had long since been subordinated to Kim s personal dictatorship  Moreover  his Juche philosophy had effectively replaced Marxism–Leninism as North Korea s official ideology  as outlined in the 1974 North Korean constitution   In addition  the personality cult of Kim had assumed proportions not seen anywhere else in the world  Most of this  as well as the Juche philosophy  was the work of his son Kim Jong Il  who had been officially nominated as his father s successor in October 1980   The elder Kim was unmoved by the social and economic reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev starting in 1985  and this contributed to the decline in relations with Moscow  Chinese economic reforms also had little effect in North Korea  as did the fall of communist states in Eastern Europe during 1989  The leadership in Pyongyang responded by proclaiming that this event demonstrated the correctness of juche on the grounds that Marxism–Leninism was an outdated idea and the failure of the Eastern European states to evolve from Marxism to juche ensured the return of capitalism to them  China endured a period of international isolation after the Tiananmen Square Massacre  which caused it to embrace Pyongyang as one of the world s only surviving communist states  Even so  China alienated North Korea when they participated in the 1988 Summer Olympics in South Korea in defiance of the North Korean boycott  Relations with North Korea were further strained in 1990 when the Chinese agreed to recognize both Korean governments equally   The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 deprived North Korea of its main source of economic aid  leaving China as the isolated regime s only major ally  Without Soviet aid  North Korea s economy went into a free fall  By this time in the early 1990s  Kim Jong il was already conducting most of the day to day activities of running of the state  and he apparently kept his aging father in the dark about the growing economic disaster happening throughout the country  Also at this time  North Korea was attracting the ire of the international community for its attempts at developing nuclear weapons  Former US president Jimmy Carter made a visit to Pyongyang in June 1994 in which he met with Kim and returned proclaiming that he had settled the nuclear question   5  Succession by Kim Jong il  Kim Il sung died from a sudden heart attack on July 8  1994  three weeks after the Carter visit  His son  Kim Jong il  who had already assumed key positions in the government  succeeded as General Secretary of the Korean Workers  Party  At that time  North Korea had no secretary general in the party nor a president  Minimal legal procedure that had been established was summarily ignored  Although a new constitution appeared to end the war time political system  it did not completely terminate the transitional military rule  Rather it legitimized and institutionalized military rule by making the National Defense Commission  NDC  the most important state organ and its chairman the highest authority  After three years of consolidating his power  Kim Jong il became Chairman of the NDC on October 8  1997  a position described by the NDC as the nation s  highest administrative authority   and thus North Korea s de facto head of state  His succession had been decided as early as 1980  with the support of the military and party apparatus   The fundamental cause of this decline is that the state  which runs the entire economy  cannot pay for the necessary imports of capital goods to undertake the desperately needed modernization of its industrial plants  The inefficiency of North Korea s Stalinist style agricultural system also contributed to the disaster  In addition  North Korea spends about a quarter of its GDP on armaments  including the development of nuclear weapons  and establishes a military draft where it keeps nearly all able bodied males aged 18–30 in uniform  while the basic infrastructure of the state is allowed to crumble   Amid these growing problems  Kim Jong il began reworking the DPRK s political system to accommodate his own style of governing  With the Cold War a thing of the past  the Korean Workers  Party  which was already largely powerless  was made even more ornamental  Instead  Kim adopted a new ideology known as  Songun   Translated as  Army First   it effectively transformed North Korea into a military dictatorship rather than a traditional communist state  The Korean Peoples Army would dictate policy from now on   During the 2000s  Kim Jong il made no serious effort to revive the Stalinist economic system his father had spent years building  During that time  several factories and mines all over the country were shuttered and abandoned  There was little functioning industry except that related to defense and tourism  Although the personality cult of the two Kims remained  as did the promotion of Juche  in effect North Korea by the start of 21st century had become a markedly different nation than it had been during the Cold War  Also  while still very much a totalitarian state  the DPRK had become somewhat less rigid than in Kim Il sung s day  Strict labor discipline broke down with the economy  and people were no longer required to attend mandatory lectures on Juche  The country also achieved a cult following among international tourists  because there was nowhere else in the world like a closed off and bizarre society and culture like North Korea  By comparison  during the Cold War  there were rarely any foreign visitors to the DPRK except from other communist nations  Although China remained as Pyongyang s main ally  the two communist countries no longer bore much resemblance to each other or to their own past in terms of appearance  the economy  and each other s society   As a result  North Korea is now dependent on international food aid to feed its population  According to Amnesty International  more than 13 million people  over half the population of the country  suffered from malnutrition in the DPRK in 2003  In 2001 the DPRK received nearly $300 million USD in food aid from the U S   South Korea  Japan  and the European Union  plus much additional aid from the United Nations and non governmental organizations  Unspecified  but apparently large  amounts of aid in the form of food  oil and coal are also provided by China every year  Despite this  North Korea maintained its hostile rhetoric against the U S   South Korea and Japan  The supply of heating and electricity outside the capital is practically non existent  and food and medical supplies are scarce  When there is a bad harvest  as has been persistently the case over recent years  the population faces actual famine  a situation never before seen in a peacetime industrial economy  Since 1997 there has been a steady stream of illegal emigration to China  despite the efforts of both countries to prevent it  Illegal North Koreans caught in China were often deported back to North Korea where most of them were tortured  killed  or sent to a reeducation camp  Those who weren t caught were often forced into slave labor or prostitution anywhere in China   Kim Jong il said that the solution to this crisis is earning hard currency  developing information technology  and attracting foreign aid  but very little progress has been made in these areas  So far the DPRK  not surprisingly given Juche and UN attempts to isolate them  has made little progress in attracting foreign capital   In July 2002 some limited reforms were announced  The currency was devalued and food prices were allowed to rise in the hope of stimulating agricultural production  It was announced that food rationing systems as well as subsidized housing would be phased out  A  family unit farming system  was introduced on a trial basis for the first time since collectivization in 1954  The government also set up a  special administrative zone  in Sinuiju  a town near the border with China  The local authority was given near autonomy  especially in its economic affairs  This was an attempt to emulate the success of such free trade zones in China  but it attracted little outside interest  Despite some optimistic talk in the foreign press the impetus of these reforms has not been followed with  for example  a large scale decollectivization such as occurred in China under Deng   6  Current situation  President Kim Dae jung of South Korea actively attempted to reduce tensions between the two Koreas under the Sunshine Policy  but this produced few immediate results  Since the election of George W  Bush as the President of the United States  North Korea has faced renewed external pressure over its nuclear program  reducing the prospect of international economic assistance   North Korea remains a totalitarian Stalinist state  The lack of access to the foreign media and the tradition of secrecy in North Korea means that there is little news about political conditions  but Amnesty International s 2003 report on North Korea says that  there were reports of severe repression of people involved in public and private religious activities  including imprisonment  torture and executions  Unconfirmed reports suggested that torture and ill treatment were widespread in North Korean prisons and labour camps  Conditions were reportedly extremely harsh    There seems little immediate likelihood that North Korea will undergo an East German style transition  a prospect that South Korea and China view with great trepidation because of the fear of a sudden and large exodus of North Korean refugees into their countries  There appears to be little significant internal opposition to the regime  Indeed  a great many of the refugees fleeing to China because of famine still showed significant support for the current government as well as pride in their homeland  Many of these food refugees reportedly return to North Korea after earning sufficient money   In 2002  Kim Jong il declared that  money should be capable of measuring the worth of all commodities   followed by some small market oriented measures  and the creation of the Kaesong Industrial Region with transport links to South Korea was announced  Experiments are under way to allow factory managers to fire underperforming workers and give bonuses  China’s investments increased to $200 million in 2004  China has counseled North Korea’s leaders to gradually open the economy to market forces  and it is possible this path will be successfully followed as well as China s policy of keeping political control firmly in the hands of the Communist Party   China for its part has sought to preserve North Korea as a strategic buffer zone  in part to prevent a mass influx of refugees and also out of the desire to not have a unified  American backed Korea on its border   North Korea declared on February 10  2005 that it has nuclear weapons bringing widespread calls for the North to return to the six party talks aimed at curbing its nuclear program  It was initially disputed by outside sources whether or not North Korea has nuclear weapons  and many Russian sources denied that North Korea has the technology necessary to build a nuclear weapon  On Monday  October 9  2006  North Korea has announced that it had successfully detonated a nuclear device underground at 10 36 am local time without any radiation leak  An official at South Korea s seismic monitoring center confirmed a magnitude 3 6 tremor felt at the time North Korea said it conducted the test was not a natural occurrence   Additionally  North Korea has a very active missile development program  In 1998  North Korea tested a Taepondong 1 Space Launch Vehicle  which successfully launched but failed to reach orbit  On July 5  2006  they tested a Taepodong 2 ICBM that reportedly could reach the west coast of the U S  in the 2 stage version  or the entire U S  with a third stage  However  the missile failed shortly after launch  so it is unknown what its exact capabilities are or how close North Korea is to perfecting the technology   North Korea s advancements in weapons technology appear to give them leverage in ongoing negotiations with the United Nations and other countries  On February 13  2007  North Korea signed an agreement with South Korea  the United States  Russia  China  and Japan  in which North Korea will shut down its Yongbyon nuclear reactor in exchange for economic and energy assistance  However in 2009 the North continued its nuclear test program   Further tensions between the north and south began in 2010 when a South Korean navy ship was sunk  later reports revealed a torpedo from North Korea was the cause   Kim Jong Il died on December 17  2011 and was succeeded by his son  Kim Jong un  Tensions between North Korea and democratic countries have since increased in 2012 and 2013 due to its recent rocket launches and nuclear weapons testing in defiance of international law  and UN sanctions have been tightened   7  See also  History of Asia  History of East Asia  History of Korea  List of leaders of North Korea  Politics of North Korea  Prehistory of Korea  2006 North Korea
