Pope Alexander III  c  1100 1105 – 30 August 1181   born Roland of Siena  was Pope from 7 September 1159 to his death in 1181  He laid the foundation stone for the famous Notre Dame de Paris   1  Early life and career  Pope Alexander III was born in Siena  From 14th century he is referred to as a member of the aristocratic family of Bandinelli  although this has not been proven  For a long time  scholars believed him to be identical with the 12th century canon lawyer and theologian Master Roland of Bologna  who composed the  Stroma  or  Summa Rolandi —one of the earliest commentaries on the Decretum of Gratian—and the  Sententiae Rolandi   a sentence collection displaying the influence of Pierre Abélard   In October 1150  Pope Eugene III created him Cardinal Deacon of Santi Cosma e Damiano  Later he became Cardinal Priest of St Mark  In 1153  he became papal chancellor and was the leader of the cardinals opposed to German Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa  He negotiated the Treaty of Benevento  which restored peaceful relations between Rome and the Kingdom of Sicily   2  Disputed election  On 7 September 1159  he was chosen the successor of Pope Adrian IV  A minority of the cardinals  however  elected the cardinal priest Octavian  who assumed the name of Victor IV and became the German Emperor s antipope  The situation was critical for Alexander III  because according to many chronicles of the time  perhaps exaggerating   Barbarossa s antipope received the approval of most of the kingdoms of Europe  with the exception of the kingdoms of Portugal  Sicily and Spain  However  in 1161  King Géza II of Hungary signed an agreement and recognised Alexander III as the rightful pope and declared that the supreme spiritual leader was the only one who could exercise the rite of investiture  This meant that Alexander s legitimacy was gaining strength  as soon proved by the fact that other monarchs  such as the king of France and King Henry II of England  recognized his authority   However  the dispute between Alexander III  Antipope Victor IV and his successors Antipope Paschal III and Antipope Calixtus III  who had the German imperial support  continued until Frederick Barbarossa s defeat at the Legnano in 1176  after which Barbarossa finally  in the Peace of Venice of 1177  recognized Alexander III as pope  On 12 March 1178 Alexander III returned to Rome  which he had been compelled to leave twice  the first time between 1162 and 23 November 1165  when he was sent into exile in Campania by Oddone Frangipane following his brief arrest and detainment  and again in 1167  The first period he spent in France  the latter chiefly in Gaeta  Benevento  Anagni  and Venice   3  Alexander s politics  Alexander III was the first pope known to have paid direct attention to missionary activities east of the Baltic Sea  He had created the Archbishopric of Uppsala in Sweden in 1164 probably at the suggestion of his close friend Eskil  Archbishop of Lund   exiled in Clairvaux  France  due to a conflict with the Danish king  The latter appointed a Benedictine monk Fulco as a bishop in Estonia  In 1171  Alexander became the first pope to address the situation of the Church in Finland  with Finns allegedly harassing priests and only relying on God in time of war   In March 1179  Alexander III held the Third Council of the Lateran  one of the most important mediaeval church councils  reckoned by the Roman Church as the eleventh ecumenical council  Its acts embodied several of the Pope s proposals for the betterment of the condition of the Church  among them the law requiring that no one could be elected pope without the votes of two thirds of the cardinals  The rule was altered slightly in 1996  but was restored in 2007  This synod marked the summit of Alexander III s power   Besides checkmating Barbarossa  Alexander humbled King Henry II of England for the murder of Thomas Becket in 1170  to whom he was unusually close  later canonizing Becket in 1173  This was the second English saint canonized by Alexander  the first being Edward the Confessor in 1161  Nonetheless  he confirmed the position of Henry as Lord of Ireland in 1172   Through the Papal bull Manifestis Probatum  issued on May 23  1179  he also recognized the right of Afonso I to proclaim himself King of Portugal – an important step in the process of Portugal becoming a recognized independent Kingdom  Afonso had been using the title of King since 1139    Even as a fugitive  Alexander enjoyed the favour and protection of Louis VII of France   Nevertheless  soon after the close of the synod  the Roman Republic forced Alexander III to leave the city  which he never re entered  and on 29 September 1179  some nobles set up the Antipope Innocent III  By the judicious use of money  however  Alexander III got him into his power  so that he was deposed in January 1180  In 1181  Alexander III excommunicated King William I of Scotland and put the kingdom under an interdict   He died at Civita Castellana on 30 August 1181   4  Notes  5  References  Myriam Soria Audebert   Pontifical Propaganda during the Schisms  Alexander III to the reconquest of
