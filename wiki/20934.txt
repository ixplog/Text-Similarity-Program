In computing terminology  a macro virus is a virus that is written in a macro language  that is to say  a language built into a software application such as a word processor  Since some applications  notably  but not exclusively  the parts of Microsoft Office  allow macro programs to be embedded in documents  so that the programs may be run automatically when the document is opened  this provides a distinct mechanism by which viruses can be spread  This is why it may be dangerous to open unexpected attachments in e mails  Modern antivirus software detects macro viruses as well as other types   1  Fundamentals  A macro is a series of commands and actions that help to automate some tasks   effectively a program but usually quite short and simple  However they are created  they need to be executed by some system which interprets the stored commands  Some macro systems are self contained programs  but others are built into complex applications  for example word processors  to allow users to repeat sequences of commands easily  or to allow developers to tailor the application to local needs   2  Operation  A macro virus can be spread through e mail attachments  discs  networks  modems  and the Internet and is notoriously difficult to detect  Uninfected documents contain normal macros  Most malicious macros start automatically when a document is opened or closed  A common way for a macro virus to infect a computer is by replacing normal macros with the virus  The macro virus replaces the regular commands with the same name and runs when the command is selected  In the cases where the macro is run automatically  the macro is opened without the user knowing   Once the application opens a file that contains a macro virus  the virus can infect the system  When triggered  it will begin to embed itself in other documents and templates  as well as future ones created  It may corrupt other parts of the system as well  depending on what resources a macro in this application can get access to  As the infected documents are shared with other users and systems  the virus will spread  The macro virus has also been known to be used as a way of installing software on a system without the user s consent as it can be used to look up software and web pages on the internet  go through with downloading and installing the software through the use of automated key presses etc   however  this is uncommon as it is usually un fruitful for the virus coder since the installed software is usually noticed and uninstalled by the user   A well known example of a macro virus is the Melissa Virus from 1999  Anyone who opened a document with the virus in Microsoft Office would  catch  the virus  The virus would then send itself by email to the first 50 people in the personâ€™s address book  This made the virus replicate at a fast rate   Since a macro virus depends on the application rather than the operating system  it can infect a computer running any operating system to which the targeted application has been ported  In particular  since Microsoft Word is available on Macintosh computers  word macro viruses can attack these as well as Windows platforms   The macro virus can be avoided by exercising caution when opening email attachments and other documents  Not all macro viruses can be detected by antivirus software   3  Common macro viruses  Concept virus  Melissa  computer virus   4  References  5  Further reading  Microsoft Corporation   2006   Retrieved June 18  2006  The Trustees of Indiana University   2006   Retrieved June 18  2006  from Security News & Information
