The economy of Vietnam is a developing planned economy and market economy  Since the mid 1980s  through the Đổi Mới reform period  Vietnam has made a shift from a highly centralized planned economy to a socialist oriented market economy which use both directive and indicative planning  see Five Year Plans of Vietnam   Over that period  the economy has experienced rapid growth  Nowadays  Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy  Almost all Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium enterprises  SMEs   Vietnam has become a leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for foreign investment in Southeast Asia  As the planned economy of Vietnam lost the momentum for productivity and sustainable growth  like most of the Communist economies in the world after the Cold War period  nowadays the economy of Vietnam relies largely on foreign direct investment to attract the capital from overseas to support its continual economic rigorousness   In 2013  the nominal GDP reached US$170 565 billion  with nominal GDP per capita of US$1 902  According to a forecast in December 2005 by Goldman Sachs  the Vietnamese economy was expected to become the 35th largest economy in the world with nominal GDP of US$436 billion and nominal GDP per capita of US$4 357 by 2020  According to a forecast by the PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2008  Vietnam may be the fastest growing of emerging economies by 2020  with a potential annual growth rate of about 10% in real dollar terms  which would increase the size of the economy to 70% of the size of the UK economy by 2040   Vietnam has been named among the Next Eleven and CIVETS countries  Despite economic achievement following Doi Moi  there exist issues that cause many analysts and researchers to remain worried about the pace of development in the country   1  History  Civilization in Vietnam had been built on agriculture  The feudal dynasties always considered agriculture as the main economic base  and their economic thoughts have been predicated on physiocracy  Land ownership was regulated  and such large scale works as dykes were conducted in the Red River Delta to facilitate wet rice cultivation  In peaceful times  soldiers were sent home to do farm work  Furthermore  the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture related ceremonies  Handicrafts and art were valued  but commerce was deprecated  and businessmen were called by the derogatory term con buôn  The national economy was self sufficient   From the 16th century  Confucianism was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop  Early commercial ports  such as Hội An  were constrained  and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat  This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy  and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony   Until the French colonization in the mid 19th century  Vietnam s economy had been mostly agrarian  subsistence based and village oriented  French colonizers  however  deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods  designating the South for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture  and the North for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources  Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions  the development of exports — coal from the North  rice from the South — and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce  The separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing regional economic differences  In the North  while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop  the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea  cotton  and tobacco  The colonial government also developed some extractive industries  such as the mining of coal  iron  and nonferrous metals  A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi  railroads  roads  power stations  and hydraulics works were constructed  In the South  agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation  and  nationally  rice and rubber were the main items of export  Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon Cholon area  Industry in the South consisted mostly of food processing plants and factories producing consumer goods   The development of exports—coal from the North  rice from the South—and the importation of French manufactured goods  however  stimulated internal commerce  A pattern of trade developed whereby rice from the South was exchanged for coal and manufactured goods from the North   When the North and South were divided politically in 1954  they also adopted different economic ideologies  communism in the North and capitalism in the South  Destruction caused by the Second Indochina War from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy  The situation was worsened by the country s 1 5 million military and civilian deaths  and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees  including tens of thousands of professionals  intellectuals  technicians and skilled workers   The government s Second Five Year Plan  1976–1981  aimed for extraordinarily high annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South  but the goals were not attained  The economy remained dominated by small scale production  low labor productivity  unemployment  material and technological shortfalls  and insufficient food and consumer goods  The more modest goals of the Third Five Year Plan  1981–85  were a compromise between ideological and pragmatic factions  they emphasized the development of agriculture and industry  Efforts were also made to decentralize planning and improve the managerial skills of government officials   Since reunification in 1975  the economy of Vietnam has been plagued by enormous difficulties in production  imbalances in supply and demand  inefficiencies in distribution and circulation  soaring inflation rates  and rising debt problems  Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period  Its peacetime economy is one of the poorest in the world and has shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production  Vietnam s gross domestic product   GDP  in 1984 was valued at US$18 1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year  Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops  bureaucratic mismanagement  elimination of private ownership  extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South  and military occupation of Cambodia  which resulted in a cutoff of much needed international aid for reconstruction    From the late 1970s until the early 1990s  Vietnam was a member of the Comecon  and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the Soviet Union and its allies  Following the dissolution of the Comecon and the loss of its traditional trading partners  Vietnam was forced to liberalize trade  devalue its exchange rate to increase exports  and embark on a policy of economic development   Throughout the 1990s  exports increased significantly  growing by as much as 20% to 30% in some years  In 1999  exports accounted for 40% of GDP  an impressive performance in the midst of the economic crisis which hit other countries in Asia  Vietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization  WTO  in 2007  which freed Vietnam from textile quotas enacted worldwide as part of the Multi Fibre Arrangement  MFA  in 1974  The MFA placed restrictions on the import by industrialized countries of textiles from developing countries  For China and other WTO members  however  textile quotas under the MFA expired at the end of 2004 as agreed in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in 1994   In 1986  Vietnam launched a political and economic renewal campaign  Đổi Mới  that introduced reforms to facilitate the transition from a centralized economy to a  socialist oriented market economy   Đổi Mới combined government planning with free market incentives and encouraged the establishment of private businesses and foreign investment  including foreign owned enterprises  By the late 1990s  the success of the business and agricultural reforms ushered in under Đổi Mới was evident  More than 30 000 private businesses had been created  the economy was growing at an annual rate of more than 7%  and poverty was nearly halved   1 1  Development since 1997  Vietnam s economic policy following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis has been a cautious one  emphasizing macroeconomic stability rather than growth  While the country shifted toward a more market oriented economy  the Vietnamese government still continues to hold a tight rein over major state sectors  such as the banking system  state owned enterprises and foreign trade  GDP growth fell to 6% in 1998 and 5% in 1999   The signing of the Bilateral Trade Agreement  BTA  between the USA and Vietnam on July 13  2000  was a significant milestone  The BTA provided for  normal trade relations   NTR  status of Vietnamese goods in the U S  market  It was expected that access to the U S  market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a manufacturing based  export oriented economy  Furthermore  it would attract foreign investment  not only from the U S   but also from Europe  Asia and other regions   In 2001  the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam approved a 10 year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector  while reaffirming the primacy of the state  Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global recession  making it the world s second fastest growing economy  At the same time  investment grew threefold and domestic savings quintupled   In 2003  the private sector accounted for more than one quarter of all industrial output  However  between 2003 and 2005  Vietnam fell dramatically in the World Economic Forum s global competitiveness report rankings  largely due to negative perceptions of the effectiveness of government institutions  Official corruption is endemic  and Vietnam lags in property rights  efficient regulation of markets  and labor and financial market reforms   Vietnam had an average GDP growth of 7 1% a year from 2000 to 2004  The GDP growth was 8 4% in 2005  the second largest in Asia  trailing only China s  The government estimated that GDP grew in 2006 by 8 17%  According to the Minister of Planning and Investment  the government targeted a GDP growth of around 8 5% in 2007   On November 7  2006  the General Council at the World Trade Organization  WTO  approved Vietnam s accession package  On January 11  2007  Vietnam officially became the WTO s 150th member  after 11 years of preparation  including eight years of negotiation  The country s access to the WTO was intended to provide an important boost to the economy  as it ensured that the liberalizing reforms continue and created options for trade expansion  However  the WTO accession also brought serious challenges  requiring the economy to open up to increasing foreign competition   Vietnam’s economy continues to expand at an annual rate in excess of 7%  one of the fastest growing in the world  but it grew from an extremely low base  as it suffered the crippling effect of the Vietnam War from the 1950s to the 1970s  as well as the austerity measures introduced in its aftermath  In 2012  the communist party was forced to apologise about the mismanagement of the economy after large numbers of SOEs went bankrupt and inflation rose  The main danger has been over the bad debt in the banks totalling to 15% and forecast growth is 5 2% for 2012 but this is also due to the global economic crisis  However the government have launched schemes to reform the economy such as lifting foreign ownership cap from 49% and partially privatizing the countries State owned companies which have been responsible for the recent economic downturn by the end of 2013 the government are expected to privatize 25–50 percent of most SOEs only maintaining control on public services and military  The recent reforms have created a major boom in the Vietnamese stock market as confidence in the Vietnamese economy are returning   Over the last 2 decades  Vietnam experienced a rapid construction booming that contributed a big part in economic growth but also caused  bubble  to the economy  Skyscrapers mushroomed in big cities  According to data of Skyscrapercity website  in 2013  the top three tallest buildings in Vietnam were the Hanoi Landmark 72  336m   the Hanoi Lotte Center  267m  and the Saigon Bitexco Financial Tower  263m    However  Vietnam s current economic turmoil has given rise to question of a new period of changing political economy   2  Economic sectors  2 1  Agriculture  fishery and forestry  In 2003  Vietnam produced an estimated 30 7 million cubic meters of wood  Production of sawn wood was a more modest 2 950 cubic meters  In 1992  in response to dwindling forests  Vietnam imposed a ban on the export of logs and raw timber  In 1997  the ban was extended to all timber products except wooden artifacts  During the 1990s  Vietnam began to reclaim land for forests with a tree planting program   Vietnam’s fishing industry  which has abundant resources given the country’s long coastline and extensive network of rivers and lakes  has generally experienced moderate growth  In 2003  the total catch was about 2 6 million tons  However  seafood exports increased fourfold between 1990 and 2002 to more than US$2 billion  driven in part by shrimp farms in the South and  catfish   which are a different species from their American counterparts  but are marketed in the United States under the same name  By selling vast quantities of shrimp and catfish to the U S   Vietnam triggered antidumping complaints by the U S   which imposed tariffs in the case of catfish and was considering doing the same for shrimp  In 2005  the seafood industry began to focus on domestic demand to compensate for declining exports   Vietnam is one of the top rice exporting countries in the world  but the limited sophistication of small scale Vietnamese farmers causes quality to suffer   Vietnam is the world s second largest exporter of coffee   2 2  Energy  mining and minerals  Petroleum is the main source of energy  followed by coal  which contributes about 25% of the country’s energy  excluding biomass   Vietnam’s oil reserves are in the range of 270–500 million tons  Oil production rose rapidly to in 2004  but output is believed to have peaked and is expected to decline gradually   In 2003  mining and quarrying accounted for 9 4% of GDP  and the sector employed 0 7% of the workforce  Petroleum and coal are the main mineral exports  Also mined are antimony  bauxite  chromium  gold  iron  natural phosphates  tin  and zinc   Crude oil is Vietnam’s leading export  as it exported a total of 17 million tons in 2002  In 2004  crude oil represented 22% of all export earnings  Petroleum exports are in the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining capacity  Vietnam’s only operational refinery  a facility at Cat Hai near Ho Chi Minh City  has a capacity of only   Refined petroleum accounted for 10 2% of total imports in 2002  As of 2012  Vietnam had only one refinery  the Dung Quat refinery  but a second one  the Nghi Son Refinery was planned and was scheduled for construction in May 2013   Vietnam’s anthracite coal reserves are estimated at 3 7 billion tons  Coal production was almost 19 million tons in 2003  compared with 9 6 million tons in 1999  Vietnam’s potential natural gas reserves are 1 3 trillion cubic meters  In 2002  Vietnam brought ashore 2 26 billion cubic meters of natural gas  Hydroelectric power is another source of energy  In 2004  Vietnam confirmed plans to build a nuclear power plant with Russian assistance  and a second by a Japanese group   2 3  Industry and manufacturing  Although the industrial sector contributed 40 1% of GDP in 2004  it employed only 12 9% of the workforce  In 2000  22 4% of industrial production was attributable to non state activities  From 1994 to 2004  the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10 3%  Manufacturing contributed 20 3% of GDP in 2004  while employing 10 2% of the workforce  From 1994 to 2004  manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11 2%  The top manufacturing sectors — food processing  cigarettes and tobacco  textiles  chemicals  and electrical goods — experienced rapid growth  Almost a third of manufacturing and retail activity is concentrated in Ho Chi Minh City   2 4  Services and tourism  In 2004  services accounted for 38 2% of gross domestic product  GDP   From 1994 to 2004  GDP attributable to the service sector grew at an average annual rate of 6 0%   In 2012  Vietnam welcomed 6 8 millions international visitors and the number is expected to be more than 7 millions in 2013  Vietnam keeps emerging as an attractive destination  In Tripadvisor s list of top 25 destinations Asia 2013 by travellers  choice  there are four cities of Vietnam  namely Hanoi  Ho Chi Minh City  Hoi An and Ha Long  2 5  Banking and finance  2 5 1  Banking  Most efficient and reliable banks are the largest  also state owned  ones  VietinBank  BIDV  and Vietcombank  The banking sector is dominated by the three institutions  There is also a trend of foreign investment into profitable banks  For example  VietinBank is currently owned by Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ  20%  and International Finance Corporation  10%  while Vietcombank is owned by Mizuho  15%    Vietnam s top five banks by registered capital  as of May 2013  USD VND exchange rate   21 000 VND   VietinBank $1 56 billion  32 661 billion VND   Agribank $1 39 billion  29 154 billion VND   Vietcombank $1 10 billion  23 174 billion VND   BIDV $1 10 billion  23 011 billion VND   Eximbank $0 59 billion  12 355 billion VND   2 5 2  Finance  Vietnam currently has two stock trading centers  the Ho Chi Minh City Securities Trading Center and the Hanoi Securities Trading Center  which run the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange  HOSE  and the Hanoi Stock Exchange  HNX   respectively   3  Currency  exchange rate and inflation  3 1  Currency  Vietnam s currency is the Vietnamese dong   3 2  Exchange rate  The exchange rate between the U S  dollar and the Vietnamese dong is important because the dong  although not freely convertible  is loosely pegged to the dollar through an arrangement known as a  crawling peg   This mechanism allows the dollar–dong exchange rate to adjust gradually to changing market conditions  As of June 28  2013  1 U S  dollar was equivalent to about 21 036 Vietnamese dong   Gold still maintains its position as a physical currency to a certain extent  although it has seen its economic role declining in recent years   Latest foreign exchange rates can be found    3 3  Inflation  Vietnam s economy experienced a hyperinflation period in its early years of the extensive reform program  especially from 1987 to 1992   In 2008  inflation was tracking at 20 3% for the first half of the year  higher than the 3 4% in 2000  but down significantly from 160% in 1988   In 2010  inflation stood at 11 5%  and 18 58% in 2011   At the end of 2012  inflation stood at 7 5%  a substantial decrease from 2011   4  Mergers and acquisitions  From 1999 to 2010  Vietnamese companies have been involved as either an acquiror or an acquired company in 1 320 mergers and acquisitions with a total value of US$7 7 billion  The number and value of deals hit US$2 0 billion in 2010  nearly US$3 5 billion in 2011  and US$3 7 billion in 2012  The number of deals rose from 50 in 2006 to nearly 200 in 2008 and almost 400 by 2011  The mergers and acquisitions activities faced many obstacles  lowering the rate of success of the transaction  Common obstacles come from culture  transparency and legal aspects   5  Foreign economic relations  Economic relations with the United States are improving  but are not without challenges  Although the United States and Vietnam reached a landmark bilateral agreement in December 2001  which helped increase Vietnam’s exports to the United States  disagreements over textile and catfish exports are hindering full implementation of the agreement  Further disrupting the economic relations between the two countries were efforts in Congress to link non humanitarian aid to Vietnam s human rights record  Barriers to trade and intellectual property are also within the purview of bilateral discussions   Given neighboring China s rapid economic ascendancy  Vietnam highly values its economic relationship with China  Following the resolution of most territorial disputes  trade with China is growing rapidly  and in 2004  Vietnam imported more products from China than from any other country  In November 2004  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN   of which Vietnam is a member  and China announced plans to establish the world’s largest free trade area by 2010   Vietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization  WTO  on January 11  2007   5 1  Foreign trade  5 1 1  Trades and trading partners  In 2007  Vietnam ran a trade deficit of US$14 1 billion  but the trade deficit for the first half of 2008 alone was measured at US$14 8 billion   In 2012  Vietnam recorded a trade surplus of US$780 million  the first trade surplus since 1993  Total trade reached US$228 13 billion  an increase of 12 1% from 2011   5 1 2  Export  In 2004  Vietnam’s exports of merchandise were valued at US$26 5 billion  and  were growing rapidly along with imports  Vietnam’s principal exports were crude oil  22 1%   textiles and garments  17 1%   footwear  10 5%   fisheries products  9 4%  and electronics  4 1%   The main destinations of Vietnam s exports were the United States  18 8%   Japan  13 2%   China  10 3%   Australia  6 9%   Singapore  5 2%   Germany  4 0%   and the United Kingdom  3 8%    In 2012  export rose 18 2%  valued at US$114 57 billion  Vietnam s main export market included the EU with US$20 billion  USA with US$19 billion  ASEAN with $US 17 8 billion  Japan with US$13 9 billion  China with US$14 2 billion  and South Korea with US$7 billion   In 2013  export rose 15 4%  valued at US$132 17 billion  of which export of electronics now comprised 24 5% of total export  compared with a 4 4% in 2008  Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam s export  valued about US$21 5 billions in 2013   5 1 3  Import  In 2004 Vietnam’s merchandise imports were valued at US$31 5 billion  and growing rapidly  Vietnam’s principal imports were machinery  17 5%   refined petroleum  11 5%   steel  8 3%   material for the textile industry  7 2%   and cloth  6 0%   The main origins of Vietnam’s imports were China  13 9%   Taiwan  11 6%   Singapore  11 3%   Japan  11 1%   South Korea  10 4%   Thailand  5 8%   and Malaysia  3 8%    Vietnam import rose 6 6% in 2012  valued at US$113 79 billion  Major import countries were China US$29 2 billion  ASEAN with US$22 3 billion  South Korea with US$16 2 billion  Japan with US$13 7 billion  EU with US$10 billion  and USA with US$6 3 billion   5 2  External debt  foreign aid  and foreign investment  In 2004  external debt amounted to US$16 6 billion  or 37%  of GDP   From 1988 to December 2004  cumulative foreign direct investment  FDI  commitments totaled US$46 billion  By December 2004  about 58% had been dispersed  About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities  and environs  of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi  In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1 5 billion  The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and construction  Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas  fisheries  construction  agriculture and forestry  transportation and communications  and hotels and tourism  From 2006 to 2010  Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%  Despite rising investments  foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination  as confirmed by recent survey by the Japan External Trade Organization of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam  Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities  office rentals and skilled labor  Corruption  bureaucracy  lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment  according to the U S  State Department  Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004   The World Bank s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives  to support Vietnam’s transition to a market economy  to enhance equitable and sustainable development and to promote good governance  From 1993 through 2004  Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of official development assistance  ODA   of which about US$14 billion  or 49%  has been disbursed  In 2004  international donors pledged ODA of US$2 25 billion  of which US$1 65 billion actually was disbursed  Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004  Japan  the World Bank  and the Asian Development Bank  From 2006 to 2010  Vietnam hopes to receive US$14 billion to US$15 billion of ODA   Pledged foreign direct investment US$21 3 billion for 2007 and a record US$31 6 billion for the first half of 2008  Mergers and acquisitions have gradually become an important channel of investments in the economy  especially after 2005   5 3  Free trade agreement  Vietnam signed most of the free trade agreements under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN   which currently include   ASEAN Free Trade Area  AFTA   ASEAN–Australia–New Zealand Free Trade Area  AANZFTA  is a free trade area between ASEAN and ANZCERTA  signed on 27 February 2009 and coming into
