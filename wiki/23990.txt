Puppis is a constellation in the southern sky  Puppis  the Poop Deck  was originally part of an over large constellation  the ship of  Jason and the Argonauts   Argo Navis  which centuries after its initial description  was divided into three parts  the other two being Carina  the keel and hull   and Vela  the sails of the ship   Puppis is the largest of the three constellations in square degrees  It is one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union   1  Notable features  Argo Navis was sub divided in 1752 by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille  forming Puppis  Despite the division  Lacaille kept Argo s Bayer designations  Therefore Carina has the α  β and ε  Vela has γ and δ  Puppis has ζ  and so on   1 1  Named stars  1 2  Planetary systems  Several extrasolar planet systems have been found around stars in the constellation Puppis  including   On July 1  2003  a planet was found orbiting the star HD 70642  This planetary system is much like Jupiter with a wide  circular orbit and a long period   On May 17  2006  HD 69830  the nearest star of this constellation  was discovered to have three Neptune mass planets  the first multi planetary system without any Jupiter like or Saturn like planets  The star also hosts an asteroid belt at the region between middle planet to outer planet   On June 21  2007  the first extrasolar planet found in the open cluster NGC 2423  was discovered around the red giant star NGC 2423 3  The planet is at least 10 6 times the mass of Jupiter and orbits at 2 1 AU distance   On September 22  2008  two Jupiter like planets were discovered around HD 60532  HD 60532 b has a minimum mass of 1 03 MJ and orbits at 0 759 AU and takes 201 3 days to complete the orbit  HD 60532 c has a minimum mass of 2 46 MJ and orbits at 1 58 AU and takes 604 days to complete the orbit   1 3  Deep sky objects  As the Milky Way runs through Puppis  there are a large number of open clusters in the constellation  M46 and M47 are two open clusters in the same binocular field  M47 can be seen with the naked eye under dark skies  and its brightest stars are 6th magnitude  Messier 93  M93  is another open cluster somewhat to the south  NGC 2451 is a very bright open cluster containing the star c Puppis and the near NGC 2477 is a good target for small telescopes  The star Pi Puppis is the main component of a bright group of stars known as Collinder 135   M46 is a circular open cluster with an overall magnitude of 6 1 at a distance of approximately 5400 light years from Earth  The planetary nebula NGC 2438 is superimposed  it is approximately 2900 light years from Earth  M46 is classified as a Shapley class f and a Trumpler class III 2 m cluster  This means that it is a rich cluster that appears distinct from the star field  however  it is not at its center  The cluster s stars  numbering between 50 and 100  have a moderate range in brightness   2  References   Citations   References  Ian Ridpath and Wil Tirion  2007   Stars and Planets Guide  Collins  London  ISBN 978 0 00 725120 9  Princeton University Press  Princeton  ISBN 978 0 691 13556 4   Richard Hinckley Allen  Star Names  Their Lore and Legend  New York  Dover   3  External links
