Purdue University  located in West Lafayette  Indiana  is the flagship university of the six campus Purdue University system  Purdue was founded on May 6  1869  as a land grant university when the Indiana General Assembly  taking advantage of the Morrill Act  accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science  technology  and agriculture in his name  The first classes were held on September 16  1874  with six instructors and 39 students   The university was founded with the gift of $150 000 from John Purdue  a Lafayette business leader and philanthropist  along with $50 000 from Tippecanoe County  and of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project  In 1869  it was decided that the new school would be built near the city of Lafayette and established as Purdue University  in the name of the institution’s principal benefactor   The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates  over 70 master’s and doctoral programs  and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine  In addition  Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 900 student organizations  Today  Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference  Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States   1  History  In 1865  the Indiana General Assembly voted to take advantage of the Morrill Land Grant Colleges Act of 1862  and began plans to establish an institution with a focus on agriculture and engineering  Communities throughout the state offered their facilities and money to bid for the location of the new college  Popular proposals included the addition of an agriculture department at Indiana University or at what is now Butler University  By 1869  Tippecanoe County’s offer included $150 000 from Lafayette business leader and philanthropist John Purdue  $50 000 from the county  and of land from local residents  On May 6  1869  the General Assembly established the institution in Tippecanoe County as Purdue University  in the name of the principal benefactor  Classes began at Purdue on September 16  1874  with six instructors and 39 students  Professor John S  Hougham was Purdue’s first faculty member and served as acting president between the administrations of presidents Shortridge and White  A campus of five buildings was completed by the end of 1874  Purdue issued its first degree  a Bachelor of Science in chemistry  in 1875 and admitted its first female students that fall   Emerson E  White  the university’s president from 1876 to 1883  followed a strict interpretation of the Morrill Act  Rather than emulate the classical universities  White believed that Purdue should be an  industrial college  and devote its resources toward providing a liberal  or broad  education with an emphasis on science  technology  and agriculture  He intended not only to prepare students for industrial work  but also to prepare them to be good citizens and family members  Part of White’s plan to distinguish Purdue from classical universities included a controversial attempt to ban fraternities  This ban was ultimately overturned by the Indiana Supreme Court and led to White’s resignation  The next president  James H  Smart  is remembered for his call in 1894 to rebuild the original Heavilon Hall  one brick higher  after it had been destroyed by a fire   By the end of the nineteenth century  the university was organized into schools of agriculture  engineering  mechanical  civil  and electrical   and pharmacy  and former U S  President Benjamin Harrison was serving on the board of trustees  Purdue’s engineering laboratories included testing facilities for a locomotive and a Corliss steam engine  one of the most efficient engines of the time  The School of Agriculture was sharing its research with farmers throughout the state with its cooperative extension services and would undergo a period of growth over the following two decades  Programs in education and home economics were soon established  as well as a short lived school of medicine  By 1925 Purdue had the largest undergraduate engineering enrollment in the country  a status it would keep for half a century   President Edward C  Elliott oversaw a campus building program between the world wars  Inventor  alumnus  and trustee David E  Ross coordinated several fundraisers  donated lands to the university  and was instrumental in establishing the Purdue Research Foundation  Ross’s gifts and fundraisers supported such projects as Ross–Ade Stadium  the Memorial Union  a civil engineering surveying camp  and Purdue University Airport  Purdue Airport was the country’s first university owned airport and the site of the country’s first college credit flight training courses  Amelia Earhart joined the Purdue faculty in 1935 as a consultant for these flight courses and as a counselor on women’s careers  In 1937  the Purdue Research Foundation provided the funds for the Lockheed Electra 10 E that Earhart flew on her attempted round the world flight   Every school and department at the university was involved in some type of military research or training during World War II  During a project on radar receivers  Purdue physicists discovered properties of germanium that led to the making of the first transistor  The Army and the Navy conducted training programs at Purdue and more than 17 500 students  staff  and alumni served in the armed forces  Purdue set up about a hundred centers throughout Indiana to train skilled workers for defense industries  As veterans returned to the university under the G I  Bill  first year classes were taught at some of these sites to alleviate the demand for campus space  Four of these sites are now degree granting regional campuses of the Purdue University system  Purdue’s on campus housing became racially desegregated in 1947  following pressure from Purdue President Frederick L  Hovde and Indiana Governor Ralph F  Gates   After the war  Hovde worked to expand the academic opportunities at the university  A decade long construction program emphasized science and research  In the late 1950s and early 1960s the university established programs in veterinary medicine  industrial management  and nursing  as well as the first computer science department in the United States  Undergraduate humanities courses were strengthened  although Hovde only reluctantly approved of graduate level study in these areas  Purdue awarded its first Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1960  The programs in liberal arts and education  formerly administered by the School of Science  were soon split into their own school   The official seal of Purdue was officially inaugurated during the university s centennial in 1969  Consisting of elements from emblems that had been used unofficially for 73 years  the current seal depicts a griffin  symbolizing strength  and a three part shield  representing education  research  and service   In recent years  Purdue’s leaders have continued to support high tech research and international programs  In 1987  U S  President Ronald Reagan visited the West Lafayette campus to give a speech about the influence of technological progress on job creation  In the 1990s  the university added more opportunities to study abroad and expanded its course offerings in world languages and cultures  The first buildings of the Discovery Park interdisciplinary research center were dedicated in 2004  Purdue launched a Global Policy Research Institute in 2010 to explore the potential impact of technical knowledge on public policy decisions   An administrative unit of Purdue University Libraries  Purdue University Press has its roots in the 1960 founding of Purdue University Studies by President Frederick Hovde on a $12 000 grant from the Purdue Research Foundation  This was the result of a committee appointed by President Hovde after the Department of English lamented the lack of publishing venues in the humanities  The first Editorial Board was headed by Robert B  Ogle  William Whalen  Director of the Office of Publications  became the part time Director of Purdue University Studies  Diane Dubriel was the first full time employee  Verna Emery was Managing Editor from 1977 to 1990  succeeded by Margaret Hunt who served until 2008  Other long serving employees who helped build the Press s reputation were Carolyn McGrew  1990 2002   and Beverly Carrell  1988 1996   and Donna VanLeer  1989 2008   On September 12  1974  Purdue University Studies became Purdue University Press  In June 1992 William Whalen retired and David Sanders was appointed the first full time Director of the Press serving until 1996  Also in 1992 administrative responsibility for the Press was transferred to the Dean of Libraries  Press Director Sanders was succeeded by Tom Bacher  1997 2008  and Charles T  Wilkinson  2008 2014   Under Sanders  Bacher  and Wilkinson the range of books published by the Press grew to reflect the work from other Colleges at Purdue University especially in the areas of agriculture  health  and engineering  Purdue University Press publishes print and ebook monograph series in a range of subject areas from literary and cultural studies to the study of the human animal bond  In 1993 Purdue University Press was admitted to membership of the Association of American University Presses  Purdue University Press publishes around 25 books a year and 20 learned journals in print  in print & online  and online only formats in collaboration with Purdue University Libraries   2  Campus  Purdue s
