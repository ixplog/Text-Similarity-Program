Radical feminism is a perspective within feminism that focuses on the hypothesis of patriarchy as a system of power that organizes society into a complex of relationships based on the assertion that male supremacy oppresses women  Radical feminism aims to challenge and overthrow patriarchy by opposing standard gender roles and oppression of women and calls for a radical reordering of society  Early radical feminism  arising within second wave feminism in the 1960s  typically viewed patriarchy as a  transhistorical phenomenon  prior to or deeper than other sources of oppression   not only the oldest and most universal form of domination but the primary form  and the model for all others  Later politics derived from radical feminism ranged from cultural feminism to more syncretic politics that placed issues of class  economics  etc  on a par with patriarchy as sources of oppression  Radical feminists locate the root cause of women s oppression in patriarchal gender relations  as opposed to legal systems  as in liberal feminism  or class conflict  as in socialist feminism and Marxist feminism    During the early years some radical feminists were criticized for emphasizing sex based discrimination at the expense of race  and class based discrimination  for being unwilling to work with men to effect change through political channels and for marginalizing lesbian sexuality   1  Theory and ideology  Radical feminists assert that society is a patriarchy in which the class of men are the oppressors of the class of women  Radical feminists seek to abolish patriarchy  Radical feminism posits the theory that  due to patriarchy  women have come to be viewed as the  other  to the male norm and as such have been systematically oppressed and marginalized  They also believe that the way to deal with patriarchy and oppression of all kinds is to address the underlying causes of these problems through revolution  They assert that men as a class benefit from the oppression of women   While some radical feminists propose that the oppression of women is the most fundamental form of oppression  one that cuts across boundaries of all other forms of oppression  others acknowledge the simultaneous and intersecting effect of other independent categories of oppression as well  These other categories of oppression may include  but are not limited to  oppression based on race  social class  perceived attractiveness  sexual orientation  and ability   Patriarchal theory is not always defined as a belief that all men always benefit from the oppression of all women  Patriarchal theory maintains that the primary element of patriarchy is a relationship of dominance  where one party is dominant and exploits the other party for the benefit of the former  Radical feminists believe that men use social systems and other methods of control to keep non dominant men and all women suppressed  Radical feminists also believe that eliminating patriarchy  and other systems which perpetuate the domination of one group over another  will liberate everyone from an unjust society   Some radical feminists called for women to govern women and men  among them Andrea Dworkin  Phyllis Chesler  Monique Wittig  in fiction   Mary Daly  Jill Johnston  and Robin Morgan   Redstockings co founder Ellen Willis wrote in 1984 that radical feminists  got sexual politics recognized as a public issue    created the vocabulary… with which the second wave of feminism entered popular culture    sparked the drive to legalize abortion    were the first to demand total equality in the so called private sphere    housework and child care     emotional and sexual needs    and  created the atmosphere of urgency  that almost led to the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment  The influence of radical feminism can be seen in the adoption of these issues by the National Organization for Women  NOW   a feminist group that had previously been focused almost entirely on economic issues   2  Movement  2 1  Roots  The ideology of radical feminism in the United States developed as a component of the women s liberation movement  It grew largely due to the influence of the civil rights movement that had gained momentum in the 1960s and many of the women who took up the cause of radical feminism had previous experience with radical protest in the struggle against racism  Chronologically  it can be seen within the context of second wave feminism that started in the early 1960s  The primary players and the pioneers of this second wave of feminism included the likes of Shulamith Firestone  Kathie Sarachild  Ti Grace Atkinson  Carol Hanisch  and Judith Brown  Many local women s groups in the late sixties  such as the UCLA Women s Liberation Front  WLF   offered diplomatic statements of radical feminism s ideologies  UCLA s WLF co founder Devra Weber recalls        the radical feminists were opposed to patriarchy  but not necessarily capitalism  In our group at least  they opposed so called male dominated national liberation struggles     These women helped secure the bridge that translated radical protest for racial equality over to the struggle for women s rights  by witnessing the discrimination and oppression to which the black population was subjected  they were able to gain strength and motivation to do the same for their fellow women  They took up the cause and advocated for a variety of women s issues  including abortion  the Equal Rights Amendment  access to credit  and equal pay  They failed to stir up enough interest among most of the women s fringe groups of society  A majority of women of color did not participate a great deal in the formation of radical feminist movement because it did not address many issues that were relevant to those from a working class background  of which they were a sizeable part  But for those who felt compelled enough to stand up for the cause  radical action was needed  and so they took to the streets and formed consciousness raising groups to rally support for the cause and recruit people who would be willing to fight for it  Later on however  Second Wave radical feminism saw greater numbers of black feminists and other women of color participating   In the 1960s  radical feminism emerged simultaneously within liberal feminist and working class feminist discussions  first in the United States  then in the United Kingdom and Australia  Those involved had gradually come to believe that it was not only the middle class nuclear family oppressed women  but that it was also social movements and organizations that claimed to stand for human liberation  notably the counterculture  the New Left  and Marxist political parties  all of which they considered to be male dominated and male oriented  Women in countercultural groups related that the gender relations present in such groups were very much those of mainstream culture   In the United States  radical feminism developed as a response to some of the perceived failings of both New Left organizations such as the Students for a Democratic Society  SDS  and feminist organizations such as NOW  Initially concentrated mainly in big cities like New York  Chicago  Boston  Washington  DC  and on the West Coast  radical feminist groups spread across the country rapidly from 1968 to 1972   In the United Kingdom  feminism developed out of discussions within community based radical women s organizations and discussions by women within the Trotskyist left  Radical feminism was imported into the UK by American radical feminists and seized on by British radical women as offering an exciting new theory to replace Trotskyism  As the 1970s progressed  British feminists split into two major schools of thought  socialist and radical  In 1977  another split occurred  with a third grouping calling itself  revolutionary feminism  breaking away from the other two   Australian radical feminism developed slightly later  during an extended period of social radicalization  largely as an expression of that radicalization   Radical feminists introduced the use of consciousness raising  CR  groups  These groups brought together intellectuals  workers  and middle class women in developed Western countries to discuss their experiences  During these discussions  women noted a shared and repressive system regardless of their political affiliation or social class  Based on these discussions  the women drew the conclusion that ending patriarchy was the most necessary step towards a truly free society  These consciousness raising sessions allowed early radical feminists to develop a political ideology based on common experiences women faced with male supremacy  Consciousness raising was extensively used in chapter sub units of the National Organization for Women  NOW  during the 1970s  The feminism that emerged from these discussions stood first and foremost for the liberation of women  as women  from the oppression of men in their own lives  as well as men in power  Radical feminism claimed that a totalizing ideology and social formation—patriarchy  government or rule by fathers —dominated women in the interests of men   Within groups such as New York Radical Women  1967–1969    no relation to Radical Women  a present day socialist feminist organization   which Ellen Willis characterized as  the first women s liberation group in New York City   a radical feminist ideology began to emerge that declared that  the personal is political  and  sisterhood is powerful   formulations that arose from these consciousness raising sessions  New York Radical Women fell apart in early 1969 in what came to be known as the  politico feminist split  with the  politicos  seeing capitalism as the source of women s oppression  while the  feminists  saw male supremacy as  a set of material  institutionalized relations  not just bad attitudes   The feminist side of the split  which soon began referring to itself as  radical feminists   soon constituted the basis of a new organization  Redstockings  At the same time  Ti Grace Atkinson led  a radical split off from NOW   which became known as The Feminists  A third major stance would be articulated by the New York Radical Feminists  founded later in 1969 by Shulamith Firestone  who broke from the Redstockings  and Anne Koedt   During this period  the movement produced  a prodigious output of leaflets  pamphlets  journals  magazine articles  newspaper and radio and TV interviews   Many important feminist works  such as Koedt s essay The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm  1970  and Kate Millet s book Sexual Politics  1970   emerged during this time and in this milieu   2 2  Ideology emerges and diverges  At the beginning of this period   heterosexuality was more or less an unchallenged assumption   Among radical feminists  the view became widely held that  thus far  the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s  in particular  the decreasing emphasis on monogamy  had been largely gained by men at women s expense  This assumption of heterosexuality would soon be challenged by the rise of political lesbianism  closely associated with Atkinson and The Feminists  The belief that the sexual revolution was a victory of men over women would eventually lead to the women s anti pornography movement of the late 1970s   Redstockings and The Feminists were both radical feminist organizations  but held rather distinct views  Most members of Redstockings held to a materialist and anti psychologistic view  They viewed men s oppression of women as ongoing and deliberate  holding individual men responsible for this oppression  viewing institutions and systems  including the family  as mere vehicles of conscious male intent  and rejecting psychologistic explanations of female submissiveness as blaming women for collaboration in their own oppression  They held to a view—which Willis would later describe as  neo Maoist —that it would be possible to unite all or virtually all women  as a class  to confront this oppression by personally confronting men   The Feminists held a more idealistic  psychologistic  and utopian philosophy  with a greater emphasis on  sex roles   seeing sexism as rooted in  complementary patterns of male and female behavior   They placed more emphasis on institutions  seeing marriage  family  prostitution  and heterosexuality as all existing to perpetuate the  sex role system   They saw all of these as institutions to be destroyed  Within the group  there were further disagreements  such as Koedt s viewing the institution of  normal  sexual intercourse as being focused mainly on male sexual or erotic pleasure  while Atkinson viewed it mainly in terms of reproduction  In contrast to the Redstockings  The Feminists generally considered genitally focused sexuality to be inherently male  Ellen Willis would later write that insofar as the Redstockings considered abandoning heterosexual activity  they saw it as a  bitter price  they  might have to pay for  their  militance   whereas The Feminists embraced separatist feminism as a strategy   The New York Radical Feminists  NYRF  took a more psychologistic  and even biologically determinist  line  They argued that men dominated women not so much for material benefits as for the ego satisfaction intrinsic in domination  Similarly  they rejected the Redstockings view that women submitted only out of necessity or The Feminists  implicit view that they submitted out of cowardice  but instead argued that social conditioning simply led most women to accept a submissive role as  right and natural    2 3  Action  Radical feminism was not and is not only a movement of ideology and theory  Radical feminists also take direct action  In 1968  they protested against the Miss America pageant by throwing high heels and other feminine accoutrements into a garbage bin  to represent freedom  In 1970  they also staged a sit in at the Ladies  Home Journal  In addition  they held speakouts about topics such as rape   2 4  Radical egalitarianism  Because of their commitment to radical egalitarianism  most early radical feminist groups operated initially without any formal internal structure  When informal leadership developed  it was often resented  Many groups ended up expending more effort debating their own internal operations than dealing with external matters  seeking to  perfect a perfect society in microcosm  rather than focus on the larger world  Resentment of leadership was compounded by the view that all  class striving  was  male identified   In the extreme  exemplified by The Feminists  the upshot  according to Ellen Willis  was  unworkable  mechanistic demands for an absolutely random division of labor  taking no account of differences in skill  experience  or even inclination    The result   writes Willis   was not democracy but paralysis   When The Feminists began to select randomly who could talk to the press  Ti Grace Atkinson quit the organization she had founded   2 5  Social organization and aims in the U S  and Australia  Radical feminists have generally formed small activist or community associations around either consciousness raising or concrete aims  Many radical feminists in Australia participated in a series of squats to establish various women s centres  and this form of action was common in the late 1970s and early 1980s  By the mid 1980s many of the original consciousness raising groups had dissolved  and radical feminism was more and more associated with loosely organized university collectives  Radical feminism can still be seen  particularly within student activism and among working class women   In Australia  many feminist social organizations accepted government funding during the 1980s  and the election of a conservative government in 1996 crippled these organizations   While radical feminists aim to dismantle patriarchal society in a historical sense  their immediate aims are generally concrete  Some common demands include   Expanding reproductive rights   Changing the organizational sexual culture  e g   breaking down traditional gender roles and reevaluating societal concepts of femininity and masculinity  a common demand in U S  universities during the 1980s   In this  they often form tactical alliances with other currents of feminism   2 6  Other nations  The movement also arose in Israel among Jews   3  Views on the sex industry  Radical feminists have written about a wide range of issues regarding the sex industry   which they tend to oppose   including but not limited to  harm to women during the production of pornography  the social harm from consumption of pornography  the coercion and poverty that leads women to become prostitutes  the long term effects of prostitution  the raced and classed nature of prostitution  and the often inherent male dominance over women in prostitution as well as pornography   3 1  Views on prostitution  Radical feminists argue that  in most cases  prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice  They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking  or  when it is an independent decision  it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity  or of serious underlying problems  such as drug addiction  past trauma  such as child sexual abuse  and other unfortunate circumstances   Radical feminists point out that women from the lowest socioeconomic classes—impoverished women  women with a low level of education  women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities—are overrepresented in prostitution all over the world   If prostitution is a free choice  why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it    MacKinnon  1993   A large percentage of prostitutes polled in one study of 475 people involved in prostitution reported that they were in a difficult period of their lives and most wanted to leave the occupation  Catharine MacKinnon argues that  In prostitution  women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with  The money thus acts as a form of force  not as a measure of consent  It acts like physical force does in rape    They believe no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no people should have the right to consent to the oppression of others  In the words of Kathleen Barry  consent is not a “good divining rod as to the existence of oppression  and consent to violation is a fact of oppression  Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of “consent ” since even in slavery there was some consent  if consent is defined as inability to see  or feel any alternative ”  Andrea Dworkin stated her opinions as   Prostitution in and of itself is an abuse of a woman s body  Those of us who say this are accused of being simple minded  But prostitution is very simple   …  In prostitution  no woman stays whole  It is impossible to use a human body in the way women s bodies are used in prostitution and to have a whole human being at the end of it  or in the middle of it  or close to the beginning of it  It s impossible  And no woman gets whole again later  after ”  Radical feminist thinking has analyzed prostitution as a cornerstone of patriarchal domination and sexual subjugation of women that impacts negatively not only on the women and girls in prostitution but on all women as a group because prostitution continually affirms and reinforces patriarchal definitions of women as having a primary function to serve men sexually  They claim it is crucial that society does not replace one patriarchal view on female sexuality   e g   that women should not have sex outside marriage a relationship and that casual sex is shameful for a woman  etc    with another similarly oppressive and patriarchal view   acceptance of prostitution  a sexual practice which is based on a highly patriarchal construct of sexuality  that the sexual pleasure of a woman is irrelevant  that her only role during sex is to submit to the man’s sexual demands and to do what he tells her  that sex should be controlled by the man and that the woman’s response and satisfaction are irrelevant  These feminists argue that sexual liberation for women cannot be achieved as long as we normalize unequal sexual practices where a man dominates a woman   They see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women  as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client  They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position  reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client  These feminists believe that many clients use the services of prostitutes because they enjoy the  power trip  they derive from the act and the control they have over the woman during the sexual activity  Catharine MacKinnon argues that prostitution  isn t sex only  it’s you do what I say  sex    Radical feminists strongly object to the patriarchal ideology which has been one of the justifications for the existence of prostitution throughout history  and which they say continues to justify it in many cultures   that is  that prostitution is a  necessary evil   as men cannot control themselves  and thus it is  necessary  that a small number of women be  sacrificed  to be used and abused by men  in order to protect  chaste  women from rape and harassment  These feminists see prostitution as a form of slavery  and say that  far from decreasing rape rates  prostitution leads to a sharp increase in sexual violence against women  by sending the message that it is acceptable for a man to treat a woman as a sexual instrument over which he has total control  Melissa Farley argues that Nevada s high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U S  states for sexual assault crimes  saying   Nevada s rape rate is higher than the U S  average and way higher than the rape rate in California  New York and New Jersey  Why is this  Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them  are disrespected by men  and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women    Indigenous women the world over are particularly targeted for prostitution  In Canada  New Zealand  Mexico  and Taiwan  studies have shown that indigenous women are at the bottom of the race and class hierarchy of prostitution  often subjected to the worst conditions  most violent demands and sold at the lowest price  It is common for indigenous women to be over represented in prostitution when compared with their total population  This is as a result of the combined forces of colonialism  physical displacement from ancestral lands  destruction of indigenous social and cultural order  misogyny  globalization neoliberalism  race discrimination and extremely high levels of violence perpetrated against them   3 2  Views on pornography  Radical feminists  notably Catherine MacKinnon  charge that the production of pornography entails physical  psychological  and or economic coercion of the women who perform and model in it  This is said to be true even when the women are being presented as enjoying themselves  It is also argued that much of what is shown in pornography is abusive by its very nature  Gail Dines holds that pornography  exemplified by gonzo pornography  is becoming increasingly violent and that women who perform in pornography are brutalized in the process of its production   Radical feminists point to the testimony of well known participants in pornography  such as Traci Lords and Linda Boreman  and argue that most female performers are coerced into pornography  either by somebody else  or by an unfortunate set of circumstances  The feminist anti pornography movement was galvanized by the publication of Ordeal  in which Linda Boreman  who under the name of  Linda Lovelace  had starred in Deep Throat  stated that she had been beaten  raped  and pimped by her husband Chuck Traynor  and that Traynor had forced her at gunpoint to make scenes in Deep Throat  as well as forcing her  by use of both physical violence against Boreman as well as emotional abuse and outright threats of violence  to make other pornographic films  Dworkin  MacKinnon  and Women Against Pornography issued public statements of support for Boreman  and worked with her in public appearances and speeches   Radical feminists hold the view that pornography contributes to sexism  arguing that in pornographic performances the actresses are reduced to mere receptacles—objects—for sexual use and abuse by men  They argue that the narrative is usually formed around men s pleasure as the only goal of sexual activity  and that the women are shown in a subordinate role  Some opponents believe pornographic films tend to show women as being extremely passive  or that the acts which are performed on the women are typically abusive and solely for the pleasure of their sex partner  On face ejaculation and anal sex are increasingly popular among men  following trends in porn  MacKinnon and Dworkin defined pornography as  the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words    Radical feminists say that consumption of pornography is a cause of rape and other forms of violence against women  Robin Morgan summarizes this idea with her often quoted statement   Pornography is the theory  and rape is the practice    Radical feminists charge that pornography eroticizes the domination  humiliation  and coercion of women  and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment  MacKinnon argued that pornography leads to an increase in sexual violence against women through fostering rape myths  Such rape myths include the belief that women really want to be raped and that they mean yes when they say no  Additionally  according to MacKinnon  pornography desensitizes viewers to violence against women  and this leads to a progressive need to see more violence in order to become sexually aroused  an effect she claims is well documented   German radical feminist Alice Schwarzer is one proponent of the point of view according to which pornography gives a distorted view of men and women s bodies  as well as the actual sexual act  often showing the performers with synthetic implants or exaggerated expressions of pleasure  as well as fetishes that are not the norm  such as watersports  being presented as popular and normal   4  Radical lesbian feminism  Radical lesbians is a movement within radical feminism  distinguished from other radical feminists through their ideological roots in political lesbianism   5  Views on transgenderism  A dispute began in 1973  when the West Coast Lesbian Conference split over a scheduled performance by the transgender folksinger Beth Elliott  In 1979 Janice Raymond released the book The Transsexual Empire  which she framed as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment  Sheila Jeffreys argues that transgenderism is not immutable and thus does not warrant radical medical intervention  considers detransitioners to be evidence of this  and describes genital reassignment surgery as  mutilation   Jeffreys also argues that  the vast majority of transsexuals still subscribe to the traditional stereotype of women  and that by transitioning medically and socially  trans women are  constructing a conservative fantasy of what women should be  They are inventing an essence of womanhood which is deeply insulting and restrictive   Throughout Gender Hurts  A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism cowritten with Lorene Gottschalk  Jeffreys insists on using male pronouns to refer to trans women claiming that  use by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste   Julie Bindel said  I don t have a problem with men disposing of their genitals  but it does not make them women  in the same way that shoving a bit of vacuum hose down your 501s  jeans  does not make you a man   As of 2009 Bindel maintained that  people should question the basis of the diagnosis of male psychiatrists  at a time when gender polarisation and homophobia work hand in hand   She argues that  Iran carries out the highest number of sex change surgeries in the world  because  surgery is an attempt to keep gender stereotypes intact  and that  the idea that certain distinct behaviours are appropriate for males and females underlies feminist criticism of the phenomenon of  transgenderism     According to the Guardian editor  her article  Gender benders  beware  was criticized by international LGBT lobbies among local readers  receiving many letters condemning it and the Guardian for publishing it from transsexual people as well as doctors  therapists and academics  He explained that Bindel understood that there were problems with the way the article was written and agreed with one therapist claiming that the column abused an already abused minority   Some radical feminists have advocated for the exclusion of trans women from feminist events  a source of much controversy  Lisa Vogel  the Michfest event organizer claimed that protesters from Camp Trans responded to this controversy with vandalism  They argue that trans women cannot be counted as women because they were not born biologically female  Such radical feminists hold that trans women have enjoyed male privilege by virtue of being assigned male at birth and their insistence on acceptance is a type of male entitlement  Some radical feminists reject the notion of a female brain  They believe that the differences in behaviour between men and women are a result of different socialization and believe that   in the words of Lierre Keith   femininity is  ritualized submission   In this view  gender is less an identity than a caste position and transgenderism is an obstacle to gender abolition  These views are not widely held by feminists  are rejected by many trans women and are often labeled transphobic   The term TERF  trans exclusionary radical feminist  has been used by transgender people and allies to refer to radical feminists who hold such views  The term is considered a slur by those at whom it is directed  such as Elizabeth Hungerford   6  Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism  Ellen Willis  1984 essay Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism reflects the radical feminism which she helped define in the late 60s  Within the New Left  Willis writes  radical feminists were accused of being  bourgeois    antileft   or even  apolitical   whereas they saw themselves as further  radicalizing the left by expanding the definition of radical   Radical feminists have tended to be white and middle class  Willis hypothesized that this was  at least in part  because  most black and working class women could not accept the abstraction of feminist issues from race and class issues   the resulting narrow demographic base  in turn  limited the validity of generalizations based on radical feminists  personal experiences of gender relations  Many early radical feminists broke political ties with  male dominated left groups   or would work with them only in ad hoc coalitions   Some feminists  most notably Alice Echols and Ellen Willis  held that after about 1975 most of what continued to be called  radical feminism  represents a narrow subset of what was originally a more ideologically diverse movement  Willis saw this as an example of a  conservative retrenchment  that occurred when the  expansive prosperity and utopian optimism of the  60s succumbed to an era of economic limits and political backlash   They label this dominant tendency  cultural feminism  and view it as a  neo Victorian  ideology coming out of radical feminism but ultimately antithetical to it  Willis drew the contrast that early radical feminism saw itself as part of a broad left politics  whereas much of what succeeded it in the 1970s and early 1980s  both cultural feminism and liberal feminism  took the attitude that  left politics were  male  and could be safely ignored   She further wrote that whereas the original radical feminism  challenge d  the polarization of the sexes   cultural feminism simply embraces the  traditional feminine virtues   Critics of cultural feminism hold that cultural feminist ideas on sexuality severely polarized feminism  leading to the feminist sex wars of the 1980s  Critics of Echols and Willis hold that they conflate several tendencies within radical feminism  not all of which are properly called  cultural feminism  and that cultural feminism is not radical feminism  and emphasize a greater continuity between early and contemporary radical feminism   Also  Willis  although very much a part of early radical feminism and continuing to hold that it played a necessary role in placing feminism on the political agenda  later criticised its inability  to integrate a feminist perspective with an overall radical politics   while viewing this limitation as inevitable in the historical context of the times  In part this limitation arose from the fact that consciousness raising  as  the primary method of understanding women s condition  in the movement at this time and its  most successful organizing tool   led to an emphasis on personal experience that concealed  prior political and philosophical assumptions    Willis  writing in 1984  was critical of the notion that all hierarchies are  more specialized forms of male supremacy  as preventing adequate consideration of the possibility that  the impulse to dominate… could be a universal human characteristic that women share  even if they have mostly lacked the opportunity to exercise it   Further  the view of oppression of women as a  transhistorical phenomenon  allowed middle class white women to minimize the benefits of their own race and class privilege and tended to exclude women from history  Further  Willis wrote that the movement never developed  a coherent analysis of either male or female psychology  and that it ultimately raised hopes that its narrow  commitment to the sex class paradigm  could not fulfill  when those hopes were dashed  according to Willis the resulting despair was the foundation of withdrawal into counterculturalism and cultural feminism   7  See also
