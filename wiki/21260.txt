North Korea s economy is a centrally planned system  yet the role of market allocation schemes is limited  Although there have been scattered and limited attempts at decentralization  as of 2014  Pyongyang s basic adherence to a rigid centrally planned economy continues  as does its reliance on fundamentally non pecuniary incentives  There have been reports of economic liberalisation  particularly after Kim Jong un assumed the leadership in 2012  but recent reports conflict over what is happening   The collapse of communist governments around the world in 1991  particularly North Korea s principal source of support  the Soviet Union  forced the North Korean economy to realign its foreign economic relations  including increased economic exchanges with South Korea   North Korea had a similar GDP per capita to its neighbor South Korea from the aftermath of the Korean War until the mid 1970s  but with a GDP per capita of less than $2 000 in the late 1990s and early 21st century  North Korea remains as one of the world s poorest and least developed countries  in sharp contrast to South Korea  which has one of the largest and most diversified economies in the world   1  Size of the North Korean economy  Estimating gross national product in North Korea is a difficult task because of dearth of economic data and the problem of choosing an appropriate rate of exchange for the North Korean won  the nonconvertible North Korean currency  The South Korean government s estimate placed North Korea s GNP in 1991 at US$22 9 billion  or US$1 038 per capita  In contrast  South Korea posted US$237 9 billion of GNP and a per capita income of US$5 569 in 1991  North Korea s GNP in 1991 showed a 5 2% decline from 1989  and preliminary indications were that the decline would continue  South Korea s GNP  by contrast  expanded by 9 3% and 8 4%  respectively  in 1990 and 1991   It is estimated that North Korea s GNP nearly halved between 1990 and 1999   In 2014  the Bank of Korea estimated that the real GDP of North Korea in 2013 was 30 839 billion South Korean won  The same year  it published the following estimates of North Korea s GDP growth   2  History  2 1  Colonial period and post World War II  Beginning in the mid 1920s  the Japanese colonial administration concentrated its industrial development efforts in the comparatively under populated and resource rich northern portion of Korea  resulting in a considerable movement of people northward from the agrarian southern provinces of the Korean Peninsula   This trend was not reversed until after the end of World War II  when more than 2 million Koreans moved from North to South following the division of Korea into Soviet and American military zones of administration  This southward exodus continued after the establishment of the Democratic People s Republic of Korea  North Korea  in 1948 and during the 1950–53 Korean War  The North Korean population as of October 2008 was given as 24 million  compared with 48–50 million in South Korea   The post World War II division of the Korean Peninsula resulted in imbalances of natural and human resources  with disadvantages for both the North and the South  By most economic measures  after partition the North was better off in terms of industry and natural resources  The South  however  had two thirds of the work force  In 1945  about 65% of Korean heavy industry was in the North but only 31% of light industry  37% of agriculture  and 18% of the peninsula s total commerce   North and South Korea both suffered from the massive destruction caused during the Korean War  In the years immediately after the war  North Korea mobilized its labour force and natural resources in an effort to achieve rapid economic development  Large amounts of aid from other communist countries  notably the Soviet Union and the People s Republic of China  helped the regime achieve a high growth rate in the immediate postwar period   2 2  Efforts at modernization  In 1979  North Korea renegotiated much of its international debt  but in 1980 it defaulted on all of its loans except those from Japan  By the end of 1986  hard currency debt had reached more than US$1 billion  It also owed nearly $2 billion to communist creditors  principally the Soviet Union  The Japanese also declared North Korea in default  By 2000  taking into account penalties and accrued interest  North Korea s debt was estimated at $10–12 billion  By 2012  North Korea s external debt had grown to an estimated US$20 billion despite Russia reportedly writing off about $8 billion of debt in exchange for participation in natural resources development  Besides Russia  major creditors include Hungary  the Czech Republic and Iran   Largely because of these debt problems but also because of a prolonged drought and mismanagement  North Korea s industrial growth slowed  and per capita GNP fell below that of the South  By the end of 1979 per capita GNP in North Korea was about one third of that in the South  The causes for this relatively poor performance are complex  but a major factor is the disproportionately large percentage of GNP  possibly as much as 25%  that North Korea devotes to the military   There have been some minor efforts toward relaxing central control of the economy in the 1980s that involve industrial enterprises  Encouraged by Kim Jong Il s call to strengthen the implementation of the independent accounting system    tongnip ch aesanje  of enterprises in March 1984  interest in enterprise management and the independent accounting system has increased  as evidenced by increasing coverage of the topic in various North Korean journals  Under the system  factory managers still are assigned output targets but are given more discretion in making decisions about labour  equipment  materials  and funds   In addition to fixed capital  each enterprise is allocated a minimum of working capital from the state through the Central Bank and is required to meet various operating expenses with the proceeds from sales of its output  Up to 50% of the  profit  is taxed  the remaining half being kept by the enterprise for purchase of equipment  introduction of new technology  welfare benefits  and bonuses  As such  the system provides some built in incentives and some degree of micro level autonomy  unlike the budget allocation system  under which any surplus is turned over to the government in its entirety   Another innovation  the August Third People s Consumer Goods Production Movement  is centred on consumer goods production  This measure was so named after Kim Jong il made an inspection tour of an exhibition of light industrial products held in Pyongyang on August 3  1984  The movement charges workers to use locally available resources and production facilities to produce needed consumer goods  On the surface  the movement does not appear to differ much from the local industry programs in existence since the 1960s  although some degree of local autonomy is allowed  However  a major departure places output  pricing  and purchases outside central planning  In addition  direct sales stores have been established to distribute goods produced under the movement directly to consumers  The movement is characterized as a third sector in the production of consumer goods  alongside centrally controlled light industry and locally controlled traditional light industry  Moreover  there were some reports in the mid 1980s of increasing encouragement of small scale private handicrafts and farm markets  As of 1992  however  no move was reported to expand the size of private garden plots   All these measures appear to be minor stop gap measures to alleviate severe shortages of consumer goods by infusing some degree of incentives  In mid 1993  no significant moves signalling a fundamental deviation from the existing system had occurred  The reluctance to initiate reform appears to be largely political  This concern is based on the belief that economic reform will produce new interests that will demand political expression  and that demands for the institutionalization of such pluralism eventually will lead to political liberalization   Beginning in the mid 1980s  and particularly around the end of the decade  North Korea began slowly to modify its rigid self reliant policy  The changes  popularly identified as the open door policy  included an increasing emphasis on foreign trade  a readiness to accept direct foreign investment by enacting a joint venture law  the decision to open the country to international tourism  and economic cooperation with South Korea   The main targets of the Third Seven Year Plan of 1987–93 were to achieve the  Ten Long Range Major Goals of the 1980s for the Construction of the Socialist Economy   These goals  conceived in 1980  were to be fulfilled by the end of the decade  The fact that these targets were rolled over to the end of the Third Seven Year Plan is another indication of the disappointing economic performance during the Second Seven Year Plan  The three policy goals of self reliance  modernization  and scientification were repeated  Economic growth was set at 7 9% annually  lower than the previous plan  Although achieving the ten major goals of the 1980s is the main thrust of the Third Seven Year Plan  some substantial changes have been made in specific quantitative targets  For example  the target for the annual output of steel has been reduced by a third  from 15 million tons to 10 million tons  The output targets of cement and non ferrous metals—two major export items—have been increased significantly  The June 1989 introduction of the Three Year Plan for Light Industry as part of the Third Seven Year Plan is intended to boost the standard of living by addressing consumer needs  The Third Seven Year Plan gave a great deal of attention to developing foreign trade and joint ventures  the first time a plan has addressed these issues  By the end of 1991  however  two years before the termination of the plan  no quantitative plan targets had been made public  an indication that the plan has not fared well  The diversion of resources to build highways  theatres  hotels  airports  and other facilities in order to host the Thirteenth World Festival of Youth and Students in July 1989  must have had a negative impact on industrial and agricultural development  although the expansion and improvement of social infrastructure have resulted in some long term economic benefits   North Korea announced in December 1993 a 3 year transitional economic policy placing primary emphasis on agriculture  light industry  and foreign trade  However  lack of fertilizer  natural disasters  and poor storage and transportation practices have left the country more than a million tons per year short of grain self sufficiency  Moreover  lack of foreign exchange to purchase spare parts and oil for electricity generation left many factories idle   The shortage of foreign exchange because of a chronic trade deficit  a large foreign debt  and dwindling foreign aid has constrained economic development  In addition  North Korea has been diverting scarce resources from developmental projects to defence  it spent more than 20% of GNP on defence toward the end of the 1980s  a proportion among the highest in the world  These negative factors  compounded by the declining efficiency of the central planning system and the failure to modernize the economy  have slowed the pace of growth since the 1960s  The demise of the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and East European countries—North Korea s traditional trade partners and benefactors—has compounded the economic difficulties in the early 1990s   2 2 1  State Planning Commission  Although general economic policy objectives are decided by the Central People s Committee  CPC   it is the task of the State Planning Committee to translate the broad goals into specific annual and long term development plans and quantitative targets for the economy as a whole  as well as for each industrial sector and enterprise  Under the basic tenets of the 1964 reforms  the planning process is guided by the principles of  unified planning     ilwŏnhwa  and of  detailed planning     saebunhwa    Under  unified planning   regional committees are established in each province  city  and county to systematically coordinate planning work  These committees do not belong to any regional organization and are directly supervised by the State Planning Committee  As a result of a reorganization in 1969  they are separated into provincial planning committees  city county committees  and enterprise committees  for large scale enterprises    The various planning committees  under the auspices of the State Planning Committee  coordinate their planning work with the existing planning offices of the various economy related government organizations in each of the corresponding regional and local areas  The system attempts to enable the regional planning staffs to better coordinate with economic establishments in their areas  which are directly responsible to them with regard to planning  as well as to communicate directly with staff at the CPC   Detailed planning  seeks to construct plans with precise accuracy and scientific methods based on concrete assessment of the available resources  labour  funds  plant capacities  and all other necessary information   There are four stages in drafting the final national economic plan  The first stage is collecting and compiling preliminary statistical data  These figures  which are used as the basic planning data on the productive capacities of various economic sectors  originally are prepared by lower level economic units and aggregated on a national level by respective departments and committees  Simultaneously  the regional  local  and enterprise planning committees prepare their own data and forward them to the CPC  Through this two channel system of simultaneous but separate and independent preparation of statistical data by economic units and planning committees  the government seeks to ensure an accurate  objective  and realistic data base unfettered by local and bureaucratic bias  The second stage is preparing the control figures by the CPC based on the preliminary data in accordance with the basic plan goals presented by the Central People s Committee  In the third stage  a draft plan is prepared   The draft plan  prepared by the CPC  is the result of coordinating all draft figures submitted by the lower level economic units  which  in turn  base their drafts on the control figures handed down from the committee  In the fourth stage  the CPC submits a unified national draft plan to the Central People s Committee and the State Administration Council for confirmation  After approval by the Supreme People s Assembly  the draft becomes final and is distributed to all economic units as well as to regional and local planning committees  The plan then becomes legal and compulsory  Frequent directives from the central government contain changes in the plan targets or incentives for meeting the plan objectives   Although the central government is most clearly involved in the formulation and evaluation of the yearly and long term plans  it also reviews summaries of quarterly or monthly progress  Individual enterprises divide the production period into daily  weekly  ten day  monthly  quarterly  and annual periods  In general  the monthly plan is the basic factory planning period   The success of an economic plan depends on the quality and detail of information received  the establishment of realistic targets  coordination among different sectors  and correct implementation  High initial growth during the Three Year Plan and  to a lesser extent  during the Five Year Plan contributed to a false sense of confidence among the planners  Statistical overreporting—an inherent tendency in an economy where rewards lie in fulfilling the quantitative targets  particularly when the plan target year approaches—leads to overestimation of economic potential  poor product quality  and eventually to plan errors  Inefficient utilization of plants  equipment  and raw materials also add to planning errors  Lack of coordination in planning and production competition among sectors and regions cause imbalances and disrupt input output relationships  The planning reforms in 1964 were supposed to solve these problems  but the need for correct and detailed planning and strict implementation of plans was so great that their importance was emphasized in the report unveiling the Second Seven Year Plan  indicating that planning problems persisted in the 1980s   2 2 2  Ch ŏngsan ni Method  The Ch ŏngsan ni Method    of management was born out of Kim Il sung s February 1960 visit to the Ch ŏngsan ni Cooperative Farm in South P yŏngan Province  Kim and other members of the KWP Central Committee offered  on the spot guidance     hyŏnji chido  and spent four fifteen days instructing and interacting with the workers  The avowed objective of this new method is to combat  bureaucratism  and  formalism  in the farm management system   The leadership claimed that farm workers were unhappy and produced low output because low ranking functionaries of the Workers  Party of Korea  who expounded abstract Marxist theories and slogans  were using incorrect tactics that failed to motivate  To correct this  the leadership recommended that the workers receive specific guidance in solving production problems and be promised readily available material incentives  The Ch ŏngsan ni Method called for high ranking party officials  party cadres  and administrative officials to emulate Kim Il Sung by making field inspections  The system also provided opportunities for farmers to present their grievances and ideas to leading cadres and managers  Perhaps more important than involving administrative personnel in on site inspections was the increased use of material incentives  such as paid vacations  special bonuses  honorific titles  and monetary rewards  In fact  the Ch ŏngsan ni Method appeared to accommodate almost any expedient to spur production  The method  however  subsequently was undercut by heavy handed efforts to increase farm production and amalgamate farms into ever larger units  Actual improvement in the agricultural sector began with the adoption of the subteam contract system as a means of increasing peasant productivity by adjusting individual incentives to those of the immediate  small working group  Thus the increasing scale of collective farms was somewhat offset by the reduction in the size of the working unit   On the spot guidance  by high government functionaries  however  continues in the early 1990s  as exemplified by Kim Il Sung s visits to such places as the Wangjaesan Cooperative Farm in Onsŏng County and the Kyŏngsŏn Branch Experimental Farm of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences between August 20 and 30  1991   2 2 3  Taean Work System  The industrial management system developed in three distinct stages  The first stage was a period of enterprise autonomy that lasted until December 1946  The second stage was a transitional system based on local autonomy  with each enterprise managed by the enterprise management committee under the direction of the local people s committee  This system was replaced by the  one man management system      with management patterned along Soviet lines as large enterprises were nationalized and came under central control  The third stage  the Taean Work System    Taeanŭi saŏpch e   was introduced in December 1961 as an application and refinement of agricultural management techniques to industry  The Taean industrial management system grew out of the Ch ŏngsan ni Method   The highest managerial authority under the Taean system is the party committee  Each committee consists of approximately 25 to 35 members elected from the ranks of managers  workers  engineers  and the leadership of  working people s organizations  at the factory  A smaller  executive committee   about one quarter the size of the regular committee  has practical responsibility for day to day plant operations and major factory decisions  The most important staff members  including the party committee secretary  factory manager  and chief engineer  make up its membership  The system focuses on co operation among workers  technicians  and party functionaries at the factory level   Each factory has two major lines of administration  one headed by the manager  the other by the party committee secretary  A chief engineer and his or her assistants direct a general staff in charge of all aspects of production  planning  and technical guidance  Depending on the size of the factory  varying numbers of deputies oversee factory logistics  marketing  and workers  services  The supply of materials includes securing  storing  and distributing all materials for factory use  as well as storing finished products and shipping them from the factory   Deputies are in charge of assigning workers to their units and handling factory accounts and payroll  Providing workers  services requires directing any farming done on factory lands  stocking factory retail shops  and taking care of all staff amenities  Deputies in charge of workers  services are encouraged to meet as many of the factory s needs as possible using nearby agricultural cooperatives and local industries   The secretary of the party committee organizes all political activities in each of the factory party cells and attempts to ensure loyalty to the party s production targets and management goals  According to official claims  all management decisions are arrived at by consensus among the members of the party committee  Given the overwhelming importance of the party in the country s affairs  it seems likely that the party secretary has the last say in any major factory disputes   The Taean system heralded a more rational approach to industrial management than that practised previously  Although party functionaries and workers became more important to management under the new system  engineers and technical staff also received more responsibility in areas where their expertise could contribute the most  The system recognizes the importance of material as well as  politico moral  incentives for managing the factory workers  The  internal accounting system   a spin off of the  independent accounting system   grants bonuses to work teams and workshops that use raw materials and equipment most efficiently  These financial rewards come out of enterprise profits   A measure of the success of the Taean Work System is its longevity and its continued endorsement by the leadership  In his 1991 New Year s address marking the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of the system  Kim Il Sung said that the   Taean work system is the best system of economic management  It enables the producer masses to fulfill their responsibility and role as masters and to manage the economy in a scientific and rational manner by implementing the mass line in economic management  and by combining party leadership organically with administrative  economic  and technical guidance    2 2 4  Mass production campaigns  Parallel to management techniques such as the Ch ŏngsan ni Method and the Taean Work System  which were designed to increase output in the course of more normalized and regularized operations of farms and enterprises  the leadership continuously resorts to exhortations and mass campaigns to motivate the workers to meet output targets  The earliest and the most pervasive mass production campaign was the Ch ŏllima Movement  Introduced in 1958  and fashioned after China s Great Leap Forward  1958–60   the Ch ŏllima Movement organized the labour force into work teams and brigades to compete at increasing production  The campaign was aimed not only at industrial and agricultural workers but also at organizations in education  science  sanitation and health  and culture   In addition to work teams  units eligible for Ch ŏllima citations included entire factories  factory workshops  and such self contained units as a ship or a railroad station  The  socialist competition  among the industrial sectors  enterprises  farms  and work teams under the Ch ŏllima Movement frantically sought to complete the First Five Year Plan  1957–60   but instead created chaotic disruptions in the economy  The disruptions made it necessary to set aside 1959 as a  buffer year  to restore balance in the economy   Although the Ch ŏllima Movement was replaced in the early 1960s by the Ch ŏngsan ni Method and the Taean Work System  the regime s reliance on some form of mass campaign continued into the early 1990s  Campaigns conducted after the Ch ŏllima Movement have been narrower in scope and have concentrated on specific time frames for a particular industry or economic sector  Often  the mass production movement takes the form of a  speed battle —the  100 day speed battle  being most common  The fact that the leadership has to resort to these campaigns points to the weakness or improper functioning of the regular day to day management system  as well as to a lack of incentives for workers to achieve the desired economic results  The leadership frequently resorts to speed battles toward the end of a certain period  such as a month  a year  or a particular economic plan  to reach production targets  The  Speed of the 1990s  is designed to carry out the economic goals of the decade   2 3  Budget and finance  The state budget is a major government instrument in carrying out the country s economic goals  Expenditures represented about three quarters of GNP in the mid 1980s—the allocation of which reflected the priorities assigned to different economic sectors  Taxes were abolished in 1974 as  remnants of an antiquated society   This action  however  was not expected to have any significant effect on state revenue because the overwhelming proportion of government funds—an average of 98 1% during 1961 70—was from turnover  sales  taxes  deductions from profits paid by state enterprises  and various user fees on machinery and equipment  irrigation facilities  television sets  and water   In order to provide a certain degree of local autonomy as well as to lessen the financial burden of the central government  a  local budget system  was introduced in 1973  Under this system  provincial authorities are responsible for the operating costs of institutions and enterprises not under direct central government control  such as schools  hospitals  shops  and local consumer goods production  In return  they are expected to organize as many profitable ventures as possible and to turn over profits to the central government   Around December of every year  the state budget for the following calendar year is drafted  subject to revision around March  Typically  total revenue exceeds expenditure by a small margin  with the surplus carried over to the following year  The largest share of state expenditures goes to the  people s economy   which averaged 67 3% of total expenditures between 1987 and 1990  followed in magnitude by  socio cultural    defense   and  administration    Defense spending  as a share of total expenditures  has increased significantly since the 1960s  from 3 7% in 1959 to 19% in 1960  and  after averaging 19 8% between 1961 and 1966  to 30 4% in 1967  After remaining around 30% until 1971  the defense share decreased abruptly to 17% in 1972  and continued to decline throughout the 1980s  Officially  in both 1989 and 1990 the defense share remained at 12%  and for 1991 it was 12 3% with 11 6% planned for 1992  The declining trend is consistent with the government s announced intentions to stimulate economic development and increase the social benefits  However  Western experts estimate that actual military expenditures are higher than budget figures indicate   After decades of reported steady annual increases on both sides of the ledger  by 1994 income and spending alike had reached 41 5 billion won  just under US$20 billion at the rate of exchange then   Then Kim Il Sung died  and for four years the Supreme People s Assembly did not meet  supposedly as a sign of mourning  but this was also the worst period of famine   When  in 1999  the SPA finally reconvened  the then Finance Minister Yun Ki jong revealed  but did not try to explain  figures of barely 20 billion won for 1998   meaning both income and spending had plunged by half in just four years  In the 1999 budget  expenditures for the farming and power sectors were increased by 15% and 11%  respectively  compared with those of 1998   In the 2007 budget  it was estimated an increase in revenue at 433 2bn won  $3 072bn  $1 141won   In 2006  5 9% were considered the public revenue  whereas this year  this figure was raised to 7 1%   North Korea claims that it is the only state in the world that does not levy taxes  Taxes were abolished beginning on April 1  1974   2 4  Bonds  Since 2003  North Korean authorities issue government bonds called The  People s Life Bonds   It offers no interest over the 10 year lifespan  but  in the event purchasers win in a related lottery  the winner will be entitled to interest when the bonds are redeemed  Buyers of more than 1 million won worth of bonds will also be awarded with a decoration for their expression of affection for the home country by the North Korean government   North Korea sold bonds internationally in the late 1970s for 680 million Deutsche marks and 455 million Swiss francs  North Korea defaulted on these bonds by 1984  although the bonds remain traded internationally on speculation that the country will eventually perform on the obligations   3  Economic sectors  3 1  Industry  North Korea s self reliant development strategy assigned top priority to developing heavy industry  with parallel development in agriculture and light industry  This policy was achieved mainly by giving heavy industry preferential allocation of state investment funds  More than 50% of state investment went to the industrial sector during the 1954 76 period  47 6%  51 3%  57 0%  and 49 0%  respectively  during the Three Year Plan  Five Year Plan  First Seven Year Plan  and Six Year Plan   As a result  gross industrial output grew rapidly   As was the case with the growth in national output  the pace of growth has slowed markedly since the 1960s  The rate declined from 41 7% and 36 6% a year during the Three Year Plan and Five Year Plan  respectively  to 12 8%  16 3%  and 12 2%  respectively  during the First Seven Year Plan  Six Year Plan  and Second Seven Year Plan  As a result of faster growth in industry  that sector s share in total national output increased from 16 8% in 1946 to 57 3% in 1970  Since the 1970s  industry s share in national output has remained relatively stable  From all indications  the pace of industrialization during the Third Seven Year Plan up to 1991 is far below the planned rate of 9 6%  In 1990 it was estimated that the industrial sector s share of national output was 56%   Industry s share of the combined total of gross agricultural and industrial output climbed from 28% in 1946 to well over 90% in 1980  Heavy industry received more than 80% of the total state investment in industry between 1954 and 1976  81 1%  82 6%  80%  and 83%  respectively  during the Three Year Plan  Five Year Plan  First Seven Year Plan  and Six Year Plan   and was overwhelmingly favored over light industry   North Korea claims to have fulfilled the Second Seven Year Plan  1978–84  target of raising the industrial output in 1984 to 120% of the 1977 target  equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 12 2%  Judging from the production of major commodities that form the greater part of industrial output  however  it is unlikely that this happened  For example  the increase during the 1978 84 plan period for electric power  coal  steel  metal cutting machines  tractors  passenger cars  chemical fertilizers  chemical fibers  cement  and textiles  respectively  was 78%  50%  85%  67%  50%  20%  56%  80%  78%  and 45%  Raw materials were in short supply and so were energy and hard currency  Infrastructure decayed and machinery became obsolete  Unlike other socialist countries in the Eastern Europe  North Korea kept planning in a highly centralized manner and refused to liberalize economic management   In the mid 1980s  the speculation that North Korea would emulate China in establishing Chinese style special economic zones was flatly denied by then deputy chairman of the Economic Policy Commission Yun Ki pok  Yun became chairman as of June 1989   China s special economic zones typically are coastal areas established to promote economic development and the introduction of advanced technology through foreign investment  Investors are offered preferential tax terms and facilities  The zones  which allow greater reliance on market forces  have more decisionmaking power in economic activities than do provincial level units  Over the years  China has tried to convince the North Korean leadership of the advantages of these zones by giving tours of the various zones and explaining their values to visiting high level officials   In April 1982  Kim Il sung announced a new economic policy giving priority to increased agricultural production through land reclamation  development of the country s infrastructure舒especially power plants and transportation facilities舒and reliance on domestically produced equipment  There also was more emphasis on trade   In September 1984  North Korea promulgated a joint venture law to attract foreign capital and technology  The new emphasis on expanding trade and acquiring technology was not  however  accompanied by a shift in priorities away from support of the military  In 1991  North Korea announced the creation of a Special Economic Zone  SEZ  in the northeast regions of Rason  Rason Special Economic Zone  and Ch ŏngjin  Investment in this SEZ has been slow in coming  Problems with infrastructure  bureaucracy  uncertainties about the security of investments  and viability have hindered growth and development  Nevertheless thousands of small Chinese businesses had set up profitable operations in North Korea by 2011   A government research center  the Korea Computer Center  was set up in 1990  starting the slow development of an information technology industry   In 2013 and 2014 the State Economic Development Administration announced a number of smaller special economic zones covering export handling  mineral processing  high technology  gaming and tourism   3 1 1  Garment industry  The most successful export industry is the garment industry  Production is by a North Korean firm for a European or other foreign partner  by a Chinese firm operating in North Korea with a North Korean partner  or by North Korean workers working in Chinese or other foreign factories  Wages are the lowest in northeastern Asia   3 1 2  Automotive industry  The North Korean motor vehicle production establishes military  industrial and construction goals  with private car ownership by citizens remaining on low demand  Having Soviet origins   the subsequent practice of cloning foreign specimens  and a recent one automobile joint venture  North Korea has developed a wide range automotive industry with production of all types of vehicles  The basis for production is in an urban and off road mini  luxury  SUV cars  small  mid  heavy  and super heavy cargo  construction and off road trucks  a mini bus van  civilian and articulated buses  trolleybuses  and trams  However  the DPRK produces far fewer vehicles than its production capability due to the ongoing economic crisis  North Korea has not joined or collaborated with the OICA  or with any other automotive organization  so any critical information about its motor vehicle industry is limited   3 2  Power and energy  The energy sector is one of the most serious bottlenecks in the North Korean economy  Since 1990  the supply of oil  coal  and electricity declined steadily  and seriously affected all sectors of the economy  Crude oil was formerly imported by pipeline at “friendship prices” from the former USSR or China  but the withdrawal of Russian concessions and the reduction of imports from China brought down annual imports from about in 1988 to less than by 1997  As the imported oil was refined for fuels for transportation and agricultural machinery  a serious cutback in oil imports caused critical problems in transportation and agriculture   According to statistics compiled by the South Korean agency Statistics Korea based on International Energy Agency  IEA  data  per capita electricity consumption fell from its peak in 1990 of 1247 kilowatt hours to a low of 712 kilowatt hours in 2000  It has slowly risen since to 819 kilowatt hours in 2008  a level below that of 1970   North Korea has no coking coal  but has substantial reserves of anthracite in Anju  Aoji  Ŭndŏk   and other areas  Coal production peaked at 43 million tons in 1989 and steadily declined to 18 6 million tons in 1998  Major causes of coal shortages include mine flooding  and outdated mining technology  As coal was used mainly for industry and electricity generation  decrease in coal production caused serious problems in industrial production and electricity generation  Coal production may not necessarily increase significantly until North Korea imports modern mining technology   Electricity generation of North Korea peaked in 1989 at about 30 TWh  There were seven large hydroelectric plants in the 1980s  Four were along the Yalu River  built with Chinese aid  and supplying power to both countries  In 1989  60% of electricity generation was hydroelectric and 40% fossil fueled  mostly coal fired   In 1997  coal accounted for more than 80% of primary energy consumption and hydropower more than 10%  Net imports of coal represented only about 3% of coal consumption  Hydroelectric power plants generated about 65% of North Korea s electricity and coal fired thermal plants about 35% in 1997  However  with only 20% of the per capita electricity generation of Japan  the DPRK suffers from chronic supply shortages   Some hydroelectric facilities are believed to be out of operation due to damages from major flooding in 1995  Coal fired power plants have been running well under capacity in recent years  due in part to a serious decline in coal supply and in part to problems with transportation of coal  The electricity supply steadily declined and was 17 TWh in 1998  Since electricity generated should double up just to return to the 1989 level  power shortages will continue until coal production increases substantially and generating equipment is refurbished  Transmission losses are reported to be around 30%   3 3  Construction  Construction was once an active sector in North Korea  This was demonstrated not only through large housing programmes  of which most were visible in the high rise apartment blocks in Pyongyang  but also in the smaller modern apartment complexes widespread even in the countryside  These are dwarfed in every sense by  grand monumental edifices   The same may apply even to apparently economically useful projects such as the Namp o dam  which cost US$4bn   The years of economic contraction in the 1990s slowed this sector as it did others  the shell of the 105 story Ryugyŏng Hotel towered unfinished on Pyongyang’s skyline for over a decade  The Bank of Korea claims that construction’s share of GDP fell by almost one third between 1992 and 1994  from 9 1% to 6 3%  This accords with a rare official figure of 6% for 1993  when the sector was said to have employed 4 2% of the labour force  However  the latter figure excludes the Korean People s Army  which visibly does much of the country’s construction work   3 4  Banking  The Central Bank of North Korea  under the Ministry of Finance  has a network of 227 local branches  Several reissues of banknotes in recent years suggest that citizens are inclined to hoard rather than bank any savings that they make from their incomes  reportedly they now also prefer foreign currency  At least two foreign aid agencies have recently set up microcredit schemes  lending to farmers and small businesses   In late 2009  North Korea revalued its currency  effectively confiscating all privately held money above the equivalent of US$35 per person  The revaluation effectively wiped out the savings of many North Koreans  Days after the revaluation the won dropped 96% against the United States Dollar  Pak Nam gi  the director of the Planning and Finance Department of North Korea s ruling Workers  Party  was blamed for the disaster and later executed in 2010   As of May 2013  the Chinese banks  China Merchants Bank  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China  China Construction Bank  and Agricultural Bank of China  have stopped  all cross border cash transfers  regardless of the nature of the business  with North Korea  The Bank of China  the China s primary institution for foreign exchange transactions  said last week that  it had closed the account of Foreign Trade Bank  North Korea’s main foreign exchange bank   However   smaller bank based in northeastern China across the border from North Korea said it was still handling large scale cross border transfers   For example  the Bank of Dalian branch in Dandong is still doing transfers to North Korea   3 5  Retail  Until recently the official retail sector was mainly state controlled  under the direction of the People’s Services Committee  Consumer goods were few and of poor quality  with most provided on a ration basis  There were state run stores and direct factory outlets for the masses  and special shops with luxuries for the elite—as well as a chain of hard currency stores  a joint venture with the association of pro Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan  the Ch ongryŏn   with branches in large cities   3 6  Agriculture  North Korea s sparse agricultural resources limit agricultural production  Climate  terrain  and soil conditions are not particularly favorable for farming  with a relatively short cropping season  Only about 17% of the total landmass  or approximately   is arable  of which is well suited for cereal cultivation  the major portion of the country is rugged mountain terrain   The weather varies markedly according to elevation  and lack of precipitation  along with infertile soil  makes land at elevations higher than 400 meters unsuitable for purposes other than grazing  Precipitation is geographically and seasonally irregular  and in most parts of the country as much as half the annual rainfall occurs in the three summer months  This pattern favors the cultivation of paddy rice in warmer regions that are outfitted with irrigation and flood control networks  Rice yields are 5 3 tonnes per hectare  close to international norms  In 2005  North Korea was ranked by the FAO as an estimated 10th in the production of fresh fruit and as an estimated 19th in the production of apples   Farming is concentrated in the flatlands of the four west coast provinces  where a longer growing season  level land  adequate rainfall  and good irrigated soil permit the most intensive cultivation of crops  A narrow strip of similarly fertile land runs through the eastern seaboard Hamgyŏng provinces and Kangwŏn Province  but the interior provinces of Chagang and Ryanggang are too mountainous  cold  and dry to allow much farming  The mountains contain the bulk of North Korea s forest reserves while the foothills within and between the major agricultural regions provide lands for livestock grazing and fruit tree cultivation   Since self sufficiency remains an important pillar of North Korean ideology  self sufficiency in food production is deemed a worthy goal  Another aim of government policies—to reduce the  gap  between urban and rural living standards—requires continued investment in the agricultural sector  Finally  as in most countries  changes in the supply or prices of foodstuffs probably are the most conspicuous and sensitive economic concerns for the average citizen  The stability of the country depends on steady  if not rapid  increases in the availability of food items at reasonable prices  In the early 1990s  there was a severe food shortages   The most far reaching statement on agricultural policy is embodied in Kim Il Sung s 1964  Theses on the Socialist Agrarian Question in Our Country   which underscores the government s concern for agricultural development  Kim emphasized technological and educational progress in the countryside as well as collective forms of ownership and management  As industrialization progressed  the share of agriculture  forestry  and fisheries in the total national output declined from 63 5% and 31 4%  respectively  in 1945 and 1946  to a low of 26 8% in 1990  Their share in the labor force also declined from 57 6% in 1960 to 34 4% in 1989   In the 1990s  the decreasing ability to carry out mechanized operations  including the pumping of water for irrigation   as well as lack of chemical inputs  was clearly contributing to reduced yields and increased harvesting and post harvest losses   Incremental improvements in agricultural production have been made since the late 1990s  bringing North Korea close to self sufficiency in staple foods by 2013  In particular  rice yields have steadily improved  though yields on other crops have generally not improved  The production of protein foods remains inadequate  Access to chemical fertilizer has declined  but the use of compost and other organic fertilizer has been encouraged   3 6 1  Food distribution system  Since the 1950s  a majority of North Koreans have received their food through the public distribution system  PDS   The PDS requires farmers in agricultural regions to hand over a portion of their production to the government and then reallocates the surplus to urban regions  which cannot grow their own foods  About 70% of the North Korean population  including the entire urban population  receives food through this government run system   Before the floods  recipients were generally allotted 600 700 grams per day while high officials  military men  heavy laborers  and public security personnel were allotted slightly larger portions of 700 800 grams per day  As of 2013  the target average distribution was 573 grams of cereal equivalent per person per day  but varied according to age  occupation  and whether rations are received elsewhere  such as school meals    Decreases in production affected the quantity of food available through the public distribution system  Shortages were compounded when the North Korean government imposed further restrictions on collective farmers  When farmers  who had never been covered by the PDS  were mandated by the government to reduce their own food allotments from 167 kilograms to 107 kilograms of grain per person each year  they responded by withholding portions of the required amount of grain  Famine refugees reported that the government decreased PDS rations to 150 grams in 1994 and to as low as 30 grams by 1997  It was further reported that the PDS failed to provide any food from April to August 1998  the “lean” season  as well as from March to June 1999  In January 1998  the North Korean government publicly announced that the PDS would no longer distribute rations and that families needed to somehow procure their own food supplies  By 2005  the PDS was only supplying households with approximately one half of an absolute minimum caloric need  By 2008  the system had significantly recovered  and  from 2009 to 2013  daily per person rations averaged at 400 grams per day for much of the year  though in 2011 it dropped to 200 grams per day from May to September   It is estimated that in the early 2000s  the average North Korean family drew some 80% of its income from small businesses that were technically illegal  though unenforced  in North Korea  In 2002 and in 2010  private markets were progressively legalized  As of 2013  urban and farmer markets were held every 10 days  and most urban residents lived within 2 km of a market  with markets having an increasing role in obtaining food   3 6 2  Crisis and famine  From 1994 to 1998  North Korea suffered a famine  Since 1998 there has been a gradual recovery in agriculture production  which by 2013 brought North Korea back close to self sufficiency in staple foods  However  as of 2013  most households have borderline or poor food consumption  and consumption of protein remains inadequate   In the 1990s  the North Korean economy saw stagnation turning into crisis  Economic assistance received from the USSR and China was an important factor of its economic growth  In 1991 USSR collapsed  withdrew its support and demanded payment in hard currency for imports  China stepped in to provide some assistance and supplied food and oil  most of it reportedly at concessionary prices  But in 1994 China reduced its exports to North Korea  The rigidity in the political and economic systems of North Korea left the country ill prepared for a changing world  The North Korean economy was undermined and its industrial output began to decline in 1990  Deprived of industrial inputs  including fertilizers  pesticides  and electricity for irrigation  agricultural output also started to decrease even before North Korea had a series of natural disasters in the mid 1990s  This evolution  combined with a series of natural disasters including record floods in 1995  caused one of the worst economic crises in North Korea s history  Other causes of this crisis were high defense spending  about 25% of GDP  and bad governance  It is estimated that between 1992 and 1998 North Korea s economy contracted by 50% and several hundred thousand  possibly up to 3 million  people died of starvation   In December 1991  North Korea established a  zone of free economy and trade  to include the northeastern port cities of Unggi  Sŏnbong   Ch ŏngjin  and Najin  The establishment of this zone also had ramifications on the questions of how far North Korea would go in opening its economy to the West and to South Korea  the future of the development scheme for the Tumen River area  and  more important  how much North Korea would reform its economic system   North Korea announced in December 1993 a 3 year transitional economic policy placing primary emphasis on agriculture  light industry  and foreign trade  However  lack of fertilizer  natural disasters  and poor storage and transportation practices have left the country more than a million tons per year short of grain self sufficiency  Moreover  lack of foreign exchange to purchase spare parts and oil for electricity generation left many factories idle   The 1990s famine paralyzed many of the Marxist–Leninist economic institutions  The government pursued Kim Jong Il s Songun policy  under which the military is deployed to direct production and infrastructure projects  As a consequence of the government s policy of establishing economic self sufficiency  the North Korean economy has become increasingly isolated from that of the rest of the world  and its industrial development and structure do not reflect its international competitiveness  Domestic firms are shielded from international as well as domestic competition  the result is chronic inefficiency  poor quality  limited product diversity  and underutilization of plants  This protectionism also limits the size of the market for North Korean producers  which prevents taking advantage of economies of scale   3 6 3  Food shortages  The food shortage was caused as a direct result of the massive flooding and a mix of political failure and poor amounts of arable land in the country  In 2004  more than half  57%  of the population had not enough food for them to stay healthy  37% of the children had their growth stunted and 1 3 of mothers severely lacked nutrition   In 2006  the World Food Program  WFP  and FAO estimated a requirement of 5 3 to 6 5 million tons of grain when domestic production fulfilled only 3 825 million tons  The country also faces land degradation after forests stripped for agriculture resulted in soil erosion  Harsh weather conditions that dented the agricultural output  wheat and barley production dropped 50% and 80% respectively in 2011  and rising global food prices stressed greater food shortage  putting 6 million North Koreans at risk   In 2014 North Korea had an exceptionally good harvest  5 03 million tonnes of cereal equivalent  sufficient to feed the entire population   3 7  Mining  According to a 2012 report by South Korea based North Korea Resource Institute  NKRI   North Korea has substantial reserves of iron ore  coal  limestone  and magnesite  In addition  North Korea is thought to have tremendous potential rare metal resources  which have been valued in excess of US$6 trillion   It is the world s 18th largest producer of iron and zinc  having the 22nd largest coal reserves in the world  It is also the 15th largest fluorite producer and 12th largest producer of copper and salt in Asia  Other major natural resources in production include lead  tungsten  graphite  magnesite  gold  pyrites  fluorspar  and hydropower   3 8  Others  North Korea s cartoon animation industry sub contracts work from South Korean animation studios   4  Organization and management  North Korea s economy has been unique in its elimination of markets  By the 1960s  market elements had been suppressed almost completely  Almost all items  from food to clothes  have traditionally been handed out through a public distribution system  with money only having a symbolic meaning  Ratios of food depend on hierarchy in the system  wherein the positions seem to be semi hereditary  Until the late 1980s  peasants were not allowed to cultivate private garden plots   Since the government is the dominant force in the development and management of the economy  bureaus and departments have proliferated at all administrative levels  There are fifteen committees—such as the agricultural and state planning committees—one bureau  and twenty departments under the supervision of the State Administration Council  of these  twelve committees—one bureau  and sixteen departments are involved in economic management  In the early 1990s  several vice premiers of the State Administration Council supervised economic affairs  Organizations undergo frequent reorganization  Many of these agencies have their own separate branches at lower levels of government while others maintain control over subordinate sections in provincial and county administrative agencies   Around 1990  with the collapse of the Soviet Union  restrictions on private sales  including grain  ceased to be enforced  It is estimated that in the early 2000s  the average North Korean family drew some 80% of its income from small businesses that were technically illegal  though unenforced  in North Korea  In 2002  and in 2010  private markets were progressively legalized  As of 2013  urban and farmer markets were held every 10 days  and most urban residents lived within 2 km of a market   4 1  Economic planning  North Korea  one of the world s most centrally planned and isolated economies  faces desperate economic conditions  Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of years of underinvestment and shortages of spare parts  Industrial and power output have declined in parallel  During what North Korea called the  peaceful construction  period before the Korean War  the fundamental task of the economy was to overtake the level of output and efficiency attained toward the end of the Japanese occupation  to restructure and develop a viable economy reoriented toward the communist bloc countries  and to begin the process of socializing the economy  Nationalization of key industrial enterprises and land reform  both of which were carried out in 1946  laid the groundwork for two successive one year plans in 1947 and 1948  respectively  and the Two Year Plan of 1949 50  It was during this period that the piece rate wage system and the independent accounting system began to be applied and that the commercial network increasingly came under state and cooperative ownership   The basic goal of the Three Year Plan  officially named  The Three Year Post war Reconstruction Plan of 1954 56   was to reconstruct an economy torn by the Korean War  The plan stressed more than merely regaining the prewar output levels  The Soviet Union  other East European countries and China provided reconstruction assistance  The highest priority was developing heavy industry  but an earnest effort to collectivize farming also was begun  At the end of 1957  output of most industrial commodities had returned to 1949 levels  except for a few items such as chemical fertilizers  carbides  and sulfuric acid  whose recovery took longer   Having basically completed the task of reconstruction  the state planned to lay a solid foundation for industrialization while completing the socialization process and solving the basic problems of food and shelter during the Five Year Plan of 1957–60  The socialization process was completed by 1958 in all sectors of the economy  and the Ch ŏllima Movement was introduced  Although growth rates reportedly were high  there were serious imbalances among the different economic sectors  Because rewards were given to individuals and enterprises that met production quotas  frantic efforts to fulfill plan targets in competition with other enterprises and industries caused disproportionate growth among various enterprises  between industry and agriculture and between light and heavy industries  Because resources were limited and the transportation system suffered bottlenecks  resources were diverted to politically well connected enterprises or those whose managers complained the loudest  An enterprise or industry that performed better than others often did so at the expense of others  Such disruptions intensified as the target year of the plan approached   Until the 1960s  North Korea s economy grew much faster than South Korea s  Although P yongyang was behind in total national output  it was ahead of Seoul in per capita national output  because of its smaller population relative to South Korea  For example  in 1960 North Korea s population was slightly over 10 million persons  while South Korea s population was almost 25 million persons  Annual economic growth rates of 30% and 21% during the Three Year Plan of 1954 56 and the Five Year Plan of 1957 60  respectively  were reported  After claiming early fulfillment of the Five Year Plan in 1959  North Korea officially designated 1960 a  buffer year —a year of adjustment to restore balances among sectors before the next plan became effective in 1961  Not surprisingly the same phenomenon recurred in subsequent plans  Because the Five Year Plan was fulfilled early  it became a de facto four year plan  Beginning in the early 1960s  however  P yongyang s economic growth slowed until it was stagnant at the beginning of the 1990s   Various factors explain the very high rate of economic development of the country in the 1950s and the general slowdown since the 1960s  During the reconstruction period after the Korean War  there were opportunities for extensive economic growth—attainable through the communist regime s ability to marshall idle resources and labor and to impose a low rate of consumption  This general pattern of initially high growth resulting in a high rate of capital formation was mirrored in other Soviet type economies  Toward the end of the 1950s  as reconstruction work was completed and idle capacity began to diminish  the economy had to shift from the extensive to the intensive stage  where the simple communist discipline of marshaling underutilized resources became less effective  In the new stage  inefficiency arising from emerging bottlenecks led to diminishing returns  Further growth would only be attained by increasing efficiency and technological progress   Beginning in the early 1960s  a series of serious bottlenecks began to impede development  Bottlenecks were pervasive and generally were created by the lack of arable land  skilled labor  energy  and transportation  and deficiencies in the extractive industries  Moreover  both land and marine transportation lacked modern equipment and modes of transportation  The inability of the energy and extractive industries as well as of the transportation network to supply power and raw materials as rapidly as the manufacturing plants could absorb them began to slow industrial growth   The First Seven Year Plan  initially 1961 67  built on the groundwork of the earlier plans but changed the focus of industrialization  Heavy industry  with the machine tool industry as its linchpin  was given continuing priority  During the plan  however  the economy experienced widespread slowdowns and reverses for the first time  in sharp contrast to the rapid and uninterrupted growth during previous plans  Disappointing performance forced the planners to extend the plan three more years  until 1970  During the last part of the de facto ten year plan  emphasis shifted to pursuing parallel development of the economy and of defense capabilities  This shift was prompted by concern over the military takeover in South Korea by General Park Chung Hee  1961–79   escalation of the United States involvement in Vietnam  and the widening Sino Soviet split  It was thought that stimulating a technological revolution in the munitions industry was one means to achieve these parallel goals  In the end  the necessity to divert resources to defense became the official explanation for the plan s failure   The Six Year Plan of 1971 76 followed immediately in 1971  In the aftermath of the poor performance of the preceding plan  growth targets of the Six Year Plan were scaled down substantially  Because some of the proposed targets in the First Seven Year Plan had not been attained even by 1970  the Six Year Plan did not deviate much from its predecessor in basic goals  The Six Year Plan placed more emphasis on technological advance  self sufficiency  Juche  in industrial raw materials  improving product quality  correcting imbalances among different sectors  and developing the power and extractive industries  the last of these had been deemed largely responsible for slowdowns during the First Seven Year Plan  The plan called for attaining a self  sufficiency rate of 60 70% in all industrial sectors by substituting domestic raw materials wherever possible and by organizing and renovating technical processes to make the substitution feasible  Improving transport capacity was seen as one of the urgent tasks in accelerating economic development—it was one of the major bottlenecks of the Six Year Plan   North Korea claimed to have fulfilled the Six Year Plan by the end of August 1975  a full year and four months ahead of schedule  Under the circumstances  it was expected that the next plan would start without delay in 1976  a year early  as was the case when the First Seven Year Plan was instituted in 1961  Even if the Six Year Plan had been completed on schedule  the next plan should have started in 1977  However  it was not until nearly two years and four months later that the long awaited plan was unveiled—1977 had become a  buffer year    The inability of the planners to continuously formulate and institute economic plans reveals as much about the inefficacy of planning itself as the extent of the economic difficulties and administrative disruptions facing the country  For example  targets for successive plans have to be based on the accomplishments of preceding plans  If these targets are underfulfilled  all targets of the next plan—initially based on satisfaction of the plan—have to be reformulated and adjusted  Aside from underfulfillment of the targets  widespread disruptions and imbalances among various sectors of the economy further complicate plan formulation   The basic thrust of the Second Seven Year Plan  1978–84  was to achieve the three pronged goals of self reliance  modernization  and  scientification   Although the emphasis on self reliance was not new  it had not previously been the explicit focus of an economic plan  This new emphasis might have been a reaction to mounting foreign debt originating from large scale imports of Western machinery and equipment in the mid  1970s  Through modernization North Korea hoped to increase mechanization and automation in all sectors of the economy   Scientification  means the adoption of up to date production and management techniques  The specific objectives of the economic plan were to strengthen the fuel  energy  and resource bases of industry through priority development of the energy and extractive industries  to modernize industry  to substitute domestic resources for certain imported raw materials  to expand freight carrying capacity in railroad  road  and marine transportation systems  to centralize and containerize the transportation system  and to accelerate a technical revolution in agriculture   In order to meet the manpower and technology requirements of an expanding economy  the education sector also was targeted for improvements  The quality of the comprehensive eleven year compulsory education system was to be enhanced to train more technicians and specialists  and to expand the training of specialists  particularly in the fields of fuel  mechanical  electronic  and automation engineering   Successful fulfillment of the so called nature remaking projects also was part of the Second Seven Year Plan  These projects referred to the five point program for nature transformation unveiled by Kim Il Sung in 1976  completing the irrigation of non paddy fields  reclaiming 1 000 square kilometres of new land  building 1 500 to 2 000 km² of terraced fields  carrying out afforestation and water conservation work  and reclaiming tidal land   From all indications  the Second Seven Year Plan was not successful  North Korea generally downplayed the accomplishments of the plan  and no other plan received less official fanfare  It was officially claimed that the economy had grown at an annual rate of 8 8% during the plan  somewhat below the planned rate of 9 6%  The reliability of this aggregate measure  however  is questionable  During the plan  the target annual output of 10 million tons of grains  cereals and pulses  was attained  However  by official admission  the targets of only five other commodities were fulfilled  Judging from the growth rates announced for some twelve industrial products  it is highly unlikely that the total industrial output increased at an average rate of 12 2% as claimed  After the plan concluded  there was no new economic plan for two years  indications of both the plan s failure and the severity of the economic and planning problems confronting the economy in the mid 1980s  From 1998 to 2003  the government implemented a plan for scientific and technical development  which focused on the nation s IT and electronic industry   5  Labor  Growth and changes in the structure and ownership pattern of the economy also have changed the labor force  By 1958 individual private farmers  who once constituted more than 70% of the labor force  had been transformed into or replaced by state or collective farmers  Private artisans  merchants  and entrepreneurs had joined state or cooperative enterprises  In the industrial sector in 1963  the last year for which such data are available  there were 2 295 state enterprises and 642 cooperative enterprises  The size and importance of the state enterprises can be surmised by the fact that state enterprises  which constituted 78% of the total number of industrial enterprises  contributed 91% of total industrial output   Labor force  20 million    by occupation   Agricultural  37%  Industry and services  63%  6  External trade  Statistics from North Korea s trade partners is collected by international organizations like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund  and by South Korean organizations such as the National Unification Board   It is also estimated that imports of arms from the USSR in the period 1988 to 1990 accounted for around 30% of the DPRK s total imports  and that between 1981 and 1989 the DPRK earned approximately $4 billion from the export of arms  approximately 30% of the DPRK s total exports in that period  The nominal dollar value of arms exports from the DPRK in 1996 is estimated to have been around $50 million   North Korea’s foreign trade deteriorated in the 1990s  After hitting the bottom of $1 4 billion in 1998  it recovered slightly  North Korea’s trade total in 2002 was $2 7 billion  only about 50% of $5 2 billion in 1988  even in nominal US dollars  These figures exclude intra Korean trade  deemed internal  which rose in 2002 to $641 million  During the late 2000s trade grew strongly  almost tripling between 2007 and 2011 to $5 6 billion  with much of the growth being with China   In addition to Kaesŏng and Kŭmgang san  other special economic areas have been established at Sinŭiju in the northwest  on the border with China   and at Rasŏn in the northeast  on the border with China and Russia    International sanctions have impeded international trade to some degree  many related to North Korea s development of weapons of mass destruction  President Obama approved a new executive order in April 2011 that declares “the importation into the United States  directly or indirectly  of any goods  services  or technology from North Korea is prohibited ” Operational sanctions include   United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1928  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2087  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094 The Taep oong International Investment Group of Korea is the official company that manages oversea investments to North Korea   6 1  North South economic ties  North and South Korea s economic ties have fluctuated greatly over the past 30 years or so  In the late 1990s and most of the 2000s  North South relations warmed under the Sunshine Policy of President Kim Dae Jung  Many firms have agreed to invest in North Korea  encouraged by the South Korean government s commitment to cover their losses  should investment projects in the north fail to become profitable   Following a 1988 decision by the South Korean Government to allow trade with the North  see Reunification efforts since 1971   South Korean firms began to import North Korean goods  Direct trade with the South began in the fall of 1990 after the unprecedented September 1990 meeting of the two Korean Prime Ministers  Trade between the countries increased from $18 8 million in 1989 to $333 4 million in 1999  much of it processing or assembly work undertaken in the North   During this decade  the chairman of the South Korean company Daewoo visited North Korea and reached agreement on building a light industrial complex at Namp o  In other negotiations  Hyundai Asan obtained permission to bring tour groups by sea to Kŭmgang san on the North Korea s southeast coast  see Kŭmgang san Tourist Region   and more recently to construct the Kaesŏng Industrial Park  near the Demilitarized Zone  DMZ   at a cost of more than $1 billion   In response to the summit between Kim Jong il and Kim Dae jung in 2000  North and South Korea agreed in August 2000 to reconnect the section of the Seoul P yŏngyang Gyeongui Railway Line across the DMZ  In addition  the two governments said they would build a four lane highway bypassing the truce village at P anmunjŏm  Once these projects are complete  the Kaesŏng industrial park will have ready access to South Korean markets and ports   TV commercials for Samsung’s Anycall cell phone featuring North Korean dancer Cho Myong ae and South Korea’s Lee Hyo ri were first broadcast on June 11  2006   Trade with South Korea declined after Lee Myung bak was elected President of South Korea in 2008  who reduced trade to put pressure on North Korea over nuclear matters  Trade with South Korea fell from $1 8 billion to $1 1 billion between 2007 and 2013  most of the remaining trade being through the Kaesŏng Industrial Park   6 2
