Plot  The film opens with a flashback to Gracie Hart s childhood  Gracie  Mary Ashleigh Green  is in a school playground where one boy is bullying another  She steps in and beats up the bully to help the victim  a boy she likes   But instead of being grateful  he feels humiliated at being rescued  by a girl   and gets angry at her  She promptly punches him in the nose and then sulks alone in the playground   Fast forward to the present day  and Gracie Hart  Sandra Bullock  is an FBI Special Agent  In the middle of a sting operation  the target starts to choke on some food  and Gracie disobeys her superior s command in order to stop the target from choking  As a result  a member of her squad gets shot  and she is reprimanded by being reassigned to a desk job   Soon afterwards  the bureau learns that there has been a bomb threat against the 75th annual Miss United States beauty pageant in San Antonio  Texas  which the bureau determines came from the notorious domestic terrorist known as  The Citizen   Gracie s partner  Special Agent Eric Matthews  Benjamin Bratt   is chosen to lead the mission to stop the attack  Despite Eric s position as the lead agent in charge  it is apparent that Gracie is the more capable agent  as Eric is unsure of how to proceed and takes credit for Gracie s suggestions  One of Gracie s suggestions is to put an agent undercover at the pageant  Gracie s male colleagues then proceed to have a bit of fun running the digital images of female agents through a website meant for children to play dress up with their dolls  Despite the immature and chauvinistic actions of the agents  Eric recognizes that Gracie is the female FBI agent best qualified for the undercover job   Beauty pageant coach Victor Melling  Michael Caine   whose reputation was ruined after his last contestant criticized his methods  teaches the tomboyish Gracie how to dress  walk  and act like a contestant  She is not used to such behavior  however  and sees the pageant and its participants as  outdated and antifeminist   Eventually though Victor and Gracie come to respect each other s strengths  Representing New Jersey as  Gracie Lou Freebush   Gracie impresses the audience by playing the glass harp and demonstrating self defense techniques during the talent competition  She also unexpectedly becomes friends with the other contestants   Several suspects emerge  including the corrupt competition director and former pageant winner Kathy Morningside  Candice Bergen   her unpleasant assistant Frank Tobin  Steve Monroe   the veteran pageant MC Stan Fields  William Shatner  who  like Kathy  is being replaced with a younger person  and Miss Rhode Island—Cheryl Frasier  Heather Burns   who appears to have a history as a radical animal rights activist  The Citizen is arrested elsewhere on an unrelated charge  Gracie begins to suspect Kathy Morningside and is worried about the safety of the girls  Her boss thinks that her suspicions are groundless and that the pageant is out of danger now that the Citizen has been arrested  He calls off the mission  But Gracie opts to turn in her badge and gun and continue the investigation alone  Eric initially fails to support Gracie  and is about to return to the bureau when he figures out that Gracie s suspicions must be correct  and returns to help her   In the final round of the pageant  Gracie earns second place while Cheryl becomes Miss United States  Gracie realizes that Kathy Morningside and Frank Tobin—who unbeknownst to anyone is Kathy s son—impersonated the Citizen and made the threat  Because she was going to be fired after the pageant was over  Kathy and her son were planning to murder the newly crowned pageant winner on stage by putting an explosive device in her tiara  However  Gracie and Eric save the day and arrest Kathy and her son  Gracie s fellow contestants choose her as  Miss Congeniality   and  as the story ends  a romance blooms between Gracie and Eric   2  Cast
