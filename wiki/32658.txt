 lead  zinc  salt  sulfur  magnesite  kaolin and small amounts of oil and natural gas  The recently made available US Department of Energy report revealed that the largest reserves of shale gas in Europe are in Poland and it is expected that its production will play an important role in the Polish economy in the near future   Poland has been called the bread basket of Europe due to its highly
