Pharaoh    or   is the common title of the kings of Ancient Egyptian dynasties until the Graeco Roman conquest   1  Title origin  The title originates in the Egyptian term pr ˤ3  literally  great house   describing the royal palace  Historically  however   pharaoh  only started being used as a title for the king during the New Kingdom  specifically during the middle of the eighteenth dynasty  after the reign of Hatshepsut   2  Etymology  Pharaoh  meaning  Great House   originally referred to the king s palace  but during the reign of Thutmose III  ca  1479–1425 BC  in the New Kingdom  after the foreign rule of the Hyksos during the Second Intermediate Period  became the form of address for a person who was king and the son of the god Ra   The Egyptian sun god Ra  considered the father of all pharaohs  was said to have created himself from a pyramid shaped mound of earth before creating all other gods    Donald B  Redford  Ph D   Penn State   The term pharaoh ultimately was derived from a compound word represented as   written with the two biliteral hieroglyphs  house  and  column   It was used only in larger phrases such as smr pr aa  Courtier of the High House   with specific reference to the buildings of the court or palace  From the twelfth dynasty onward the word appears in a wish formula  Great House  may it live  prosper  and be in health   but again only with reference to the royal palace and not the person   The earliest instance where pr aa is used specifically to address the ruler is in a letter to Amenhotep IV  Akhenaten   who reigned c  1353–1336 BC  which is addressed to  Pharaoh  all life  prosperity  and health   During the eighteenth dynasty  sixteenth to fourteenth centuries BC  the title pharaoh was employed as a reverential designation of the ruler  About the late twenty first dynasty  tenth century BC   however  instead of being used alone as before  it began to be added to the other titles before the ruler s name  and from the twenty fifth dynasty  eighth to seventh centuries BC  it was  at least in ordinary usage  the only epithet prefixed to the royal appellative   From the nineteenth dynasty onward pr ꜥꜣ on its own was used as regularly as hm f   Majesty   The term therefore evolved from a word specifically referring to a building to a respectful designation for the ruler  particularly by the twenty second dynasty and twenty third dynasty   For instance  the first dated instance of the title pharaoh being attached to a ruler s name occurs in Year 17 of Siamun on a fragment from the Karnak Priestly Annals  Here  an induction of an individual to the Amun priesthood is dated specifically to the reign of Pharaoh Siamun  This new practice was continued under his successor Psusennes II and the twenty first dynasty kings  Meanwhile the old custom of referring to the sovereign simply as pr aa continued in traditional Egyptian narratives   By this time  the Late Egyptian word is reconstructed to have been pronounced whence comes Ancient Greek and then Late Latin   From the latter  English obtained the word  Pharaoh   In the Hebrew Bible  the title also occurs as  פרעה   Over time  evolved into Sahidic Coptic prro and then rro  by mistaking p  as the definite article prefix  the  from Ancient Egyptian pꜣ    3  Regalia  3 1  Scepters and staves  Scepters and staves were a general sign of authority in Ancient Egypt  One of the earliest royal scepters was discovered in the tomb of Khasekhemwy in Abydos  Kings were also known to carry a staff  and Pharaoh Anedjib is shown on stone vessels carrying a so called mks staff  The scepter with the longest history seems to be the heqa scepter  sometimes described as the shepherd s crook  The earliest examples of this piece of regalia dates to pre dynastic times  A scepter was found in a tomb at Abydos that dates to the late Naqada period   Another scepter associated with the king is the was scepter  This is a long staff mounted with an animal head  The earliest known depictions of the was scepter date to the first dynasty  The was scepter is shown in the hands of both kings and deities   The flail later was closely related to the heqa scepter  the crook and flail   but in early representations the king was also depicted solely with the flail  as shown in a late pre dynastic knife handle which is now in the Metropolitan museum  and on the Narmer Macehead   3 2  The Uraeus  The earliest evidence we have of the use of the Uraeus—a rearing cobra—is from the reign of Den from the first dynasty  The cobra supposedly protected the pharaoh by spitting fire at its enemies   4  Crowns and headdresses  The red crown of Lower Egypt – the Deshret crown – dates back to pre dynastic times  A red crown has been found on a pottery shard from Naqada  and later  king Narmer is shown wearing the red crown on both the Narmer macehead and the Narmer palette   The white crown of Upper Egypt – the Hedjet crown – is shown on the Qustul incense burner which dates to the pre dynastic period  Later  King Scorpion was depicted wearing the white crown  as was Narmer   The combination of red and white crown into the double crown – or Pschent crown – is first documented in the middle of the first dynasty  The earliest depiction may date to the reign of Djet  and is otherwise surely attested during the reign of Den   4 1  Khat and nemes headdresses  The khat headdress consists of a kind of “kerchief” whose end is tied similarly to a ponytail  The earliest depictions of the khat headdress comes from the reign of Den  but is not found again until the reign of Djoser   The Nemes headdress dates from the time of Djoser  The statue from his Serdab in Saqqara shows the king wearing the nemes headdress   4 2  Physical evidence  Egyptologist Bob Brier has noted that despite its widespread depiction in royal portraits  no ancient Egyptian crown ever has been discovered  Tutankhamun s tomb  discovered largely intact  did contain such regalia as his crook and flail  but no crown was found however among the funerary equipment  Diadems have been discovered   It is presumed that crowns would have been believed to have magical properties  Brier s speculation is that crowns were religious or state items  so it is likely that a dead pharaoh could not retain a crown as a personal possession  The crowns may have been passed along to the successor   5  Titles  During the early dynastic period kings had as many as three titles  The Horus name is the oldest and dates to the late pre dynastic period  The Nesw Bity name was added during the first dynasty  The Nebty name was first introduced toward the end of the first dynasty  The Golden falcon  bik nbw  name is not well understood  The prenomen and nomen were introduced later and are traditionally enclosed in a cartouche  By the Middle Kingdom  the official titulary of the ruler consisted of five names  Horus  nebty  golden Horus  nomen  and prenomen for some rulers  only one or two of them may be known   5 1  Nesw Bity name  The Nesw Bity name was one of the new developments from the reign of Den  The name would follow the glyphs for the “Sedge and the Bee”  The title is usually translated as king of Upper and Lower Egypt  The nsw bity name may have been the birth name of the king  It was often the name by which kings were recorded in the later annals and king lists   5 2  Horus name  The Horus name was adopted by the king  when taking the throne  The name was written within a square frame representing the palace  named a serekh  The earliest known example of a serekh dates to the reign of king Ka  before the first dynasty  The Horus name of several early kings expresses a relationship with Horus  Aha refers to “Horus the fighter”  Djer refers to “Horus the strong”  etc  Later kings express ideals of kingship in their Horus names  Khasekhemwy refers to “Horus  the two powers are at peace”  while Nebra refers to “Horus  Lord of the Sun”   5 3  Nebty name  The earliest example of a nebty name comes from the reign of king Aha from the first dynasty  The title links the king with the goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt Nekhbet and Wadjet  The title is preceded by the vulture  Nekhbet  and the cobra  Wadjet  standing on a basket  the neb sign    5 4  Golden Horus  The Golden Horus or Golden Falcon name was preceded by a falcon on a gold or nbw sign  The title may have represented the divine status of the king  The Horus associated with gold may be referring to the idea that the bodies of the deities were made of gold and the pyramids and obelisks are representations of  golden  sun rays  The gold sign may also be a reference to Nubt  the city of Set  This would suggest that the iconography represents Horus conquering Set   5 5  Nomen and prenomen  The prenomen and nomen were contained in a cartouche  The prenomen often followed the King of Upper and Lower Egypt  nsw bity  or Lord of the Two Lands  nebtawy  title  The prenomen often incorporated the name of Re  The nomen often followed the title Son of Re  sa ra  or the title Lord of Appearances  neb kha’    6  See also  List of pharaohs
