A learning object is  a collection of content items  practice items  and assessment items that are combined based on a single learning objective   The term is credited to Wayne Hodgins when he created a working group in 1994 bearing the name though the concept was first described by Gerard in 1967  Learning objects go by many names  including content objects  chunks  educational objects  information objects  intelligent objects  knowledge bits  knowledge objects  learning components  media objects  reusable curriculum components  nuggets  reusable information objects  reusable learning objects  testable reusable units of cognition  training components  and units of learning   Learning objects offer a new conceptualization of the learning process  rather than the traditional  several hour chunk   they provide smaller  self contained  re usable units of learning   They will typically have a number of different components  which range from descriptive data to information about rights and educational level  At their core  however  will be instructional content  practice  and assessment  A key issue is the use of metadata   Learning object design raises issues of portability  and of the object s relation to a broader learning management system   1  Definitions  The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE  defines a learning object as  any entity  digital or non digital  that may be used for learning  education or training    Chiappe defined Learning Objects as   A digital self contained and reusable entity  with a clear educational purpose  with at least three internal and editable components  content  learning activities and elements of context  The learning objects must have an external structure of information to facilitate their identification  storage and retrieval  the metadata    The following definitions focus on the relation between learning object and digital media  RLO CETL  a British inter university Learning Objects Center  defines  reusable learning objects  as  web based interactive chunks of e learning designed to explain a stand alone learning objective   Daniel Rehak and Robin Mason define it as  a digitized entity which can be used  reused or referenced during technology supported learning    Adapting a definition from the Wisconsin Online Resource Center  Robert J  Beck suggests that learning objects have the following key characteristics   Learning objects are a new way of thinking about learning content  Traditionally  content comes in a several hour chunk  Learning objects are much smaller units of learning  typically ranging from 2 minutes to 15 minutes   Are self contained – each learning object can be taken independently  Are reusable – a single learning object may be used in multiple contexts for multiple purposes  Can be aggregated – learning objects can be grouped into larger collections of content  including traditional course structures  Are tagged with metadata – every learning object has descriptive information allowing it to be easily found by a search  2  Components  The following is a list of some of the types of information that may be included in a learning object and its metadata   General Course Descriptive Data  including  course identifiers  language of content  English  Spanish  etc    subject area  Maths  Reading  etc    descriptive text  descriptive keywords  Life Cycle  including  version  status  Instructional Content  including  text  web pages  images  sound  video  Glossary of Terms  including  terms  definition  acronyms  Quizzes and Assessments  including  questions  answers  Rights  including  cost  copyrights  restrictions on Use  Relationships to Other Courses  including prerequisite courses  Educational Level  including  grade level  age range  typical learning time  and difficulty   IEEE 1484 12 1 2002   Typology as defined by Churchill  2007   presentation  practice  simulation  conceptual models  information  and contextual representation  3  Metadata  One of the key issues in using learning objects is their identification by search engines or content management systems  This is usually facilitated by assigning descriptive learning object metadata  Just as a book in a library has a record in the card catalog  learning objects must also be tagged with metadata  The most important pieces of metadata typically associated with a learning object include   objective  The educational objective the learning object is instructing  prerequisites  The list of skills  typically represented as objectives  which the learner must know before viewing the learning object  topic  Typically represented in a taxonomy  the topic the learning object is instructing  interactivity  The Interaction Model of the learning object   technology requirements  The required system requirements to view the learning object   4  Mutability  A mutated learning object is  according to Michael Shaw  a learning object that has been  re purposed and or re engineered  changed or simply re used in some way different from its original intended design   Shaw also introduces the term  contextual learning object   to describe a learning object that has been  designed to have specific meaning and purpose to an intended learner    5  Portability  Before any institution invests a great deal of time and energy into building high quality e learning content  which can cost over $10 000 per classroom hour   it needs to consider how this content can be easily loaded into a Learning Management System  It is possible for example  to package learning objects with SCORM specification and load it in Moodle Learning Management System or Desire2Learn Learning Environment   If all of the properties of a course can be precisely defined in a common format  the content can be serialized into a standard format such as XML and loaded into other systems  When it is considered that some e learning courses need to include video  mathematical equations using MathML  chemistry equations using CML and other complex structures  the issues become very complex  especially if the systems needs to understand and validate each structure and then place it correctly in a database   6  Criticism  In 2001  David Wiley criticized learning object theory in his paper  which is as  If a learning object is useful in a particular context  by definition it is not reusable in a different context  If a learning object is reusable in many contexts  it isn’t particularly useful in any  In   Norm Friesen  Canada Research Chair in E Learning Practices at Thompson Rivers University  points out that the word neutrality in itself implies a state or position that is antithetical     to pedagogy and teaching   7  See also  Intelligent tutoring system  North Carolina Learning Object Repository  NCLOR   Serious games  8  References  9  Further reading           Spanish Draf           Churchill  D
