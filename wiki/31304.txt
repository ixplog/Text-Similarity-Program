The Type II U boat was designed by Germany as a coastal U boat  modeled after the CV 707 submarine  which was designed by the Dutch dummy company NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw den Haag  I v S   set up by Germany after World War I in order to maintain and develop German submarine technology and to circumvent the limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles  and built in 1933 by the Finnish Crichton Vulcan shipyard in Turku  Finland  It was too small to undertake sustained operations far away from the home support facilities  Its primary role was found to be in the training schools  preparing new German naval officers for command  It appeared in four sub types   1  Background  Germany was stripped of her U boats by the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I  but in the late 1920s and early 1930s began to rebuild her armed forces  The pace of rearmament accelerated under Adolf Hitler  and the first Type II U boat was laid down on 11 February 1935  Knowing that the world would see this step towards rearmament  Hitler reached an agreement with Britain to build a navy up to 35% of the size of the Royal Navy in surface vessels  but equal to the British in number of submarines  This agreement was signed on 18 June 1935  and was commissioned 11 days later   2  Design  The defining characteristic of the Type II was its tiny size  Known as the Einbaum   dugout canoe    it had the advantages over larger boats of the ability to work in shallow water  diving more quickly  and being more difficult to spot due to the low conning tower  However  it had a shallower maximum depth  short range  and cramped living conditions  and could carry few torpedoes   The boat had a single hull  with no watertight compartments  There were three torpedo tubes forward  none aft   with space for another two torpedoes inside the pressure hull for reloads  A single 20 mm anti aircraft gun was provided  but no deck gun was mounted   Space inside was limited  The two spare torpedoes extended from just behind the torpedo tubes to just in front of the control room  and most of the 24 man crew lived in this forward area around the torpedoes  sharing 12 bunks  Four bunks were also provided aft of the engines for the engine room crew  Cooking and sanitary facilities were basic  and in this environment long patrols were very arduous   Most Type IIs only saw operational service during the early years of the war  thereafter remaining in training bases  Six were stripped down to just a hull  transported by river and truck to Linz  on the Danube   and reassembled for use in the Black Sea against the Soviet Union   In contrast to other German submarine types  few Type IIs were lost  This  of course  reflects their use as training boats  although accidents accounted for several vessels   These boats were a first step towards re armament  intended to provide Germany with experience in submarine construction and operation and lay the foundation for larger boats to build upon  Only one of these submarines survives to this day  the prototype CV 707  renamed Vesikko by the Finnish Navy which later bought it   On February 3  2008  The Telegraph reported that U 20 had been discovered by Selçuk Kolay  a Turkish marine engineer in of water off the coast of the Turkish city of Zonguldak  The paper also reported that Kolay knows where U 23 and U 19 are  scuttled in deeper water near U 20   3  Comparison of Finnish Crichton Vulcan CV 707 U2A  to German Type II  4  Type IIA  The Type IIA was a single hull  all welded boat with internal ballast tanks  Compared to the other variants  it had a smaller bridge and could carry the German G7a  G7e torpedoes as well as TM type torpedo mines  There was a single periscope in the conning tower with serrated net cutters in the bow  The net cutters were adopted from World War 1 boats but were quickly discontinued during World War 2   Deutsche Werke AG  of Kiel built six Type IIAs in 1934 and 1935   4 1  List of Type IIA submarines  5  Type IIB  The Type IIB was a lengthened version of the Type IIA  Three additional compartments were inserted amidships which were fitted with additional diesel tanks beneath the control room  The range was increased to 1 800 nautical miles at 12 knots  Diving time was also improved to 30 seconds   Deutsche Werke AG  of Kiel  built four Type IIBs in 1935 and 1936  Germaniawerft AG  of Kiel  built fourteen in 1935 and 1936  and Flender Werke AG  of Lübeck  built two between 1938 and 1940  for a total of twenty built   5 1  List of Type IIB submarines  There were 20 Type IIB submarines commissioned   6  Type IIC  The Type IIC was a further lengthened version of the Type IIB with an additional two compartments inserted amidships to accommodate improved radio room facilities and a second periscope  The additional diesel tanks beneath the control room was further enlarged  extending the range to 1 900 nautical miles at 12 knots   Deutsche Werke AG  of Kiel built eight Type IICs between 1937 and 1940   6 1  List of Type IIC submarines  There were eight Type IIC submarines commissioned  7  Type IID  The Type IID had additional saddle tanks fitted to the sides of the external hull  These saddle tanks were used to accommodate additional diesel storage tanks  The diesel oil would float atop the saddle tanks and as the oil is consumed  sea water would gradually fill the tanks to compensate for the positive buoyancy  The range was nearly doubled to 3 450 nautical miles at 12 knots and enabled the Type II to operate around the British Isles  A further development was the propellers were fitted with Kurt nozzles  intended to improve propulsion efficiency   Deutsche Werke AG  of Kiel built sixteen Type IIDs in 1939 and 1940   7 1  List of Type IID submarines  There were 16 Type IID submarines commissioned  8  Ships in class  See list of German Type II submarines for individual ship details  9  See also  List of naval ship classes of
