The Mississippian  also known as Lower Carboniferous or Early Carboniferous  is a subperiod in the geologic timescale or a subsystem of the geologic record  It is the earliest lowermost of two subperiods of the Carboniferous period lasting from roughly to million years ago  As with most other geochronologic units  the rock beds that define the Mississippian are well identified  but the exact start and end dates are uncertain by a few million years  The Mississippian is so named because rocks with this age are exposed in the Mississippi River valley   The Mississippian was a period of marine ingression in the Northern Hemisphere  the ocean stood so high only the Fennoscandian Shield and the Laurentian Shield stood above sea level  The cratons were surrounded by extensive delta systems and lagoons  and carbonate sedimentation on the surrounding continental platforms  covered by shallow seas   In North America  where the interval consists primarily of marine limestones  it is treated as a geologic period between the Devonian and the Pennsylvanian  During the Mississippian an important phase of orogeny occurred in the Appalachian Mountains  It is a major rock building period named for the exposures in the Mississippi Valley region  The USGS geologic time scale shows its relation to other periods   In Europe  the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are one more or less continuous sequence of lowland continental deposits and are grouped together as the Carboniferous system  and sometimes called the Upper Carboniferous and Lower Carboniferous instead   1  Subdivisions  In the official geologic timescale  the Mississippian is subdivided into three stages   Serpukhovian   to mya   Visean   to mya   Tournaisian   to mya  The first two come from European stratigraphy  the last is from Russian stratigraphy  Besides Europe and Russia  there are many local subdivisions that are used as alternatives for the international timescale  In the North American system  the Mississippian is subdivided into four stages   Chesterian  top of the Visean plus the Serpukhovian   Meramecian  middle Visean   Osagean  top of the Tournaisian and bottom of the Visean   Kinderhookian  the lower two thirds of the Tournaisian   2  References  3  External links
