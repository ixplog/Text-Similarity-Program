Khyber Pakhtunkhwa       formerly called North West Frontier Province  is one of the four provinces of Pakistan  It borders the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to the west and south  Gilgit–Baltistan to the north east  Azad Kashmir to the east  Punjab and the Islamabad Capital Territory to the south east  and Afghanistan to the north west  The province of Balochistan is located southwards  The provincial capital and largest city is Peshawar   1  History  Before independence from Britain  the North West Frontier Province voted to join Pakistan in a referendum held on 2July 1947  50 1% of the registered voters only 15% less than that in 1946 elections  exercised their vote and majority  99 02%  of them voted for Pakistan  There was no option in the polls to vote to become a sovereign state independent of India and Pakistan  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and his Khudai Khidmatgars boycotted the polls with other nationalistic or pro India Pashtuns  Some have argued that a segment of the population was barred from voting   Afghanistan claims the Pashtun dominated western areas of the territory as its own  After the independence of Pakistan in 1947  Afghanistan was the only country to vote against Pakistan’s accession to the United Nations  because of Kabul’s claim on the Pashtun territories on the Pakistani side of the Durand Line  The population of this region as per the 1901 Census of the North West Frontier Province was 2 125 480  out of which Muslims were 1 957 777  Hindus were 134 252 and Sikhs were 28 091   1 1  Independence and Durand Line dispute  Afghanistan s Loya Jirga of 1949 declared the Durand Line invalid  which led to border tensions with Pakistan  Afghan governments have periodically refused to recognize Pakistan s inheritance of British treaties regarding the region  During the 1950s  Afghanistan supported the secessionist Pushtunistan Movement that failed to gain substantial support amongst the tribes of the North West Frontier Province  Afghanistan s refusal to recognize the Durrand Line and its subsequent support for the Pashtunistan Movement has been cited as the main cause of tensions between the two countries that have existed since Pakistan s independence  After Ayub Khan eliminated Pakistan s provinces  Yahya Khan  in 1969  abolished this  one unit  scheme and added Princely States of Amb  Swat  Dir and  Chitral to the new North West Frontier Province as the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas   1 2  Afghan War  During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan  1979–1989   the North West Frontier Province served as a major supply base for the Mujahideen who fought the Soviets during the 1980s  Following the arrival of Soviet forces  over five million Afghan refugees poured into Pakistan  most residing in the North West Frontier Province    nearly 3 million remained   The province remained heavily influenced by events in Afghanistan  Civil war in Afghanistan  1989–1992  led to the rise of the Taliban  which had emerged in the border region between Afghanistan  Balochistan  PATA and FATA as a formidable political force  Following the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001  the FATA and bordering North West Frontier Province became a front line region again  as part of the global  War on Terror    1 3  Name change  In 2010 the name of the province was changed to  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa   Protests arose among the local Hindkowan  Chitrali  Kohistani and Kalash populations over the name change  as they began to demand their own provinces  Seven people were killed and 100 injured in protests on 11April 2011  The Awami National Party sought to rename the province  Pakhtunkhwa   which translates to  Land of Pakhtuns  in the Pashto language  This was opposed by some of the non Pashtuns  and especially by parties such as the Pakistan Muslim League N  PML N  and Muttahida Majlis e Amal  MMA   The PML N derives its support in the province from primarily non Pashtun Hazara regions   2  Geography  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sits primarily on the Iranian plateau and comprises the junction where the slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains on the Eurasian plate give way to the Indus watered hills approaching South Asia  This situation has led to seismic activity in the past  The famous Khyber Pass links the province to Afghanistan  while the Kohalla Bridge in Circle Bakote Abbottabad is a major crossing point over the Jhelum River in the east   Geographically the province could be divided into two zones  the northern one extending from the ranges of the Hindu Kush to the borders of Peshawar basin and the southern one extending from Peshawar to the Derajat basin   The northern zone is cold and snowy in winters with heavy rainfall and pleasant summers with the exception of Peshawar basin  which is hot in summer and cold in winter  It has moderate rainfall  The southern zone is arid with hot summers and relatively cold winters and scanty rainfall   The major rivers that criss cross the province are the Kabul  Swat  Chitral  Kunar  Siran  Panjkora  Bara  Kurram  Dor  Haroo  Gomal and Zhob   Its snow capped peaks and lush green valleys of unusual beauty have enormous potential for tourism   2 1  Climate  The climate of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa varies immensely for a region of its size  encompassing most of the many climate types found in Pakistan  The province stretching southwards from the Baroghil Pass in the Hindu Kush covers almost six degrees of latitude  it is mainly a mountainous region  Dera Ismail Khan is one of the hottest places in South Asia while in the mountains to the north the weather is temperate in the summer and intensely cold in the winter  The air is generally very dry  consequently  the daily and annual range of temperature is quite large   Rainfall also varies widely  Although large parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are typically dry  the province also contains the wettest parts of Pakistan in its eastern fringe   2 1 1  Chitral District  Chitral District lies completely sheltered from the monsoon that controls the weather in eastern Pakistan  owing to its relatively westerly location and the shielding effect of the Nanga Parbat massif  In many ways Chitral District has more in common regarding climate with Central Asia than South Asia  The winters are generally cold even in the valleys  and heavy snow during the winter blocks passes and isolates the region  In the valleys  however  summers can be hotter than on the windward side of the mountains due to lower cloud cover  Chitral can reach frequently during this period  However  the humidity is extremely low during these hot spells and  as a result the summer climate is less torrid than in the rest of the Indian subcontinent   Most precipitation falls as thunderstorms or snow during winter and spring  so that the climate at the lowest elevations is classed as Mediterranean  Csa   continental Mediterranean  Dsa  or semi arid  BSk   Summers are extremely dry in the north of Chitral district and receive only a little rain in the south around Drosh   At elevations above   as much as a third of the snow which feeds the large Karakoram and Hindukush glaciers comes from the monsoon since these elevations are too high to be shielded from its moisture   2 1 2  Central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  On the southern flanks of Nanga Parbat and in Upper and Lower Dir Districts  rainfall is much heavier than further north because moist winds from the Arabian Sea are able to penetrate the region  When they collide with the mountain slopes  winter depressions provide heavy precipitation  The monsoon  although short  is generally powerful  As a result  the southern slopes of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are the wettest part of Pakistan  Annual rainfall ranges from around in the most sheltered areas to as much as in parts of Abbottabad and Mansehra Districts   This region’s climate is classed at lower elevations as humid subtropical  Cfa in the west  Cwa in the east   whilst at higher elevations with a southerly aspect it becomes classed as humid continental  Dfb   However  accurate data for altitudes above are practically nonexistent here  in Chitral  or in the south of the province  The seasonality of rainfall in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shows very marked gradients from east to west  At Dir  March remains the wettest month due to frequent frontal cloud bands  whereas in Hazara more than half the rainfall comes from the monsoon  This creates a unique situation characterized by a bimodal rainfall regime  which extends into the southern part of the province described below   Since cold air from the Siberian High loses its chilling capacity upon crossing the vast Karakoram and Himalaya ranges  winters in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are somewhat milder than in Chitral  Snow remains very frequent at high altitudes but rarely lasts long on the ground in the major towns and agricultural valleys  Outside of winter  temperatures in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are not so hot as in Chitral  Significantly higher humidity when the monsoon is active means that heat discomfort can be greater  However  even during the most humid periods the high altitudes typically allow for some relief from the heat overnight   2 1 3  Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  As one moves further away from the foothills of the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges  the climate changes from the humid subtropical climate of the foothills to the typically arid climate of Sindh  Balochistan and southern Punjab  As in central Pakhtunkhwa  the seasonality of precipitation shows a very sharp gradient from west to east  but the whole region very rarely receives significant monsoon rainfall  Even at high elevations annual rainfall is less than and in some places as little as    Temperatures in southern Pakhtunkhwa are extremely hot  Dera Ismail Khan in the southernmost district of the province is known as one of the hottest places in the world with temperatures known to have reached   In the cooler months  nights can be cold and frosts remain frequent  snow is very rare  and daytime temperatures remain comfortably warm with abundant sunshine   2 2  National Parks  3  Demographics  The province has an estimated population of about 21 million  The largest ethnic group is the Pashtun  who historically have been living in the areas for centuries  Around 1 5 million Afghan refugees also remain in the province  the majority of whom are Pashtuns followed by Tajiks  Hazaras  and other smaller groups  Despite having lived in the province for over two decades  they are registered as citizens of Afghanistan   According to the 1998 census  the population of the province was approximately 17 million  of whom 52% are males and 48% are females  The density of population is 187 per km² and the intercensal change of population is of about 30%   In most rural areas of the centre and south  Pashtun tribes can be found including the Gigyani  Their main land is Shabqadar Doaaba   Yusufzai  Bangash  Bhittani  Daavi  Khattak  Qazi khail also known as Qaziye Babar  Gandapur  Gharghasht  Marwat  Afridi  Shinwari  Orakzai  Mahsud

Pakhtunkhwa   which translates to  Land of Pakhtuns  in the Pashto language  This was opposed by some of the non Pashtuns  and especially by parties such as the Pakistan Muslim League N  PML N  and Muttahida Majlis e Amal  MMA   The PML N derives its support in the province from primarily non Pashtun Hazara regions   In 2010 the announcement that the province would have a new name led to a wave of protests in the Hazara region  On 15 April 2010 Pakistan s senate officially named the province  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  with 80 senators in favor and 12 opposed  The MMA  who until the elections of 2008 had a majority in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government  had proposed  Afghania  as a compromise name   After the 2008 general election  the Awami National Party formed a coalition provincial government with the Pakistan Peoples Party  The Awami National Party has its strongholds in the Pashtun areas of Pakistan  particularly in the Peshawar valley  while Karachi in Sindh has one of the largest Pashtun populations in the world — around 7 million by some estimates  In the 2008 election the ANP won two Sindh assembly seats in Karachi  The Awami National Party has been instrumental in fighting the Taliban  In the 2013 general election Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf won a majority in the provincial assembly and has now formed their government in coalition with Jamaat e Islami Pakistan   8
