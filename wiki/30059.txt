Troy    Ilion  or   Ilios  and   Troia  and   Hittite  Wilusa or Truwisa    is a city well known to both history and legend  as well as archaeology   and was situated in northwest Anatolia in what is now Turkey  but which was known in Classical sources as Asia Minor   located south of the southwest end of the Dardanelles Hellespont and northwest of Mount Ida at Hisaronu  It is best known for being the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle and especially in the Iliad  one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer  Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey seems to show that the name  Ilion  formerly began with a digamma   Wilion   This was later supported by the Hittite form Wilusa   A new capital called Ilium was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus  It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople and declined gradually during the Byzantine era   In 1865  English archaeologist Frank Calvert excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarlık  and in 1868  Heinrich Schliemann  a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist  also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in Çanakkale  These excavations revealed several cities built in succession  Schliemann was at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy  but was persuaded by Calvert and took over Calvert s excavations on the eastern half of the Hisarlik site  which was on Calvert s property  Troy VII has been identified with the Hittite city Wilusa  the probable origin of the Greek Ἴλιον  and is generally  but not conclusively  identified with Homeric Troy   Today  the hill at Hisarlik has given its name to a small village near the ruins  supporting the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site  It lies within the province of Çanakkale  some 30 km south west of the provincial capital  also called Çanakkale  The nearest village is Tevfikiye  The map here shows the adapted Scamander estuary with Ilium a little way inland across the Homeric plain   Troia was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998   1  Homeric Troy  Ancient Greek historians variously placed the Trojan War in the 12th  13th  or 14th centuries BC  Eratosthenes to 1184 BC  Herodotus to 1250 BC  Duris of Samos to 1334 BC  Modern archaeologists associate Homeric Troy with archaeological Troy VII   In the Iliad  the Achaeans set up their camp near the mouth of the River Scamander  presumably modern Karamenderes   where they had beached their ships  The city of Troy itself stood on a hill  across the plain of Scamander  where the battles of the Trojan War took place  The site of the ancient city is some 5 km from the coast today  but the ancient mouths of Scamander  some 3 000 years ago  were about that distance inland  pouring into a large bay forming a natural harbour that has since been filled with alluvial material  Recent geological findings have permitted the reconstruction of how the original Trojan coastline would have looked  and the results largely confirm the accuracy of the Homeric geography of Troy   In November 2001  geologists John C  Kraft from the University of Delaware and John V  Luce from Trinity College  Dublin  presented the results of investigations  begun in 1977  into the geology of the region  They compared the present geology with the landscapes and coastal features described in the Iliad and other classical sources  notably Strabo s Geographia  and concluded that there is a regular consistency between the location of Schliemann s Troy and other locations such as the Greek camp  the geological evidence  descriptions of the topography and accounts of the battle in the Iliad   Besides the Iliad  there are references to Troy in the other major work attributed to Homer  the Odyssey  as well as in other ancient Greek literature  like Aeschylus  Oresteia   The Homeric legend of Troy was elaborated by the Roman poet Virgil in his Aeneid  The Greeks and Romans took for a fact the historicity of the Trojan War and the identity of Homeric Troy with the site in Anatolia  Alexander the Great  for example  visited the site in 334 BC and made sacrifices at tombs there associated with the Homeric heroes Achilles and Patroclus   After the 1995 find of a Luwian biconvex seal at Troy VII  there has been a heated discussion over the language that was spoken in Homeric Troy  Frank Starke of the University of Tübingen recently demonstrated that the name of Priam  king of Troy at the time of the Trojan War  is connected to the Luwian compound Priimuua  which means  exceptionally courageous    The certainty is growing that Wilusa Troy belonged to the greater Luwian speaking community   although it is not entirely clear whether Luwian was primarily the official language or in daily colloquial use   1 1  Chronology in the search for Homeric Troy  Initially  the layers of Troy VI and VII were overlooked entirely  because Schliemann favoured the burnt city of Troy II  It was not until the need to close Calvert s Thousand Year Gap arose—from Dörpfeld s discovery of the walls of Troy VI—that archaeology turned away from Schliemann s Troy and began working towards finding Homeric Troy once more   1 1 1  Calvert s Thousand Year Gap  Part of the city s archaeological chronology occurred during what is called  Calvert s Thousand Year Gap   1800 800 BC   a period not accounted for by Schliemann s archaeology and thus constituting a hole in the Trojan timeline  In Homer s description of the city  a section of one side of the wall is said to be weaker than the rest  During his excavation of more than three hundred yards of the wall  Dörpfeld came across a section very closely resembling the Homeric description of the weaker section  Dörpfeld was convinced he had found the walls of Homer s city  and now he would excavate the city itself  Within the walls of this stratum  Troy VI   much Mycenaean pottery dating from LH III A and III B was uncovered  suggesting a relation between the Trojans and Mycenaeans  The great tower along the walls seemed likely to be the  Great Tower of Ilios    The evidence seemed to indicate that Dörpfeld had stumbled upon Ilios  the city of Homer s epics  Schliemann himself had conceded that Troy VI was more likely to be the Homeric city  but he never published anything stating so  The only counter argument  confirmed initially by Dörpfeld  who was as passionate as Schliemann about finding Troy   was that the city appeared to have been destroyed by an earthquake  not by men  There was little doubt that this was the Troy that the Mycenaeans would have known of   2  Archaeological Troy  The layers of ruins in the citadel at Hisarlık are numbered

archaeological site of Troy was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998   2 1  Troy I–V  The first city on the site was founded in the 3rd millennium BC  During the Bronze Age  the site seems to have been a flourishing mercantile city  since its location allowed for complete control of the Dardanelles  through which every merchant ship from the Aegean Sea heading for the Black Sea had to pass  Around 1900 BC a mass migration was set off by the Hittites to the east  Cities to the east of Troy were destroyed  and although Troy was not burned  the next period shows a change of culture indicating a new people had taken over Troy   2 2  Schliemann s Troy II  When Schliemann came across Troy II  in 1871  he believed he had found Homer s city  Schliemann and his team unearthed a large feature he dubbed the Scaean Gate  a western gate unlike the three previously found leading to the Pergamos  This gate  as he describes  was the gate that Homer had featured  As Schliemann states in his publication Troja   I have proved that in a remote antiquity there was in the plain of Troy a large city  destroyed of old by a fearful catastrophe  which had on the hill of Hisarlık only its Acropolis with its temples and a few other large edifices  southerly  and westerly direction on the site of the later Ilium  and that  consequently  this city answers perfectly to the Homeric description of the sacred site of Ilios    2 3  Troy VI  Troy VI was destroyed around 1250 BC  probably by an earthquake  Only a single arrowhead was found in this layer  and no remains of bodies  However the town quickly recovered and was rebuilt in a layout that was more orderly   2 4  Troy VII  Troy VII  which has been dated to the mid to late 13th century BC  is the most often cited candidate for the Troy of Homer  It appears to have been destroyed by war  The evidence of fire and slaughter around 1184 BC  which brought Troy VIIa to a close  led to this phase being identified with the city besieged by the Greeks during the Trojan War  This was immortalized in the Iliad written by Homer   2 5  Troy VIII  In 480  the Persian king Xerxes sacrificed 1 000 cattle at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias while marching through the Hellespontine region towards Greece  Following the Persian defeat in 480 79  Ilion and its territory became part of the continental possessions of Mytilene and remained under Mytilenaean control until the unsuccessful Mytilenean revolt in 428 7  Athens liberated the so called Actaean cities including Ilion and enrolled these communities in the Delian League  Athenian influence in the Hellespont waned following the oligarchic coup of 411  and in that year the Spartan general Mindaros emulated Xerxes by likewise sacrificing to Athena Ilias  From c  410 399  Ilion was within the sphere of influence of the local dynasts at Lampsacus  Zenis  his wife Mania  and the usurper Meidias  who administered the region on behalf of the Persian satrap Pharnabazus   In 399  the Spartan general Dercylidas expelled the Greek garrison at Ilion who were controlling the city on behalf of the Lampsacene dyansts during a campaign which rolled back Persian influence throughout the Troad  Ilion remained outside the control of the Persian satrapal administration at Dascylium until the Peace of Antalcidas in 387 6  In this period of renewed Persian control c  387 367  a statue of Ariobarzanes  the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia  was erected in front of the temple of Athena Ilias  In 360 59 the city was briefly controlled by Charidemus of Oreus  a Euboean mercenary leader who occasionally worked for the Athenians  In 359  he was expelled by the Athenian Menelaos son of Arrabaios  whom the Ilians honoured with a grant of proxeny   this is recorded in the earliest civic decree to survive from Ilion  In May 334 Alexander the Great crossed the Hellespont and came to the city  where he visited the temple of Athena Ilias  made sacrifices at the tombs of the Homeric heroes  and made the city free and exempt from taxes  According to the so called  Last Plans  of Alexander which became known after his death in June 323  he had planned to rebuild the temple of Athena Ilias on a scale that would have surpassed every other temple in the known world   Antigonus Monophthalmus took control of the Troad in 311 and created the new city of Antigoneia Troas which was a synoikism of the cities of Skepsis  Kebren  Neandreia  Hamaxitos  Larisa  and Kolonai  In c  311 306 the koinon of Athena Ilias was founded from the remaining cities in the Troad and along the Asian coast of the Dardanelles and soon after succeeded in securing a guarantee from Antigonus that he would respect their autonomy and freedom  unlike he had with the cities which were synoikized to create Antigoneia   The koinon continued to function until at least the 1st century AD and primarily consisted of cities from the Troad  although for a time in the second half of the 3rd century it also included Myrlea and Chalcedon from the eastern Propontis  The governing body of the koinon was the synedrion on which each city was represented by two delegates  The day to day running of the synedrion  especially in relation to its finances  was left to a college of five agonothetai  on which no city ever had more than one representative  This system of equal  rather than proportional  representation ensured that no one city could politically dominate the koinon  The primary purpose of the koinon was to organize the annual Panathenaia festival which was held at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias  The festival brought huge numbers of pilgrims to Ilion for the duration of the festival as well as creating an enormous market  the panegyris  which attracted traders from across the region  In addition  the koinon financed new building projects at Ilion  for example a new theatre c  306 and the expansion of the sanctuary and temple of Athena Ilias in the 3rd century  in order to make the city a suitable venue for such a large festival   In the period 302 281  Ilion and the Troad were part of the kingdom of Lysimachus  who during this time helped Ilion synoikize several nearby communities  thus expanding the city s population and territory  Lysimachus was defeated at the Battle of Corupedium in February 281 by Seleucus I Nikator  thus handing the Seleucid kingdom control of Asia Minor  and in August or September of 281 when Seleucus passed through the Troad on his way to Lysimachia in the nearby Thracian Chersonese Ilion passed a decree in honour of him  indicating the city s new loyalties  In September Seleucus was assassinated at Lysimachia by Ptolemy Keraunos  making his successor  Antiochus I Soter  the new king  In 280 or soon after Ilion passed a long decree lavishly honouring Antiochus in order to cement their relationship with him  During this period Ilion still lacked proper city walls except for the crumbling Troy VI fortifications around the citadel  and in 278 during the Gallic invasion the city was easily sacked  Ilion enjoyed a close relationship with Antiochus for the rest of his reign  for example  in 274 Antiochus granted land to his friend Aristodikides of Assos which for tax purposes was to be attached to the territory of Ilion  and c  275 269 Ilion passed a decree in honour of Metrodoros of Amphipolis who had successfully treated the king for a wound he received in battle   2 6  Troy IX  The city was destroyed by Sulla s rival  the Roman general Fimbria  in 85 BC following an eleven day siege  Later that year when Sulla had defeated Fimbria he bestowed benefactions on Ilion for its loyalty which helped with the city s rebuilding  Ilion reciprocated this act of generosity by instituting a new civic calendar which took 85 BC as its first year  However  the city remained in financial distress for several decades  despite its favoured status with Rome  In the 80s BC  Roman publicani illegally levied taxes on the sacred estates of Athena Ilias and the city was required to call on L  Julius Caesar for restitution  while in 80 BC  the city suffered an attack by pirates  In 77 BC the costs of running the annual festival of the koinon of Athena Ilias became too pressing for both Ilion and the other members of the koinon and L  Julius Caesar was once again required to arbitrate  this time reforming the festival so that it would be less of a financial burden  In 74 BC the Ilians once again demonstrated their loyalty to Rome by siding with the Roman general Lucullus against Mithridates VI  Following the final defeat of Mithridates in 63 2  Pompey rewarded the city s loyalty by becoming the benefactor of Ilion and patron of Athena Ilias  In 48 BC  Julius Caesar likewise bestowed benefactions on the city  recalling the city s loyalty during the Mithridatic Wars  the city s connection with his cousin L  Julius Caesar  and the family s claim that they were ultimately descended from Venus through the Trojan prince Aeneas and therefore shared kinship with the Ilians   In 20 BC  the Emperor Augustus visited Ilion and stayed in the house of a leading citizen  Melanippides son of Euthydikos  As a result of his visit  he also financed the restoration and rebuilding of the sanctuary of Athena Ilias  the bouleuterion  and the theatre  Soon after work on the theatre was completed in 12 11 BC  Melanippides dedicated a statue of Augustus in the theatre to record this benefaction   3  Excavation campaigns  With the rise of critical history  Troy and the Trojan War were  for a long time  consigned to the realms of legend  However  the true location of ancient Troy had from classical times remained the subject of interest and speculation  so when  in 1822  the Scottish journalist Charles Maclaren reviewed the available material  he was able to identify with confidence the position of the acropolis of Augustus s New Ilium in north western Anatolia   In 1866  Frank Calvert  the brother of the United States  consular agent in the region  made extensive surveys and published in scholarly journals his identification of the hill of New Ilium  which was on farmland owned by his family  as the site of ancient Troy  The hill  near the city of Çanakkale  was known to the Turks as Hisarlık   3 1  Schliemann  In 1868  Heinrich Schliemann visited Calvert and secured permission to excavate Hisarlık  In 1871–73 and 1878–79  he excavated the hill and discovered the ruins of a series of ancient cities dating from the Bronze Age to the Roman period  Schliemann declared one of these cities — at first Troy I  later Troy II — to be the city of Troy  and this identification was widely accepted at that time  Schliemann s finds at Hisarlık have become known as Priam s Treasure  They were acquired from him by the Berlin museums  but significant doubts about their authenticity persist   Although it is widely believed that Heinrich Schliemann was responsible for starting archaeology on his own with the discovery of Troy  this is inaccurate  Schliemann became interested in digging at the mound of Hisarlık at the persuasion of Frank Calvert  The British diplomat  considered a pioneer for the contributions he made to the archaeology of Troy  spent more than 60 years in the Troad  modern day Biga peninsula  Turkey  conducting field work  As Calvert was a principal authority on field archaeology in the region  his findings supplied evidence that Homeric Troy might exist in the hill  and played a major role in directing Heinrich Schliemann to dig at the Hisarlık   3 2  Dörpfeld and Blegen  After Schliemann  the site was further excavated under the direction of Wilhelm Dörpfeld and later Carl Blegen  1932–38   These excavations have shown that there were at least nine cities built  one on top of each other  at this site  In his research  Blegen came to a conclusion that Troy s nine levels could be further divided into forty six sublevels    3 3  Korfmann  In 1988  excavations were resumed by a team from the University of Tübingen and the University of Cincinnati under the direction of Professor Manfred Korfmann  with Professor Brian Rose overseeing Post Bronze Age  Greek  Roman  Byzantine  excavation along the coast of the Aegean Sea at the Bay of Troy  Possible evidence of a battle was found in the form of bronze arrowheads and fire damaged human remains buried in layers dated to the early 12th century BC  The question of Troy s status in the Bronze Age world has been the subject of a sometimes acerbic debate between Korfmann and the Tübingen historian Frank Kolb in 2001–2002   In August 1993  following a magnetic imaging survey of the fields below the fort  a deep ditch was located and excavated among the ruins of a later Greek and Roman city  Remains found in the ditch were dated to the late Bronze Age  the alleged time of Homeric Troy  It is claimed by Korfmann that the ditch may have once marked the outer defences of a much larger city than had previously been suspected  The latter city has been dated by his team to about 1250 BC  and it has been also suggested 舒 based on recent archeological evidence uncovered by Professor Manfred Korfmann s team 舒 that this was indeed the Homeric city of Troy   3 4  Pernicka  In summer 2006  the excavations continued under the direction of Korfmann s colleague Ernst Pernicka  with a new digging permit   3 5  2013 2014  An international team made up of cross disciplinary experts led by William Aylward  an archaeologist at the University of Wisconsin  was to carry out excavations in 2013  This activity was to be conducted under the auspices of Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University and was to use the new technique of  molecular archaeolgy   A few days before the Wisconsin team was to leave  Turkey cancelled about 100 excavation permits  including Wisconsin s   In March 2014  it was announced that a new excavation would take place to be sponsored by a private company and carried out by Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University  This will be the first Turkish team to excavate and is planned as a 12 month excavation led by associate professor Rüstem Aslan  The University s rector stated that  Pieces unearthed in Troy will contribute to Çanakkale’s culture and tourism  Maybe it will become one of Turkey’s most important frequented historical places ”  4  Hittite and Egyptian evidence  In the 1920s  the Swiss scholar Emil Forrer claimed that the placenames Wilusa and Taruisa found in Hittite texts should be identified with Ilion and Troia  respectively  He further noted that the name of Alaksandu  a king of Wilusa mentioned in a Hittite treaty  is quite similar to Homer s Paris  whose birthname was Alexandros  Subsequent to this  the Tawagalawa letter  CTH 181  was found to document an unnamed Hittite king s correspondence to the king of the Ahhiyawa  referring to an earlier  Wilusa episode  involving hostility on the part of the Ahhiyawa  The Hittite king was long held to be Mursili II  c  1321—1296   but  since the 1980s  his son Hattusili III  1265—1240  is commonly preferred  although his other son Muwatalli  c  1296—1272  remains a possibility   Inscriptions of the New Kingdom of Egypt also record a nation T R S as one of the Sea Peoples who attacked Egypt during the XIX and XX Dynasties  An inscription at Deir el Medina records a victory of Ramesses III over the Sea Peoples  including one named  Tursha   Egyptian   twrš3    It is probably the same as the earlier  Teresh   Egyptian   trš w   on the stele commemorating Merneptah s victory in a Libyan campaign around 1220 BC   These identifications were rejected by many scholars as being improbable or at least unprovable  However  Trevor Bryce championed them in his 1998 book The Kingdom of the Hittites  citing a piece of the Manapa Tarhunda letter referring to the kingdom of Wilusa as beyond the land of the Seha River  the classical Caicus and modern Bakırçay  and near the land of  Lazpa   Lesbos   Recent evidence also adds weight to the theory that Wilusa is identical to archaeological Troy  Hittite texts mention a water tunnel at Wilusa  and a water tunnel excavated by Korfmann  previously thought to be Roman  has been dated to around 2600 BC  The identifications of Wilusa with Troy and of the Ahhiyawa with Homer s Achaeans remain somewhat controversial but gained enough popularity during the 1990s to be considered majority opinion   5  In later legend  Such was the fame of the Epic Cycle in Roman and Medieval times that it was built upon to provide a starting point for various founding myths of national origins  The most influential  Virgil s Aeneid  traces the journeys of the Trojan prince Aeneas  supposed ancestor of the founders of Rome and the Julio Claudian dynasty  In a later era  the heroes of Troy  both those noted in Homer and those invented for the purpose  often continued to appear in the origin stories of the nations of Early Medieval Europe  The Roman de Troie was common cultural ground for European dynasties  as a Trojan pedigree was both gloriously ancient and established an equality with the ruling class of Rome  A Trojan pedigree could justify the occupation of parts of Rome s former territories   On that basis  the Franks filled the lacunae of their legendary origins with Trojan and pseudo Trojan names  in Fredegar s 7th century chronicle of Frankish history  Priam appears as the first king of the Franks  The Trojan origin of France was such an established article of faith that in 1714  the learned Nicolas Fréret was Bastilled for showing through historical criticism that the Franks had been Germanic  a sore point counter to Valois and Bourbon propaganda   In similar manner  Geoffrey of Monmouth reworked earlier material such as the Historia Brittonum to trace the legendary kings of the Britons from a supposed descendant of Aeneas called Brutus   Likewise  Snorri Sturluson  in the prologue to his Icelandic Prose Edda  traced the genealogy of the ancestral figures in Norse mythology to characters appearing at Troy in Homer s epic  notably making Thor to be the son of Memnon  Sturluson referred to these figures as having made a journey across Europe towards Scandinavia  setting up kingdoms as they went   6  Alternative views on Troy  A small minority of contemporary writers argue that Homeric Troy was not in Anatolia  but located elsewhere  England  Croatia  Scandinavia  or Pergamum   These proposals have not been accepted by mainstream scholarship   7  See also  Ancient settlements in Turkey  Cities of the ancient Near East  Dardanians  Trojan   The Golden Bough  mythology   Historicity of the Iliad  Troad  Trojan language  Trojan
