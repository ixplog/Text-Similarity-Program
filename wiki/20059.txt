In number theory  a multiplicative function is an arithmetic function f n  of the positive integer n with the property that f 1    1 and whenever a and b are coprime  then  An arithmetic function f n  is said to be completely multiplicative  or totally multiplicative  if f 1    1 and f ab    f a  f b  holds for all positive integers a and b  even when they are not coprime   1  Examples  Some multiplicative functions are defined to make formulas easier to write   1 n   the constant function  defined by 1 n    1  completely multiplicative   the indicator function of the set   This is multiplicative if the set C has the property that if a and b are in C  gcd a  b  1  then ab is also in C  This is the case if C is the set of squares  cubes  or higher powers  or if C is the set of square free numbers   Id n   identity function  defined by Id n    n  completely multiplicative   Idk n   the power functions  defined by Idk n    nk for any complex number k  completely multiplicative   As special cases we have  Id0 n    1 n  and  Id1 n    Id n     n   the function defined by  n    1 if n   1 and 0 otherwise  sometimes called multiplication unit for Dirichlet convolution or simply the unit function  the Kronecker delta ैin  sometimes written as u n   not to be confused with  n   completely multiplicative   Other examples of multiplicative functions include many functions of importance in number theory  such as   gcd n k   the greatest common divisor of n and k  as a function of n  where k is a fixed integer    n   Euler s totient function   counting the positive integers coprime to  but not bigger than  n   n   the Möbius function  the parity  蜢1 for odd  +1 for even  of the number of prime factors of square free numbers  0 if n is not square free  k n   the divisor function  which is the sum of the k th powers of all the positive divisors of n  where k may be any complex number   Special cases we have  0 n    d n  the number of positive divisors of n   1 n     n   the sum of all the positive divisors of n     the number of non isomorphic abelian groups of order n    n   the Liouville function  ॕ n     蜢1 ष n  where ष n  is the total number of primes  counted with multiplicity  dividing n   completely multiplicative     n   defined by  n     蜢1  n   where the additive function  n  is the number of distinct primes dividing n   All Dirichlet characters are completely multiplicative functions  For example   n p   the Legendre symbol  considered as a function of n where p is a fixed prime number  An example of a non multiplicative function is the arithmetic function r2 n    the number of representations of n as a sum of squares of two integers  positive  negative  or zero  where in counting the number of ways  reversal of order is allowed  For example   and therefore r2 1    4 ≠ 1  This shows that the function is not multiplicative  However  r2 n  4 is multiplicative   In the On Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences  have the keyword  mult    See arithmetic function for some other examples of non multiplicative functions   2  Properties  A multiplicative function is completely determined by its values at the powers of prime numbers  a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic  Thus  if n is a product of powers of distinct primes  say n   pa qb      then f n    f pa  f qb       This property of multiplicative functions significantly reduces the need for computation  as in the following examples for n   144   24 · 32   Similarly  we have   In general  if f n  is a multiplicative function and a  b are any two positive integers  then  Every completely multiplicative function is a homomorphism of monoids and is completely determined by its restriction to the prime numbers   3  Convolution  If f and g are two multiplicative functions  one defines a new multiplicative function f * g  the Dirichlet convolution of f and g  by  where the sum extends over all positive divisors d of n  With this operation  the set of all multiplicative functions turns into an abelian group  the identity element is   Convolution is commutative  associative  and distributive over addition   Relations among the multiplicative functions discussed above include   * 1    the Möbius inversion formula     Idk  * Idk    generalized Möbius inversion   * 1   Id  d   1 * 1    Id * 1   * d  k   Idk * 1  Id   * 1   *  Idk   k * The Dirichlet convolution can be defined for general arithmetic functions  and yields a ring structure  the Dirichlet ring   3 1  Dirichlet series for some multiplicative functions  More examples are shown in the article on Dirichlet series   4  Multiplicative function over  Let A   the polynomial ring over the finite field with q elements  A is principal ideal domain and therefore A is unique factorization domain   a complex valued function on A is called multiplicative if   whenever f and g are relatively prime   4 1  Zeta function and Dirichlet series in  Let h be a polynomial arithmetic function  i e  a function on set of monic polynomials over A   Its corresponding Dirichlet series define to be     where for   set if   and otherwise   The polynomial zeta function is then     Similar to the situation in   every Dirichlet series of a multiplicative function h has a product representation  Euler product       Where the product runs over all monic irreducible polynomials P   For example  the product representation of the zeta function is as for the integers     Unlike the classical zeta function  is a simple rational function      In a similar way  If Ђ and g are two polynomial arithmetic functions  one defines ƒ * g  the Dirichlet convolution of ƒ and g  by  where the sum extends over all monic divisors d of m  or equivalently over all pairs  a  b  of monic polynomials whose product is m  The identity still holds   5  See also  Euler product  Bell series  Lambert series  6  References  See chapter 2 of  7  External links
