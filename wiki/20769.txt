Mergers and acquisitions  M&A  are both aspects of strategic management  corporate finance and management dealing with the buying  selling  dividing and combining of different companies and similar entities that can help an enterprise grow rapidly in its sector or location of origin  or a new field or new location  without creating a subsidiary  other child entity or using a joint venture   M&A can be defined as a type of restructuring in that they result in some entity reorganization with the aim to provide growth or positive value  Consolidation of an industry or sector occurs when widespread M&A activity concentrates the resources of many small companies into a few larger ones  such as occurred with the automotive industry between 1910 and 1940   The distinction between a  merger  and an  acquisition  has become increasingly blurred in various respects  particularly in terms of the ultimate economic outcome   although it has not completely disappeared in all situations  From a legal point of view  a merger is a legal consolidation of two companies into one entity  whereas an acquisition occurs when one company takes over another and completely establishes itself as the new owner  in which case the target company still exists as an independent legal entity controlled by the acquirer   Either structure can result in the economic and financial consolidation of the two entities  In practice  a deal that is an acquisition for legal purposes may be euphemistically called a  merger of equals  if both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companies  while when the deal is unfriendly  that is  when the target company does not want to be purchased  it is almost always regarded as an  acquisition    1  Acquisition  An acquisition or takeover is the purchase of one business or company by another company or other business entity  Such purchase may be of 100%  or nearly 100%  of the assets or ownership equity of the acquired entity  Consolidation occurs when two companies combine together to form a new enterprise altogether  and neither of the previous companies remains independently  Acquisitions are divided into  private  and  public  acquisitions  depending on whether the acquiree or merging company  also termed a target  is or is not listed on a public stock market  Some public companies rely on acquisitions as an important value creation strategy  An additional dimension or categorization consists of whether an acquisition is friendly or hostile   Achieving acquisition success has proven to be very difficult  while various studies have shown that 50% of acquisitions were unsuccessful  The acquisition process is very complex  with many dimensions influencing its outcome   Serial acquirers  appear to be more successful with M&A than companies who only make an acquisition occasionally  see Douma & Schreuder  2013  chapter 13   The new forms of buy out created since the crisis are based on serial type acquisitions known as an ECO Buyout which is a co community ownership buy out and the new generation buy outs of the MIBO  Management Involved or Management & Institution Buy Out  and MEIBO  Management & Employee Involved Buy Out    Whether a purchase is perceived as being a  friendly  one or a  hostile  depends significantly on how the proposed acquisition is communicated to and perceived by the target company s board of directors  employees and shareholders  It is normal for M&A deal communications to take place in a so called  confidentiality bubble  wherein the flow of information is restricted pursuant to confidentiality agreements  In the case of a friendly transaction  the companies cooperate in negotiations  in the case of a hostile deal  the board and or management of the target is unwilling to be bought or the target s board has no prior knowledge of the offer  Hostile acquisitions can  and often do  ultimately become  friendly   as the acquiror secures endorsement of the transaction from the board of the acquiree company  This usually requires an improvement in the terms of the offer and or through negotiation    Acquisition  usually refers to a purchase of a smaller firm by a larger one  Sometimes  however  a smaller firm will acquire management control of a larger and or longer established company and retain the name of the latter for the post acquisition combined entity  This is known as a reverse takeover  Another type of acquisition is the reverse merger  a form of transaction that enables a private company to be publicly listed in a relatively short time frame  A reverse merger occurs when a privately held company  often one that has strong prospects and is eager to raise financing  buys a publicly listed shell company  usually one with no business and limited assets   The combined evidence suggests that the shareholders of acquired firms realize significant positive  abnormal returns  while shareholders of the acquiring company are most likely to experience a negative wealth effect  The overall net effect of M&A transactions appears to be positive  almost all studies report positive returns for the investors in the combined buyer and target firms  This implies that M&A creates economic value  presumably by transferring assets to management teams that operate them more efficiently  see Douma & Schreuder  2013  chapter 13    There are also a variety of structures used in securing control over the assets of a company  which have different tax and regulatory implications   The buyer buys the shares  and therefore control  of the target company being purchased  Ownership control of the company in turn conveys effective control over the assets of the company  but since the company is acquired intact as a going concern  this form of transaction carries with it all of the liabilities accrued by that business over its past and all of the risks that company faces in its commercial environment   The buyer buys the assets of the target company  The cash the target receives from the sell off is paid back to its shareholders by dividend or through liquidation  This type of transaction leaves the target company as an empty shell  if the buyer buys out the entire assets  A buyer often structures the transaction as an asset purchase to  cherry pick  the assets that it wants and leave out the assets and liabilities that it does not  This can be particularly important where foreseeable liabilities may include future  unquantified damage awards such as those that could arise from litigation over defective products  employee benefits or terminations  or environmental damage  A disadvantage of this structure is the tax that many jurisdictions  particularly outside the United States  impose on transfers of the individual assets  whereas stock transactions can frequently be structured as like kind exchanges or other arrangements that are tax free or tax neutral  both to the buyer and to the seller s shareholders  The terms  demerger    spin off  and  spin out  are sometimes used to indicate a situation where one company splits into two  generating a second company which may or may not become separately listed on a stock exchange   As per knowledge based views  firms can generate greater values through the retention of knowledge based resources which they generate and integrate  Extracting technological benefits during and after acquisition is ever challenging issue because of organizational differences  Based on the content analysis of seven interviews authors concluded five following components for their grounded model of acquisition   Improper documentation and changing implicit knowledge makes it difficult to share information during acquisition   For acquired firm symbolic and cultural independence which is the base of technology and capabilities are more important than administrative independence   Detailed knowledge exchange and integrations are difficult when the acquired firm is large and high performing   Management of executives from acquired firm is critical in terms of promotions and pay incentives to utilize their talent and value their expertise   Transfer of technologies and capabilities are most difficult task to manage because of complications of acquisition implementation  The risk of losing implicit knowledge is always associated with the fast pace acquisition  Preservation of tacit knowledge  employees and documentation are often difficult to achieve during and after acquisition  Strategic management of all these resources is a very important factor for a successful acquisition   An increase in acquisitions in the global business environment requires enterprises to evaluate the key stake holders of acquisition very carefully before implementation  It is imperative for the acquirer to understand this relationship and apply it to its advantage  Retention is only possible when resources are exchanged and managed without affecting their independence   2  Legal structures  Corporate acquisitions can be characterized for legal purposes as either  asset purchases  in which the seller sells business assets to the buyer  or  equity purchases  in which the buyer purchases equity interests in a target company from one or more selling shareholders  Asset purchases are common in technology transactions where the buyer is most interested in particular intellectual property rights but does not want to acquire liabilities or other contractual relationships  An asset purchase structure may also be used when the buyer wishes to buy a particular division or unit of a company which is not a separate legal entity  There are numerous challenges particular to this type of transaction  including isolating the specific assets and liabilities that pertain to the unit  determining whether the unit utilizes services from other units of the selling company  transferring employees  transferring permits and licenses  and ensuring that the seller does not compete with the buyer in the same business area in the future   Mergers  asset purchases and equity purchases are each taxed differently  and the most beneficial structure for tax purposes is highly situation dependent  One hybrid form often employed for tax purposes is a triangular merger  where the target company merges with a shell company wholly owned by the buyer  thus becoming a subsidiary of the buyer  In a  forward triangular merger   the buyer causes the target company to merge into the subsidiary  a  reverse triangular merger  is similar except that the subsidiary merges into the target company  Under the U S  Internal Revenue Code  a forward triangular merger is taxed as if the target company sold its assets to the shell company and then liquidated  whereas a reverse triangular merger is taxed as if the target company s shareholders sold their stock in the target company to the buyer   3  Documentation  The documentation of an M&A transaction often begins with a letter of intent  The letter of intent generally does not bind the parties to commit to a transaction  but may bind the parties to confidentiality and exclusivity obligations so that the transaction can be considered through a due diligence process involving lawyers  accountants  tax advisors  and other professionals  as well as business people from both sides   After due diligence is completed  the parties may proceed to draw up a definitive agreement  known as a  merger agreement    share purchase agreement  or  asset purchase agreement  depending on the structure of the transaction  Such contracts are typically 80 to 100 pages long and focus on five key types of terms   Conditions  which must be satisfied before there is an obligation to complete the transaction  Conditions typically include matters such as regulatory approvals and the lack of any material adverse change in the target s business   Representations and warranties by the seller with regard to the company  which are claimed to be true at both the time of signing and the time of closing  Sellers often attempt to craft their representations and warranties with knowledge qualifiers  dictating the level of knowledge applicable and which seller parties  knowledge is relevant  Some agreements provide that if the representations and warranties by the seller prove to be false  the buyer may claim a refund of part of the purchase price  as is common in transactions involving privately held companies  although in most acquisition agreements involving public company targets  the representations and warranties of the seller do not survive the closing   Representations regarding a target company s net working capital are a common source of post closing disputes   Covenants  which govern the conduct of the parties  both before the closing  such as covenants that restrict the operations of the business between signing and closing  and after the closing  such as covenants regarding future income tax filings and tax liability or post closing restrictions agreed to by the buyer and seller parties    Termination rights  which may be triggered by a breach of contract  a failure to satisfy certain conditions or the passage of a certain period of time without consummating the transaction  and fees and damages payable in case of a termination for certain events  also known as breakup fees   In 2013  termination fees ranged from 1 0% to 9 4% of the total transaction value   Provisions relating to obtaining required shareholder approvals under state law and related SEC filings required under federal law  if applicable  and terms related to the mechanics of the legal transactions to be consummated at closing  such as the determination and allocation of the purchase price and post closing adjustments  such as adjustments after the final determination of working capital at closing or earnout payments payable to the sellers   repayment of outstanding debt  and the treatment of outstanding shares  options and other equity interests    4  Business valuation  The five most common ways to value a business are  asset valuation   historical earnings valuation   future maintainable earnings valuation   relative valuation  comparable company and comparable transactions    discounted cash flow  DCF  valuation Professionals who value businesses generally do not use just one of these methods but a combination of some of them  as well as possibly others that are not mentioned above  in order to obtain a more accurate value  The information in the balance sheet or income statement is obtained by one of three accounting measures  a Notice to Reader  a Review Engagement or an Audit   Accurate business valuation is one of the most important aspects of M&A as valuations like these will have a major impact on the price that a business will be sold for  Most often this information is expressed in a Letter of Opinion of Value  LOV  when the business is being valuated for interest s sake  There are other  more detailed ways of expressing the value of a business  While these reports generally get more detailed and expensive as the size of a company increases  this is not always the case as there are many complicated industries which require more attention to detail  regardless of size   As synergy plays a large role in the valuation of acquisitions  it is paramount to get the value of synergies right  Synergies are different from the  sales price  valuation of the firm  as they will accrue to the buyer  Hence  the analysis should be done from the acquiring firm s point of view  Synergy creating investments are started by the choice of the acquirer  and therefore they are not obligatory  making them essentially real options  To include this real options aspect into analysis of acquisition targets is one interesting issue that has been studied lately   5  Financing  Mergers are generally differentiated from acquisitions partly by the way in which they are financed and partly by the relative size of the companies  Various methods of financing an M&A deal exist   5 1  Cash  Payment by cash  Such transactions are usually termed acquisitions rather than mergers because the shareholders of the target company are removed from the picture and the target comes under the  indirect  control of the bidder s shareholders   5 2  Stock  Payment in the form of the acquiring company s stock  issued to the shareholders of the acquired company at a given ratio proportional to the valuation of the latter   5 3  Financing options  There are some elements to think about when choosing the form of payment  When submitting an offer  the acquiring firm should consider other potential bidders and think strategically  The form of payment might be decisive for the seller  With pure cash deals  there is no doubt on the real value of the bid  without considering an eventual earnout   The contingency of the share payment is indeed removed  Thus  a cash offer preempts competitors better than securities  Taxes are a second element to consider and should be evaluated with the counsel of competent tax and accounting advisers  Third  with a share deal the buyer’s capital structure might be affected and the control of the buyer modified  If the issuance of shares is necessary  shareholders of the acquiring company might prevent such capital increase at the general meeting of shareholders  The risk is removed with a cash transaction  Then  the balance sheet of the buyer will be modified and the decision maker should take into account the effects on the reported financial results  For example  in a pure cash deal  financed from the company’s current account   liquidity ratios might decrease  On the other hand  in a pure stock for stock transaction  financed from the issuance of new shares   the company might show lower profitability ratios  e g  ROA   However  economic dilution must prevail towards accounting dilution when making the choice  The form of payment and financing options are tightly linked  If the buyer pays cash  there are three main financing options   Cash on hand  it consumes financial slack  excess cash or unused debt capacity  and may decrease debt rating  There are no major transaction costs   Issue of debt  It consumes financial slack  may decrease debt rating and increase cost of debt  Transaction costs include underwriting or closing costs of 1% to 3% of the face value   Issue of stock  it increases financial slack  may improve debt rating and reduce cost of debt  Transaction costs include fees for preparation of a proxy statement  an extraordinary shareholder meeting and registration  If the buyer pays with stock  the financing possibilities are   Issue of stock  same effects and transaction costs as described above    Shares in treasury  it increases financial slack  if they don’t have to be repurchased on the market   may improve debt rating and reduce cost of debt  Transaction costs include brokerage fees if shares are repurchased in the market otherwise there are no major costs  In general  stock will create financial flexibility  Transaction costs must also be considered but tend to have a greater impact on the payment decision for larger transactions  Finally  paying cash or with shares is a way to signal value to the other party  e g   buyers tend to offer stock when they believe their shares are overvalued and cash when undervalued   6  Specialist advisory firms  Although at present the majority of M&A advice is provided by full service investment banks  recent years have seen a rise in the prominence of specialist M&A advisers  who only provide M&A advice  and not financing   These companies are sometimes referred to as Merchant Capital Advisors or Advisors  assisting businesses often referred to as  companies in selling   To perform these services in the US  an advisor must be a licensed broker dealer  and subject to SEC  FINRA  regulation   M&A advisers can assist dealmakers in eliminating administrative inefficiencies in their transaction  such as slow payments or poorly invested escrows  These inefficiencies cost merger parties over five billion annually   7  Motivation  7 1  Improving financial performance or reducing risk  The dominant rationale used to explain M&A activity is that acquiring firms seek improved financial performance or reduce risk  The following motives are considered to improve financial performance or reduce risk   Economy of scale  This refers to the fact that the combined company can often reduce its fixed costs by removing duplicate departments or operations  lowering the costs of the company relative to the same revenue stream  thus increasing profit margins   Economy of scope  This refers to the efficiencies primarily associated with demand side changes  such as increasing or decreasing the scope of marketing and distribution  of different types of products   Increased revenue or market share  This assumes that the buyer will be absorbing a major competitor and thus increase its market power  by capturing increased market share  to set prices   Cross selling  For example  a bank buying a stock broker could then sell its banking products to the stock broker s customers  while the broker can sign up the bank s customers for brokerage accounts  Or  a manufacturer can acquire and sell complementary products   Synergy  For example  managerial economies such as the increased opportunity of managerial specialization  Another example is purchasing economies due to increased order size and associated bulk buying discounts   Taxation  A profitable company can buy a loss maker to use the target s loss as their advantage by reducing their tax liability  In the United States and many other countries  rules are in place to limit the ability of profitable companies to  shop  for loss making companies  limiting the tax motive of an acquiring company   Geographical or other diversification  This is designed to smooth the earnings results of a company  which over the long term smoothens the stock price of a company  giving conservative investors more confidence in investing in the company  However  this does not always deliver value to shareholders  see below    Resource transfer  resources are unevenly distributed across firms  Barney  1991  and the interaction of target and acquiring firm resources can create value through either overcoming information asymmetry or by combining scarce resources   Vertical integration  Vertical integration occurs when an upstream and downstream firm merge  or one acquires the other   There are several reasons for this to occur  One reason is to internalise an externality problem  A common example of such an externality is double marginalization  Double marginalization occurs when both the upstream and downstream firms have monopoly power and each firm reduces output from the competitive level to the monopoly level  creating two deadweight losses  Following a merger  the vertically integrated firm can collect one deadweight loss by setting the downstream firm s output to the competitive level  This increases profits and consumer surplus  A merger that creates a vertically integrated firm can be profitable   Hiring  some companies use acquisitions as an alternative to the normal hiring process  This is especially common when the target is a small private company or is in the startup phase  In this case  the acquiring company simply hires   acquhires   the staff of the target private company  thereby acquiring its talent  if that is its main asset and appeal   The target private company simply dissolves and little legal issues are involved   Absorption of similar businesses under single management  similar portfolio invested by two different mutual funds namely united money market fund and united growth and income fund  caused the management to absorb united money market fund into united growth and income fund   Access to hidden or nonperforming assets  land  real estate    7 2  Other types  However  on average and across the most commonly studied variables  acquiring firms  financial performance does not positively change as a function of their acquisition activity  Therefore  additional motives for merger and acquisition that may not add shareholder value include   Diversification  While this may hedge a company against a downturn in an individual industry it fails to deliver value  since it is possible for individual shareholders to achieve the same hedge by diversifying their portfolios at a much lower cost than those associated with a merger   In his book One Up on Wall Street  Peter Lynch termed this  diworseification     Manager s hubris  manager s overconfidence about expected synergies from M&A which results in overpayment for the target company   Empire building  Managers have larger companies to manage and hence more power   Manager s compensation  In the past  certain executive management teams had their payout based on the total amount of profit of the company  instead of the profit per share  which would give the team a perverse incentive to buy companies to increase the total profit while decreasing the profit per share  which hurts the owners of the company  the shareholders    8  Different types  8 1  By functional roles in market  The M&A process itself is a multifaceted which depends upon the type of merging companies   A horizontal merger is usually between two companies in the same business sector  The example of horizontal merger would be if a health care system buys another health care system  This means that synergy can obtained through many forms including such as  increased market share  cost savings and exploring new market opportunities   A vertical merger represents the buying of supplier of a business  In the same example as above if a health care system buys the ambulance services from their service suppliers is an example of vertical buying  The vertical buying is aimed at reducing overhead cost of operations and economy of scale   Conglomerate M&A is the third form of M&A process which deals the merger between two irrelevant companies  The example of conglomerate M&A with relevance to above scenario would be if health care system buys a restaurant chain  The objective may be diversification of capital investment   8 2  Arm s length mergers  An arm s length merger is a merger   approved by disinterested directors and  approved by disinterested stockholders  ″The two elements are complementary and not substitutes  The first element is important because the directors have the capability to act as effective and active bargaining agents  which disaggregated stockholders do not  But  because bargaining agents are not always effective or faithful  the second element is critical  because it gives the minority stockholders the opportunity to reject their agents  work  Therefore  when a merger with a controlling stockholder was  1  negotiated and approved by a special committee of independent directors  and 2  conditioned on an affirmative vote of a majority of the minority stockholders  the business judgment standard of review should presumptively apply  and any plaintiff ought to have to plead particularized facts that  if true  support an inference that  despite the facially fair process  the merger was tainted because of fiduciary wrongdoing ″  8 3  Strategic mergers  A Strategic merger usually refers to long term strategic holding of target  Acquired  firm  This type of M&A process aims at creating synergies in the long run by increased market share  broad customer base  and corporate strength of business  A strategic acquirer may also be willing to pay a premium offer to target firm in the outlook of the synergy value created after M&A process   8 4  Acqui hire  The term  acqui hire  is used to refer to acquisitions where the acquiring company seeks to obtain the target company s talent  rather than their products  which are often discontinued as part of the acquisition so the team can focus on projects for their new employer   In recent years  these types of acquisitions have become common in the technology industry  where major web companies such as Facebook  Twitter  and Yahoo  have frequently used talent acquisitions to add expertise in particular areas to their workforces   9  Research and statistics for acquired organizations  Given that the cost of replacing an executive can run over 100% of his or her annual salary  any investment of time and energy in re recruitment will likely pay for itself many times over if it helps a business retain just a handful of key players that would have otherwise left   Organizations should move rapidly to re recruit key managers  It’s much easier to succeed with a team of quality players that one selects deliberately rather than try to win a game with those who randomly show up to play   10  Brand considerations  Mergers and acquisitions often create brand problems  beginning with what to call the company after the transaction and going down into detail about what to do about overlapping and competing product brands  Decisions about what brand equity to write off are not inconsequential  And  given the ability for the right brand choices to drive preference and earn a price premium  the future success of a merger or acquisition depends on making wise brand choices  Brand decision makers essentially can choose from four different approaches to dealing with naming issues  each with specific pros and cons   Keep one name and discontinue the other  The strongest legacy brand with the best prospects for the future lives on  In the merger of United Airlines and Continental Airlines  the United brand will continue forward  while Continental is retired   Keep one name and demote the other  The strongest name becomes the company name and the weaker one is demoted to a divisional brand or product brand  An example is Caterpillar Inc  keeping the Bucyrus International name   Keep both names and use them together  Some companies try to please everyone and keep the value of both brands by using them together  This can create an unwieldy name  as in the case of PricewaterhouseCoopers  which has since changed its brand name to  PwC    Discard both legacy names and adopt a totally new one  The classic example is the merger of Bell Atlantic with GTE  which became Verizon Communications  Not every merger with a new name is successful  By consolidating into YRC Worldwide  the company lost the considerable value of both Yellow Freight and Roadway Corp  The factors influencing brand decisions in a merger or acquisition transaction can range from political to tactical  Ego can drive choice just as well as rational factors such as brand value and costs involved with changing brands   Beyond the bigger issue of what to call the company after the transaction comes the ongoing detailed choices about what divisional  product and service brands to keep  The detailed decisions about the brand portfolio are covered under the topic brand architecture   11  History  Most histories of M&A begin in the late 19th century U S  However  mergers coincide historically with the existence of companies  In 1708  for example  the East India Company merged with an erstwhile competitor to restore its monopoly over Indian trade  In 1784  the Italian Monte dei Paschi and Monte Pio banks were united as the Monti Reuniti  In 1821  the Hudson s Bay Company merged with the rival North West Company   11 1  The Great Merger Movement  1895–1905  The Great Merger Movement was a predominantly U S  business phenomenon that happened from 1895 to 1905  During this time  small firms with little market share consolidated with similar firms to form large  powerful institutions that dominated their markets  It is estimated that more than 1 800 of these firms disappeared into consolidations  many of which acquired substantial shares of the markets in which they operated  The vehicle used were so called trusts  In 1900 the value of firms acquired in mergers was 20% of GDP  In 1990 the value was only 3% and from 1998 to 2000 it was around 10–11% of GDP  Companies such as DuPont  US Steel  and General Electric that merged during the Great Merger Movement were able to keep their dominance in their respective sectors through 1929  and in some cases today  due to growing technological advances of their products  patents  and brand recognition by their customers  There were also other companies that held the greatest market share in 1905 but at the same time did not have the competitive advantages of the companies like DuPont and General Electric  These companies such as International Paper and American Chicle saw their market share decrease significantly by 1929 as smaller competitors joined forces with each other and provided much more competition  The companies that merged were mass producers of homogeneous goods that could exploit the efficiencies of large volume production  In addition  many of these mergers were capital intensive  Due to high fixed costs  when demand fell  these newly merged companies had an incentive to maintain output and reduce prices  However more often than not mergers were  quick mergers   These  quick mergers  involved mergers of companies with unrelated technology and different management  As a result  the efficiency gains associated with mergers were not present  The new and bigger company would actually face higher costs than competitors because of these technological and managerial differences  Thus  the mergers were not done to see large efficiency gains  they were in fact done because that was the trend at the time  Companies which had specific fine products  like fine writing paper  earned their profits on high margin rather than volume and took no part in Great Merger Movement   11 1 1  Short run factors  One of the major short run factors that sparked The Great Merger Movement was the desire to keep prices high  However  high prices attracted the entry of new firms into the industry   A major catalyst behind the Great Merger Movement was the Panic of 1893  which led to a major decline in demand for many homogeneous goods  For producers of homogeneous goods  when demand falls  these producers have more of an incentive to maintain output and cut prices  in order to spread out the high fixed costs these producers faced  i e  lowering cost per unit  and the desire to exploit efficiencies of maximum volume production  However  during the Panic of 1893  the fall in demand led to a steep fall in prices   Another economic model proposed by Naomi R  Lamoreaux for explaining the steep price falls is to view the involved firms acting as monopolies in their respective markets  As quasi monopolists  firms set quantity where marginal cost equals marginal revenue and price where this quantity intersects demand  When the Panic of 1893 hit  demand fell and along with demand  the firm’s marginal revenue fell as well  Given high fixed costs  the new price was below average total cost  resulting in a loss  However  also being in a high fixed costs industry  these costs can be spread out through greater production  i e  Higher quantity produced   To return to the quasi monopoly model  in order for a firm to earn profit  firms would steal part of another firm’s market share by dropping their price slightly and producing to the point where higher quantity and lower price exceeded their average total cost  As other firms joined this practice  prices began falling everywhere and a price war ensued   One strategy to keep prices high and to maintain profitability was for producers of the same good to collude with each other and form associations  also known as cartels  These cartels were thus able to raise prices right away  sometimes more than doubling prices  However  these prices set by cartels only provided a short term solution because cartel members would cheat on each other by setting a lower price than the price set by the cartel  Also  the high price set by the cartel would encourage new firms to enter the industry and offer competitive pricing  causing prices to fall once again  As a result  these cartels did not succeed in maintaining high prices for a period of more than a few years  The most viable solution to this problem was for firms to merge  through horizontal integration  with other top firms in the market in order to control a large market share and thus successfully set a higher price   11 1 2  Long run factors  In the long run  due to desire to keep costs low  it was advantageous for firms to merge and reduce their transportation costs thus producing and transporting from one location rather than various sites of different companies as in the past  Low transport costs  coupled with economies of scale also increased firm size by two  to fourfold during the second half of the nineteenth century  In addition  technological changes prior to the merger movement within companies increased the efficient size of plants with capital intensive assembly lines allowing for economies of scale  Thus improved technology and transportation were forerunners to the Great Merger Movement  In part due to competitors as mentioned above  and in part due to the government  however  many of these initially successful mergers were eventually dismantled  The U S  government passed the Sherman Act in 1890  setting rules against price fixing and monopolies  Starting in the 1890s with such cases as Addyston Pipe and Steel Company v  United States  the courts attacked large companies for strategizing with others or within their own companies to maximize profits  Price fixing with competitors created a greater incentive for companies to unite and merge under one name so that they were not competitors anymore and technically not price fixing   The economic history has been divided into Merger Waves based on the merger activities in the business world as   11 1 3  Objectives in more recent merger waves  During the third merger wave  1965–1989   corporate marriages involved more diverse companies  Acquirers more frequently bought into different industries  Sometimes this was done to smooth out cyclical bumps  to diversify  the hope being that it would hedge an investment portfolio   Starting in the fifth merger wave  1992–1998  and continuing today  companies are more likely to acquire in the same business  or close to it  firms that complement and strengthen an acquirer’s capacity to serve customers   Buyers aren’t necessarily hungry for the target companies’ hard assets  Some are more interested in acquiring thoughts  methodologies  people and relationships  Paul Graham recognized this in his 2005 essay  Hiring is Obsolete   in which he theorizes that the free market is better at identifying talent  and that traditional hiring practices do not follow the principles of free market because they depend a lot upon credentials and university degrees  Graham was probably the first to identify the trend in which large companies such as Google  Yahoo  or Microsoft were choosing to acquire startups instead of hiring new recruits   Many companies are being bought for their patents  licenses  market share  name brand  research staff  methods  customer base  or culture  Soft capital  like this  is very perishable  fragile  and fluid  Integrating it usually takes more finesse and expertise than integrating machinery  real estate  inventory and other tangibles   12  Cross border  In a study conducted in 2000 by Lehman Brothers  it was found that  on average  large M&A deals cause the domestic currency of the target corporation to appreciate by 1% relative to the acquirer s local currency   The rise of globalization has exponentially increased the necessity for agencies such as the Mergers and Acquisitions International Clearing  MAIC   trust accounts and securities clearing services for Like Kind Exchanges for cross border M&A  In 1997 alone  there were over 2 333 cross border transactions  worth a total of approximately $298 billion  Due to the complicated nature of cross border M&A and the additional burden of complying with the unique laws and regulations of a seller s jurisdiction  the vast majority of cross border actions are unsuccessful as companies seek to expand their global footprint and become more agile at creating high performing businesses and cultures across national boundaries  Nonetheless  the current surge in global cross border M&A has been called the  New Era of Global Economic Discovery    Even mergers of companies with headquarters in the same country can often be considered international in scale and require MAIC custodial services  For example  when Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas  the two American companies had to integrate operations in dozens of countries around the world  1997   This is just as true for other apparently  single country  mergers  such as the 29 billion dollar merger of Swiss drug makers Sandoz and Ciba Geigy  now Novartis    13  Failure  Despite the goal of performance improvement  results from mergers and acquisitions  M&A  are often disappointing compared with results predicted or expected  Numerous empirical studies show high failure rates of M&A deals  Studies are mostly focused on individual determinants  A book by Thomas Straub  2007   Reasons for frequent failure in Mergers and Acquisitions  develops a comprehensive research framework that bridges different perspectives and promotes an understanding of factors underlying M&A performance in business research and scholarship  The study should help managers in the decision making process  The first important step towards this objective is the development of a common frame of reference that spans conflicting theoretical assumptions from different perspectives  On this basis  a comprehensive framework is proposed with which to understand the origins of M&A performance better and address the problem of fragmentation by integrating the most important competing perspectives in respect of studies on M&A  Furthermore  according to the existing literature  relevant determinants of firm performance are derived from each dimension of the model  For the dimension strategic management  the six strategic variables  market similarity  market complementarities  production operation similarity  production operation complementarities  market power  and purchasing power were identified as having an important impact on M&A performance  For the dimension organizational behavior  the variables acquisition experience  relative size  and cultural differences were found to be important  Finally  relevant determinants of M&A performance from the financial field were acquisition premium  bidding process  and due diligence  Three different ways in order to best measure post M&A performance are recognized  synergy realization  absolute performance  and finally relative performance   Employee turnover contributes to M&A failures  The turnover in target companies is double the turnover experienced in non merged firms for the ten years following the merger  Modern M&A deals require efficient information technology  IT  integration in order to avoid failure   14  Major
