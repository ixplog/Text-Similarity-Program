Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5  1977  to study the outer Solar System  Operating for as of   the spacecraft communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and return data  At a distance of about from Earth as of December 6  2014 and traveling at a velocity of   it is the farthest spacecraft from Earth   The primary mission ended on November 20  1980  after encounters with the Jovian system in 1979 and the Saturnian system in 1980  It was the first probe to provide detailed images of the two planets and their moons  It also studied the weather  magnetic fields  and rings of those worlds  As part of the Voyager program  like its sister craft Voyager 2  the spacecraft is in an extended mission to locate and study the regions and boundaries of the outer heliosphere  and finally to begin exploring the interstellar medium   On September 12  2013  NASA confirmed that Voyager 1 had crossed the heliopause and entered interstellar space on August 25  2012  making it the first spacecraft to do so  Two years later  NASA reported that Voyager 1 began experiencing a new third  tsunami wave   generated from activity  coronal mass ejections  on the Sun  that has continued to at least December 15  2014  further confirming that the probe is in indeed in interstellar space  Voyager 1 s mission is expected to continue until around 2025  when its radioisotope thermoelectric generators will no longer supply enough power to operate any of its scientific instruments   1  Mission background  1 1  History  In the 1960s  a Grand Tour to study the outer planets was proposed  This prompted NASA to begin work on a mission in the early 1970s   Information gathered by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft helped Voyager s engineers design Voyager to cope more effectively with the intense radiation environment around Jupiter   Originally  Voyager 1 was planned as  Mariner 11  of the Mariner program  Due to budget cuts  the mission was scaled back to be a flyby of Jupiter and Saturn and renamed the Mariner Jupiter Saturn probes  As the program progressed  the name was later changed to Voyager  since the probe designs began to differ greatly from previous Mariner missions   1 2  Spacecraft design  Voyager 1 was constructed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  It has 16 hydrazine thrusters  three axis stabilization gyroscopes  and referencing instruments to keep the probe s radio antenna pointed toward Earth  Collectively  these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem  AACS   along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters  The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space   1 2 1  Communication system  The radio communication system of Voyager 1 was designed to be used up to and beyond the limits of the Solar System  The communication system includes a diameter parabolic dish high gain antenna to send and receive radio waves via the three Deep Space Network stations on the Earth  Voyager 1 normally transmits data to Earth over Deep Space Network Channel 18  using a frequency of either 2 3 GHz or 8 4 GHz  while signals from Earth to Voyager are broadcast at 2 1 GHz   When Voyager 1 is unable to communicate directly with the Earth  its digital tape recorder  DTR  can record about 64 megabytes of data for transmission at another time    signals from Voyager 1 take over 18 hours to reach Earth   1 2 2  Power  Voyager 1 has three radioisotope thermoelectric generators  RTGs  mounted on a boom  Each MHW RTG contains 24 pressed plutonium 238 oxide spheres  The RTGs generated about 470 watts of electric power at the time of launch  with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat  The power output of the RTGs does decline over time  due to the short 87 7 year half life of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples   but the RTGs of Voyager 1 will continue to support some of its operations until 2025   File Voyager Program   RTG diagram 1 png Diagram of RTG fuel container  showing the plutonium 238 oxide spheres File Voyager Program   RTG diagram 2 png

Voyager 1 only has % of the plutonium 238 that it had at launch  By 2025  it will have only % left   1 2 3  Computers  Unlike the other onboard instruments  the operation of the cameras for visible light is not autonomous  but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the on board digital computers  the Flight Data Subsystem  FDS   More recent space probes  since about 1990  usually have completely autonomous cameras   The computer command subsystem  CCS  controls the cameras  The CCS contains fixed computer programs such as command decoding  fault detection  and correction routines  antenna pointing routines  and spacecraft sequencing routines  This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the Viking orbiter  The hardware in both custom built CCS subsystems in the Voyagers is identical  There is only a minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks   The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem  AACS  controls the spacecraft orientation  its attitude   It keeps the high gain antenna pointing towards the Earth  controls attitude changes  and points the scan platform  The custom built AACS systems on both Voyagers are the same   1 2 4  Scientific instruments  For more details on the Voyager space probes  identical instrument packages  see the separate article on the overall Voyager Program   2  Mission profile  2 1  Launch and trajectory  The Voyager 1 probe was launched on September 5  1977  from Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station  aboard a Titan IIIE launch vehicle  The Voyager 2 probe had been launched two weeks earlier  on August 20  1977  Despite being launched later  Voyager 1 reached both Jupiter and Saturn sooner  following a shorter trajectory   2 2  Encounter with Jupiter  Voyager 1 began photographing Jupiter in January 1979  Its closest approach to Jupiter was on March 5  1979  at a distance of about from the planet s center  Because of the greater photographic resolution allowed by a closer approach  most observations of the moons  rings  magnetic fields  and the radiation belt environment of the Jovian system were made during the 48 hour period that bracketed the closest approach  Voyager 1 finished photographing the Jovian system in April 1979   Discovery of active volcanic activity on the satellite Io was probably the greatest surprise  It was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System  It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system  Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere   the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet s strong magnetic field  Sulfur  oxygen  and sodium  apparently erupted by Io s volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high energy particles  were detected at the outer edge of the magnetosphere of Jupiter   The two Voyager space probes made a number of important discoveries about Jupiter  its satellites  its radiation belts  and its never before seen planetary rings  File Jupiter from Voyager 1 PIA02855 thumbnail 300px max

Saturn and its system of moons and rings  Voyager 1 s Saturnian flyby occurred in November 1980  with the closest approach on November 12  1980  when the space probe came within of Saturn s cloud tops  The space probe s cameras detected complex structures in the rings of Saturn  and its remote sensing instruments studied the atmospheres of Saturn and its giant moon Titan   Voyager 1 found that about 7 percent of the volume of Saturn s upper atmosphere is helium  compared with 11 percent of Jupiter s atmosphere   while almost all the rest is hydrogen  Since Saturn s internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter s and the Sun s  the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn s hydrogen  that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun  Winds blow at high speeds in Saturn  Near the equator  the Voyagers measured winds about 500 m s  1 100 mph   The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction   The Voyagers found aurora like ultraviolet emissions of hydrogen at mid latitudes in the atmosphere  and auroras at polar latitudes  above 65 degrees   The high level auroral activity may lead to formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward the equator  The mid latitude auroras  which occur only in sunlit regions  remain a puzzle  since bombardment by electrons and ions  known to cause auroras on Earth  occurs primarily at high latitudes   Both Voyagers measured the rotation of Saturn  the length of a day  at 10 hours  39 minutes  24 seconds   Because Pioneer 11 had one year earlier detected a thick  gaseous atmosphere over Titan  the Voyager space probes  controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory elected for Voyager 1 to make a close approach of Titan  Its trajectory with a close fly by of Titan caused a gravitational deflection that sent Voyager 1 out of the plane of the ecliptic  thus ending its planetary science mission  Voyager 1 could have been directed to visit Uranus and Neptune  later accomplished by Voyager 2   Also  Voyager 1 could have been commanded onto a different trajectory  whereby the gravitational slingshot effect of Saturn s mass would have steered and boosted it out to a fly by of Pluto  However  this Plutonian option was not exercised  because the close fly by of Titan was determined to have more scientific value and less risk   File Vg1 p23254 hires jpg alt View of Saturn lit from the right  Saturn s globe casts its shadow over the rings to the left  Part of

includes the image of planet Earth known as  Pale Blue Dot   Soon afterwards its cameras were deactivated to conserve power and computer resources for other equipment  The camera software has been removed from the spacecraft  so it would now be complex to get them working again  Earth side software and computers for reading the images are also no longer available   On February 17  1998  Voyager 1 reached a distance of 69 AU from the Sun and overtook Pioneer 10 as the most distant spacecraft from Earth  Travelling at about it has the fastest heliocentric recession speed of any spacecraft   As Voyager 1 headed for interstellar space  its instruments continued to study the Solar System  Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists used the plasma wave experiments aboard Voyager 1 and 2 to look for the heliopause  the boundary at which the solar wind transitions into the interstellar medium    the probe was moving with a relative velocity to the Sun of about 17 030 km s  With the velocity the probe is currently maintaining  Voyager 1 is traveling about 520 million kilometers per year  325 million miles per year    3 1  Termination shock  Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory believed that Voyager 1 had entered the termination shock in February 2003  This marks the point where the solar wind slows down to subsonic speeds  Some other scientists expressed doubt  discussed in the journal Nature of November 6  2003  The issue would not be resolved until other data became available  since Voyager 1 s solar wind detector ceased functioning in 1990  This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board   In May 2005  a NASA press release said that the consensus was that Voyager 1 was then in the heliosheath  In a scientific session at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans on the morning of May 25  2005  Dr  Ed Stone presented evidence that Voyager 1 crossed the termination shock in late 2004  This event is believed to have occurred on December 15  2004 at a distance of 94 AU from the Sun   3 2  Heliosheath  On March 31  2006  amateur radio operators from AMSAT in Germany tracked and received radio waves from Voyager 1 using the dish at Bochum with a long integration technique  Retrieved data was checked and verified against data from the Deep Space Network station at Madrid  Spain  This is believed to be the first such amateur tracking of Voyager 1   It was confirmed on December 13  2010 that Voyager 1 had passed the reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind  as measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle device  It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere  Since June 2010  detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero  providing conclusive evidence of the event  On this date  the spacecraft was approximately from the Sun   Voyager 1 was commanded to change its orientation to measure the sideways motion of the solar wind at that location in space on March 2011  A test roll done in February had confirmed the spacecraft s ability to maneuver and reorient itself  The course of the spacecraft was not changed  It rotated 70 degrees counterclockwise with respect to Earth to detect the solar wind  This was the first time the spacecraft had done any major maneuvering since the family portrait photograph of the planets was taken in 1990  After the first roll the spacecraft had no problem in reorienting itself with Alpha Centauri  Voyager 1 s guide star  and it resumed sending transmissions back to Earth  Voyager 1 was expected to enter interstellar space  at any time   Voyager 2 was still detecting outward flow of solar wind at that point but it was estimated that in the following months or years it would experience the same conditions as Voyager 1   The spacecraft was reported at 12 44° declination and 17 163 hours right ascension  and at an ecliptic latitude of 34 9°  the ecliptic latitude changes very slowly   placing it in the constellation Ophiuchus as observed from the Earth on May 21  2011   On December 1  2011  it was announced that Voyager 1 had detected the first Lyman alpha radiation originating from the Milky Way galaxy  Lyman alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies  but because of interference from the Sun  the radiation from the Milky Way was not detectable   NASA announced on December 5  2011 that Voyager 1 had entered a new region referred to as a  cosmic purgatory   Within this stagnation region  charged particles streaming from the Sun slow and turn inward  and the Solar System s magnetic field is doubled in strength as interstellar space appears to be applying pressure  Energetic particles originating in the Solar System decline by nearly half  while the detection of high energy electrons from outside increases 100 fold  The inner edge of the stagnation region is located approximately 113 astronomical units from the Sun   3 3  Heliopause  NASA announced in June 2012 that the probe was detecting changes in the environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause  Voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space  which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the Sun  The craft thus began to enter the interstellar medium at the edge of the Solar System   Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause in August 2012  then at a distance of 121 AU from the Sun  although this was not confirmed for another year   As of September 2012  sunlight took 16 89 hours to get to Voyager 1 which was at a distance of 121 AU  The apparent magnitude of the Sun from the spacecraft was −16 3  Voyager 1 was traveling at relative to the Sun  about 3 595 AU per year   It would need about 17 565 years at this speed to travel a complete light year  To compare  Proxima Centauri  the closest star to the Sun  is about 4 2 light years  or   distant  Were the spacecraft traveling in the direction of that star  73 775 years would pass before reaching it   Voyager 1 is heading in the direction of the constellation Ophiuchus    In late 2012  researchers reported that particle data from the spacecraft suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause  Measurements from the spacecraft revealed a steady rise since May in collisions with high energy particles  above 70 MeV   which are believed to be cosmic rays emanating from supernova explosions far beyond the Solar System  with a sharp increase in these collisions in late August  At the same time  in late August  there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low energy particles  which are thought to originate from the Sun  Ed Roelof  space scientist at Johns Hopkins University and principal investigator for the Low Energy Charged Particle instrument on the spacecraft declared that  Most scientists involved with Voyager 1 would agree that  these two criteria  have been sufficiently satisfied   However  the last criterion for officially declaring that Voyager 1 had crossed the boundary  the expected change in magnetic field direction  from that of the Sun to that of the interstellar field beyond   had not been observed  the field had changed direction by only 2 degrees   which suggested to some that the nature of the edge of the heliosphere had been misjudged  On December 3  2012  Voyager project scientist Ed Stone of the California Institute of Technology said   Voyager has discovered a new region of the heliosphere that we had not realized was there  We re still inside  apparently  But the magnetic field now is connected to the outside  So it s like a highway letting particles in and out   The magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than Voyager 1 encountered before the termination shock  It was expected to be the last barrier before the spacecraft exited the Solar System completely and entered interstellar space   In March 2013  it was announced that Voyager 1 might have become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space  having detected a marked change in the plasma environment on August 25  2012  However  until September 12  2013  it was still an open question as to whether the new region was interstellar space or an unknown region of the Solar System  At that time  the former alternative was officially confirmed   Voyager 1 reached a distance of 125 AU from the Sun on August 2  2013   4  Interstellar medium  On September 12  2013  NASA officially confirmed that Voyager 1 had reached the interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed  with a generally accepted date of August 25  2012  the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected  By this point most space scientists had abandoned the belief that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause  a new model of the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found  A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80 fold increase in electron density  based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9  2013  triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012  Electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within   Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012 provided additional data  An indirect measurement was required because Voyager 1 s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980  In September 2013  NASA released audio renditions of these plasma waves  The recordings represent the first sounds to be captured in interstellar space   While Voyager 1 is commonly spoken of as having left the Solar System simultaneously with having left the heliosphere  the two are not the same  The Solar System is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the Sun  The craft is presently less than one seventh the distance to the aphelion of Sedna  and it has not yet entered the Oort cloud  the source region of long period comets  regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the Solar System   5  Future of the probe  Voyager 1 will reach the Oort cloud in about 300 years and take about 30 000 years to pass through it  Though it is not heading towards any particular star  in about 40 000 years  it will pass within 1 6 light years of the star Gliese 445  which is at present in the constellation Camelopardalis  That star is generally moving towards the Solar System at about   NASA says that  The Voyagers are destined—perhaps eternally—to wander the Milky Way    Provided Voyager 1 does not collide with anything and is not retrieved  the New Horizons space probe will never pass it  despite being launched from Earth at a faster speed than either Voyager spacecraft  New Horizons is traveling at about 15 km s  2 km s slower than Voyager 1  and is still slowing down  When New Horizons reaches the same distance from the Sun as Voyager 1 is now  its speed will be about 13 km s  8 mi s    5 1  Golden record  Each Voyager space probe carries a gold plated audio visual disc in the event
