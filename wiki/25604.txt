Radon is a chemical element with symbol Rn and atomic number 86  It is a radioactive  colorless  odorless  tasteless noble gas  occurring naturally as an indirect decay product of uranium or thorium  Its most stable isotope  222Rn  has a half life of 3 8 days  Radon is one of the densest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions  It is also the only gas under normal conditions that only has radioactive isotopes  and is considered a health hazard due to its radioactivity  Intense radioactivity has also hindered chemical studies of radon and only a few compounds are known   Radon is formed as one intermediate step in the normal radioactive decay chains  through which thorium and uranium slowly decay into lead  Thorium and uranium are the two most common radioactive elements on earth  they have been around since the earth was formed  Their naturally occurring isotopes have very long half lives  on the order of billions of years  Thorium and uranium  their decay product radium  and its decay product radon  will therefore continue to occur for tens of millions of years at almost the same concentrations as they do now  As radon itself decays  it produces new radioactive elements called radon daughters or decay products  Unlike the gaseous radon itself  radon daughters are solids and stick to surfaces  such as dust particles in the air  If such contaminated dust is inhaled  these particles can stick to the airways of the lung and increase the risk of developing lung cancer   Unlike all the other intermediate elements in the aforementioned decay chains  radon is gaseous and easily inhaled  Thus  even in this age of nuclear reactors  naturally occurring radon is responsible for the majority of the public exposure to ionizing radiation  It is often the single largest contributor to an individual s background radiation dose  and is the most variable from location to location  Despite its short lifetime  some radon gas from natural sources can accumulate to far higher than normal concentrations in buildings  especially in low areas such as basements and crawl spaces due to its heavy nature  It can also be found in some spring waters and hot springs   Epidemiological studies have shown a clear link between breathing high concentrations of radon and incidence of lung cancer  Thus  radon is considered a significant contaminant that affects indoor air quality worldwide  According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency  radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer  after cigarette smoking  causing 21 000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States  About 2 900 of these deaths occur among people who have never smoked  While radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer  it is the number one cause among non smokers  according to EPA estimates   1  Characteristics  1 1  Physical properties  Radon is a colorless  odorless  and tasteless gas and therefore not detectable by human senses alone  At standard temperature and pressure  radon forms a monatomic gas with a density of 9 73 kg m3  about 8 times the density of the Earth s atmosphere at sea level  1 217 kg m3  Radon is one of the densest gases at room temperature and is the densest of the noble gases  Although colorless at standard temperature and pressure  when cooled below its freezing point of   radon emits a brilliant radioluminescence that turns from yellow to orange red as the temperature lowers  Upon condensation  radon glows because of the intense radiation it produces  Radon is sparingly soluble in water  but more soluble than lighter noble gases  Radon is appreciably more soluble in organic liquids than in water   1 2  Chemical properties  Being a noble gas  radon is chemically not very reactive  However  the 3 8 day half life of radon 222 makes it useful in physical sciences as a natural tracer   Radon is a member of the zero valence elements that are called noble gases  It is inert to most common chemical reactions  such as combustion  because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons  This produces a stable  minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound  1037 kJ mol is required to extract one electron from its shells  also known as the first ionization energy   However  in accordance with periodic trends  radon has a lower electronegativity than the element one period before it  xenon  and is therefore more reactive  Early studies concluded that the stability of radon hydrate should be of the same order as that of the hydrates of chlorine    or sulfur dioxide     and significantly higher than the stability of the hydrate of hydrogen sulfide      Because of its cost and radioactivity  experimental chemical research is seldom performed with radon  and as a result there are very few reported compounds of radon  all either fluorides or oxides  Radon can be oxidized by a few powerful oxidizing agents such as fluorine  thus forming radon difluoride  It decomposes back to elements at a temperature of above 250 °C  It has a low volatility and was thought to be   But because of the short half life of radon and the radioactivity of its compounds  it has not been possible to study the compound in any detail  Theoretical studies on this molecule predict that it should have a Rn–F bond distance of 2 08 Å  and that the compound is thermodynamically more stable and less volatile than its lighter counterpart   The octahedral molecule was predicted to have an even lower enthalpy of formation than the difluoride  The higher fluorides RnF4 and RnF6 have been claimed to exist  and are calculated to be stable  but it is doubtful whether they have actually been synthesized  The  RnF + ion is believed to form by the following reaction   Radon oxides are among the few other reported   only the trioxide has been confirmed  Radon carbonyl RnCO has been predicted to be stable and to have a linear molecular geometry  The molecules and RnXe were found to be significantly stabilized by spin orbit coupling  Radon caged inside a fullerene has been proposed as a drug for tumors  Despite the existence of Xe VIII   no Rn VIII  compounds have been claimed to exist  RnF8 should be highly unstable chemically  XeF8 is thermodynamically unstable   It is predicted that the most stable Rn VIII  compound would be barium perradate  Ba2RnO6   analogous to barium perxenate  The instability of Rn VIII  is due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s shell  also known as the inert pair effect   1 3  Isotopes  Radon has no stable isotopes  However  36 radioactive isotopes have been characterized  with their atomic masses ranging from 193 to 228  The most stable isotope is 222Rn  which is a decay product of 226Ra  a decay product of 238U  A very trace amount of the  highly unstable  isotope 218Rn is also among the daughters of 222Rn   There are three other radon isotopes that have a half life of over an hour  211Rn  210Rn and 224Rn  The 220Rn isotope is a natural decay product of the most stable thorium isotope  232Th   and is commonly referred to as thoron  It has a half life of 55 6 seconds and also emits alpha radiation  Similarly  219Rn is derived from the most stable isotope of actinium  227Ac —named  actinon —and is an alpha emitter with a half life of 3 96 seconds  No radon isotopes occur significantly in the neptunium  237Np  decay series  though a trace amount of the  extremely unstable  isotope 217Rn is produced   1 3 1  Progenies  222Rn belongs to the radium and uranium 238 decay chain  and has a half life of 3 8235 days  Its four first products  excluding marginal decay schemes  are very short lived  meaning that the corresponding disintegrations are indicative of the initial radon distribution  Its decay goes through the following sequence   222Rn  3 8 days  alpha decaying to     218Po  3 10 minutes  alpha decaying to     214Pb  26 8 minutes  beta decaying to     214Bi  19 9 minutes  beta decaying to     214Po  0 1643 ms  alpha decaying to     210Pb  which has a much longer half life of 22 3 years  beta decaying to     210Bi  5 013 days  beta decaying to     210Po  138 376 days  alpha decaying to     206Pb  stable  The radon equilibrium factor is the ratio between the activity of all short period radon progenies  which are responsible for most of radon s biological effects   and the activity that would be at equilibrium with the radon parent   If a closed volume is constantly supplied with radon  the concentration of short lived isotopes will increase until an equilibrium is reached where the rate of decay of each decay product will equal that of the radon itself  The equilibrium factor is 1 when both activities are equal  meaning that the decay products have stayed close to the radon parent long enough for the equilibrium to be reached  within a couple of hours  Under these conditions each additional pCi L of radon will increase exposure  by 0 01 WL  see explanation of WL below   These conditions are not always met  in many homes  the equilibrium fraction is typically 40%  that is  there will be 0 004 WL of progeny for each pCi L of radon in air  210Pb takes much longer  decades  to come in equilibrium with radon  but  if the environment permits accumulation of dust over extended periods of time  210Pb and its decay products may contribute to overall radiation levels as well   Because of their electrostatic charge  radon progenies adhere to surfaces or dust particles  whereas gaseous radon does not  Attachment removes them from the air  usually causing the equilibrium factor in the atmosphere to be less than one  The equilibrium factor is also lowered by air circulation or air filtration devices  and is increased by airborne dust particles  including cigarette smoke  In high concentrations  airborne radon isotopes contribute significantly to human health risk  The equilibrium factor found in epidemiological studies is 0 4   2  History and etymology  Radon was the fifth radioactive element to be discovered  in 1900 by Friedrich Ernst Dorn  after uranium  thorium  radium and polonium  In 1900 Dorn reported some experiments in which he noticed that radium compounds emanate a radioactive gas he named Radium Emanation  Ra Em   Before that  in 1899  Pierre and Marie Curie observed that the gas emitted by radium remained radioactive for a month  Later that year  Robert B  Owens and Ernest Rutherford  at McGill University in Montreal  noticed variations when trying to measure radiation from thorium oxide  Rutherford noticed that the compounds of thorium continuously emit a radioactive gas that retains the radioactive powers for several minutes  and called this gas emanation  from Latin  emanare —to elapse and  emanatio —expiration   and later Thorium Emanation  Th Em   In 1901  he demonstrated that the emanations are radioactive  but credited the Curies for the discovery of the element  In 1903  similar emanations were observed from actinium by André Louis Debierne and were called Actinium Emanation  Ac Em    Several names were suggested for these three gases  exradio  exthorio  and exactinio in 1904  radon  thoron  and akton in 1918  radeon  thoreon  and actineon in 1919  and eventually radon  thoron  and actinon in 1920  The likeness of the spectra of these three gases with those of argon  krypton  and xenon  and their observed chemical inertia led Sir William Ramsay to suggest in 1904 that the  emanations  might contain a new element of the noble gas family   In 1910  Sir William Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw Gray isolated radon  determined its density  and determined that it was the heaviest known gas  They wrote that  L expression de l émanation du radium est fort incommode    the expression  radium emanation  is very awkward  and suggested the new name niton  Nt   from the Latin  nitens  meaning  shining   to emphasize the radioluminescence property  and in 1912 it was accepted by the International Commission for Atomic Weights  In 1923  the International Committee for Chemical Elements and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry  IUPAC  chose among the names radon  Rn   thoron  Tn   and actinon  An   Later  when isotopes were numbered instead of named  the element took the name of the most stable isotope  radon  while Tn was renamed 220Rn and An was renamed 219Rn  As late as the 1960s  the element was also referred to simply as emanation  The first synthesized compound of radon  radon fluoride  was obtained in 1962   The danger of high exposure to radon in mines  where exposures reaching 1 000 000 Bq m3 can be found  has long been known  In 1530  Paracelsus described a wasting disease of miners  the mala metallorum  and Georg Agricola recommended ventilation in mines to avoid this mountain sickness  Bergsucht   In 1879  this condition was identified as lung cancer by Herting and Hesse in their investigation of miners from Schneeberg  Germany  The first major studies with radon and health occurred in the context of uranium mining in the Joachimsthal region of Bohemia  In the US  studies and mitigation only followed decades of health effects on uranium miners of the Southwestern United States employed during the early Cold War  standards were not implemented until 1971   The presence of radon in indoor air was documented as early as 1950  Beginning in the 1970s research was initiated to address sources of indoor radon  determinants of concentration  health effects  and approaches to mitigation  In the United States  the problem of indoor radon received widespread publicity and intensified investigation after a widely publicized incident in 1984  During routine monitoring at a Pennsylvania nuclear power plant  a worker was found to be contaminated with radioactivity  A high contamination of radon in his home was subsequently identified as responsible for the contamination   3  Occurrence  3 1  Concentration units  All discussions of radon concentrations in the environment refer to 222Rn  While the average rate of production of 220Rn  from the thorium decay series  is about the same as 222Rn  the amount of 220Rn in the environment is much less than that of 222Rn because of the short half life of 220Rn  55 seconds  versus 3 8 days respectively    Radon concentration in the atmosphere is usually measured in becquerel per cubic meter  Bq m3   the SI derived unit  Another unit of measurement common in the USA is picocuries per liter  pCi L   1 pCi L 37 Bq m3  Typical domestic exposures average about 48 Bq m3 indoors  though this varies widely  and 15 Bq m3 outdoors   In the mining industry  the exposition is traditionally measured in working level  WL   and the cumulative exposition in working level month  WLM   1 WL equals any combination of short lived 222Rn progeny  218Po  214Pb  214Bi  and 214Po  in 1 liter of air that releases 1 3 × 105 MeV of potential alpha energy  one WL is equivalent to 2 08 × 10−5 joules per cubic meter of air  J m3   The SI unit of cumulative exposure is expressed in joule hours per cubic meter  J·h m3   One WLM is equivalent to 3 6 × 10−3 J·h m3  An exposure to 1 WL for 1 working month  170 hours  equals 1 WLM cumulative exposure  A cumulative exposure of 1 WLM is roughly equivalent to living one year in an atmosphere with a radon concentration of 230 Bq m3   Radon  222Rn   when released into the air  decays to 210Pb and other radioisotopes  The levels of 210Pb can be measured  The rate of deposition of this radioisotope is weather dependent   Radon concentrations found in natural environments are much too low to be detected by chemical means  A 1000 Bq m3  relatively high  concentration corresponds to 0 17 picogram per cubic meter  The average concentration of radon in the atmosphere is about 6 atoms of radon for each molecule in the air  or about 150 atoms in each ml of air  The radon activity of the entire Earth s atmosphere originates from only a few tens of grams of radon  consistently replaced by decay of larger amounts of radium and uranium   3 2  Natural  Radon is produced by the radioactive decay of radium 226  which is found in uranium ores  phosphate rock  shales  igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite  gneiss  and schist  and  to a lesser degree  in common rocks such as limestone  Every square mile of surface soil  to a depth of 6 inches  2 6 km2 to a depth of 15 cm   contains approximately 1 gram of radium  which releases radon in small amounts to the atmosphere On a global scale  it is estimated that 2 400 million curies  90 TBq  of radon are released from soil annually   Radon concentration varies widely from place to place  In the open air  it ranges from 1 to 100 Bq m3  even less  0 1 Bq m3  above the ocean  In caves or aerated mines  or ill aerated houses  its concentration climbs to 20–2 000 Bq m3  Radon concentration can be much higher in mining contexts  Ventilation regulations instruct to maintain radon concentration in uranium mines under the  working level   with 95th percentile levels ranging up to nearly 3 WL  546 pCi 222Rn per liter of air  20 2 kBq m3  measured from 1976 to 1985   The concentration in the air at the  unventilated  Gastein Healing Gallery averages 43 kBq m3  1 2 nCi L  with maximal value of 160 kBq m3  4 3 nCi L    Radon mostly appears with the decay chain of the radium and uranium series  222Rn   and marginally with the thorium series  220Rn   The element emanates naturally from the ground  and some building materials  all over the world  wherever traces of uranium or thorium can be found  and particularly in regions with soils containing granite or shale  which have a higher concentration of uranium  However  not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon  Being a rare gas  it usually migrates freely through faults and fragmented soils  and may accumulate in caves or water  Owing to its very short half life  four days for 222Rn   radon concentration decreases very quickly when the distance from the production area increases  Radon concentration varies greatly with season and atmospheric conditions  For instance  it has been shown to accumulate in the air if there is a meteorological inversion and little wind   High concentrations of radon can be found in some spring waters and hot springs  The towns of Boulder  Montana  Misasa  Bad Kreuznach  Germany  and the country of Japan have radium rich springs that emit radon  To be classified as a radon mineral water  radon concentration must be above a minimum of 2 nCi L  74 kBq m3   The activity of radon mineral water reaches 2 000 kBq m3 in Merano and 4 000 kBq m3 in Lurisia  Italy    Natural radon concentrations in the Earth s atmosphere are so low that radon rich water in contact with the atmosphere will continually lose radon by volatilization  Hence  ground water has a higher concentration of 222Rn than surface water  because radon is continuously produced by radioactive decay of 226Ra present in rocks  Likewise  the saturated zone of a soil frequently has a higher radon content than the unsaturated zone because of diffusional losses to the atmosphere   In 1971  Apollo 15 passed 110 km  68 mi  above the Aristarchus plateau on the Moon  and detected a significant rise in alpha particles thought to be caused by the decay of 222Rn  The presence of 222Rn has been inferred later from data obtained from the Lunar Prospector alpha particle spectrometer   Radon is found in some petroleum  Because radon has a similar pressure and temperature curve to propane  and oil refineries separate petrochemicals based on their boiling points  the piping carrying freshly separated propane in oil refineries can become radioactive because of decaying radon and its products   Residues from the petroleum and natural gas industry often contain radium and its daughters  The sulfate scale from an oil well can be radium rich  while the water  oil  and gas from a well often contains radon  Radon decays to form solid radioisotopes that form coatings on the inside of pipework   3 3  Accumulation in houses  High concentrations of radon in homes were discovered by chance in 1985 after the stringent radiation testing conducted at a nuclear power plant entrance revealed that Stanley Watras  an engineer entering the plant  was contaminated by radioactive substances  Typical domestic exposures are of approximately 100 Bq m3  1 3 pC L  indoors  Some level of radon will be found in all homes  Radon mostly enters a home directly from the soil through the lowest level in the home that is in contact with the ground  High levels of radon in the water supply can also increase indoor radon air levels  Typical entry points of radon into homes are cracks in solid foundations  construction joints  cracks in walls  gaps in suspended floors  gaps around service pipes  cavities inside walls  and the water supply  Radon concentrations in the same location may differ by a factor of two over a period of 1 hour  Also  the concentration in one room of a building may be significantly different from the concentration in an adjoining room   The distribution of radon concentrations will generally change from room to room  and the readings are averaged according to regulatory protocols  Indoor radon concentration is usually assumed to follow a lognormal distribution on a given territory  Thus  the geometric mean is generally used for estimating the  average  radon concentration in an area   The mean concentration ranges from less than 10 Bq m3 to over 100 Bq m3 in some European countries  Typical geometric standard deviations found in studies range between 2 and 3  meaning  given the 68–95–99 7 rule  that the radon concentration is expected to be more than a hundred times the mean concentration for 2 to 3% of the cases   The highest average radon concentrations in the United States are found in Iowa and in the Appalachian Mountain areas in southeastern Pennsylvania  Some of the highest readings ever have been recorded in the Irish town of Mallow  County Cork  prompting local fears regarding lung cancer  Iowa has the highest average radon concentrations in the United States due to significant glaciation that ground the granitic rocks from the Canadian Shield and deposited it as soils making up the rich Iowa farmland  Many cities within the state  such as Iowa City  have passed requirements for radon resistant construction in new homes   In a few locations  uranium tailings have been used for landfills and were subsequently built on  resulting in possible increased exposure to radon   Since radon is a colorless  odorless gas the only way to know how much is present in the air or water is to perform tests  In the United States radon test kits are available to the public at retail stores  such as hardware stores  for home use and testing is available through licensed professionals  who are often home inspectors  Efforts to reduce indoor radon levels are called radon mitigation  In the U S  the Environmental Protection Agency recommends all houses be tested for radon   3 4  Industrial production  Radon is obtained as a by product of uraniferous ores processing after transferring into 1% solutions of hydrochloric or hydrobromic acids  The gas mixture extracted from the solutions contains     He  Rn    and hydrocarbons  The mixture is purified by passing it over copper at 720 °C to remove the and the   and then KOH and are used to remove the acids and moisture by sorption  Radon is condensed by liquid nitrogen and purified from residue gases by sublimation   Radon commercialization is regulated  but it is available in small quantities for the calibration of 222Rn measurement systems  at a price of almost $6 000 per milliliter of radium solution  which only contains about 15 picograms of actual radon at a given moment   Radon is produced by a solution of radium 226  half life of 1600 years   Radium 226 decays by alpha particle emission  producing radon that collects over samples of radium 226 at a rate of about 1 mm3 day per gram of radium  equilibrium is quickly achieved and radon is produced in a steady flow  with an activity equal to that of the radium  50 Bq   Gaseous 222Rn  half life of about four days  escapes from the capsule through diffusion   3 5  Concentration scale  4  Applications  4 1  Medical  An early 20th century form of quackery was the treatment of maladies in a radiotorium  It was a small  sealed room for patients to be exposed to radon for its  medicinal effects   The carcinogenic nature of radon due to its ionizing radiation became apparent later on  Radon s molecule damaging radioactivity has been used to kill cancerous cells  It does not  however  increase the health of healthy cells  In fact  the ionizing radiation causes the formation of free radicals  which results in genetic and other cell damage  resulting in increased rates of illness  including cancer   Exposure to radon  a process known as radiation hormesis  has been suggested to mitigate auto immune diseases such as arthritis  As a result  in the late 20th century and early 21st century   health mines  established in Basin  Montana attracted people seeking relief from health problems such as arthritis through limited exposure to radioactive mine water and radon  However  the practice is discouraged because of the well documented ill effects of high doses of radiation on the body   Radioactive water baths have been applied since 1906 in Jáchymov  Czech Republic  but even before radon discovery they were used in Bad Gastein  Austria  Radium rich springs are also used in traditional Japanese onsen in Misasa  Tottori Prefecture  Drinking therapy is applied in Bad Brambach  Germany  Inhalation therapy is carried out in Gasteiner Heilstollen  Austria  in Świeradów Zdrój  Czerniawa Zdrój  Kowary  Lądek Zdrój  Poland  in Harghita Băi  Romania  and in Boulder  United States  In the United States and Europe there are several  radon spas   where people sit for minutes or hours in a high radon atmosphere in the belief that low doses of radiation will invigorate or energize them   Radon has been produced commercially for use in radiation therapy  but for the most part has been replaced by radionuclides made in accelerators and nuclear reactors  Radon has been used in implantable seeds  made of gold or glass  primarily used to treat cancers  The gold seeds were produced by filling a long tube with radon pumped from a radium source  the tube being then divided into short sections by crimping and cutting  The gold layer keeps the radon within  and filters out the alpha and beta radiations  while allowing the gamma rays to escape  which kill the diseased tissue   The activities might range from 0 05 to 5 millicuries per seed  2 to 200 MBq   The gamma rays are produced by radon and the first short lived elements of its decay chain  218Po  214Pb  214Bi  214Po    Radon and its first decay products being very short lived  the seed is left in place  After 12 half lives  43 days   radon radioactivity is at 1 2000 of its original level  At this stage  the predominant residual activity originates from the radon decay product 210Pb  whose half life  22 3 years  is 2000 times that of radon  and whose activity is thus 1 2000 of radon s   and its descendants 210Bi and 210Po   In the early part of the 20th century in the USA  gold contaminated with 210Pb entered the jewelry industry  This was from gold seeds that had held 222Rn that had been melted down after the radon had decayed   4 2  Scientific  Radon emanation from the soil varies with soil type and with surface uranium content  so outdoor radon concentrations can be used to track air masses to a limited degree  This fact has been put to use by some atmospheric scientists  Because of radon s rapid loss to air and comparatively rapid decay  radon is used in hydrologic research that studies the interaction between ground water and streams  Any significant concentration of radon in a stream is a good indicator that there are local inputs of ground water   Radon soil concentration has been used in an experimental way to map buried close subsurface geological faults because concentrations are generally higher over the faults  Similarly  it has found some limited use in prospecting for geothermal gradients   Some researchers have investigated changes in groundwater radon concentrations for earthquake prediction  Radon has a half life of approximately 3 8 days  which means that it can be found only shortly after it has been produced in the radioactive decay chain  For this reason  it has been hypothesized that increases in radon concentration is due to the generation of new cracks underground  which would allow increased ground water circulation  flushing out radon  The generation of new cracks might not unreasonably be assumed to precede major earthquakes  In the 1970s and 1980s  scientific measurements of radon emissions near faults found that earthquakes often occurred with no radon signal  and radon was often detected with no earthquake to follow  It was then dismissed by many as an unreliable indicator  However  as of 2009  it is under investigation as a possible precursor by NASA   Radon is a known pollutant emitted from geothermal power stations because it is present in the material pumped from deep underground  However  it disperses rapidly  and no radiological hazard has been demonstrated in various investigations  In addition  typical systems re inject the material deep underground rather that releasing it at the surface  so its environmental impact is minimal   In the 1940s and 50s  radon was used for industrial radiography  Other X ray sources  which became available after World War II  quickly replaced radon for this application  as they were lower in cost and had less hazard of alpha radiation   5  Health risks  5 1  In mines  Radon 222  actually radon progeny  has been classified by International Agency for Research on Cancer as being carcinogenic to humans  and as a gas that can be inhaled  lung cancer is a particular concern for people exposed to high levels of radon for sustained periods of time  During the 1940s and 50s  when safety standards requiring expensive ventilation in mines were not widely implemented  radon exposure was linked to lung cancer among non smoking miners of uranium and other hard rock materials in what is now the Czech Republic  and later among miners from the Southwestern United States   Since that time  ventilation and other measures have been used to reduce radon levels in most affected mines that continue to operate  In recent years  the average annual exposure of uranium miners has fallen to levels similar to the concentrations inhaled in some homes  This has reduced the risk of occupationally induced cancer from radon  although health issues may persist for those who are currently employed in affected mines and for those who have been employed in them in the past  As the relative risk for miners has decreased  so has the ability to detect excess risks among that population   In addition to lung cancer  researchers have theorized a possible increased risk of leukemia due to radon exposure  Empirical support from studies of the general population is inconsistent  However  a study of uranium miners found a noticeable correlation between radon exposure and chronic lymphocytic leukemia   5 2  Domestic level exposure  Radon exposure  actually radon progeny  has been linked to lung cancer in numerous case control studies performed in the United States  Europe and China  There are approximately 21 000 deaths per year in the USA due to radon induced lung cancers  One of the most comprehensive radon studies performed in the United States by Dr  R  William Field and colleagues found a 50% increased lung cancer risk even at the protracted exposures at the EPA s action level of 4 pCi L  North American and European Pooled analyses further support these findings   Most models of residential radon exposure are based on studies of miners  and direct estimates of the risks posed to homeowners would be more desirable  Nonetheless  because of the difficulties of measuring the risk of radon relative to other contributors—namely smoking—models of their effect have often made use of them   Radon has been considered the second leading cause of lung cancer and leading environmental cause of cancer mortality by the United States Environmental Protection Agency  Others have reached similar conclusions for the United Kingdom and France  Radon exposure in homes and offices may arise from certain subsurface rock formations  and also from certain building materials  e g   some granites   The greatest risk of radon exposure arises in buildings that are airtight  insufficiently ventilated  and have foundation leaks that allow air from the soil into basements and dwelling rooms   5 3  Action and reference level  WHO presented in 2009 a recommended reference level  the national reference level   100 Bq m3  for radon in dwellings  The recommendation also says that where this is not possible  300 Bq m3 should be selected as the highest level  A national reference level should not be a limit  but should represent the maximum acceptable annual average radon concentration in a dwelling   The actionable concentration of radon in a home varies depending on the organization doing the recommendation  for example  the United States Environmental Protection Agency encourages that action be taken at concentrations as low as 74 Bq m3  2 pCi L   and the European Union recommends action be taken when concentrations reach 400 Bq m3  11 pCi L  for old houses and 200 Bq m3  5 pCi L  for new ones  On 8 July 2010 the UK s Health Protection Agency issued new advice setting a  Target Level  of 100 Bq m3 whilst retaining an  Action Level  of 200 Bq m3  The same levels  as UK  applies to Norway from 2010  all new housings should be radon shielded   5 4  Relationship to smoking  Results from epidemiological studies indicate that the risk of lung cancer increases with exposure to residential radon  However  there are always major uncertainties in these studies  A classical and well known example of source of error is smoking  In addition  smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer  In the West  tobacco smoke is estimated to cause about 90% of all lung cancers  There is a tendency for other hypothetical lung cancer risks to drown in the risk of smoking  Results from epidemiological studies must always be interpreted with caution   According to the EPA  the risk of lung cancer for smokers is significant due to synergistic effects of radon and smoking  For this population about 62 people in a total of 1 000 will die of lung cancer compared to 7 people in a total of 1 000 for people who have never smoked  It can  however  not be excluded that the risk of non smokers should be primarily explained by a combination effect of radon and passive smoking  see below    Radon  like other known or suspected external risk factors for lung cancer  is a threat for smokers and former smokers  This was clearly demonstrated by the European pooling study  A commentary to the pooling study stated   it is not appropriate to talk simply of a risk from radon in homes  The risk is from smoking  compounded by a synergistic effect of radon for smokers  Without smoking  the effect seems to be so small as to be insignificant    According to the European pooling study  there is a difference in risk from radon between histological types  Small cell lung carcinoma  which practically only affects smokers have high risk from radon  For other histological types such as adenocarcinoma  the type that primarily affects never smokers  the risk from radon appears to be lower   A study of radiation from post mastectomy radiotherapy shows that the simple models previously used to assess the combined and separate risks from radiation and smoking need to be developed  This is also supported by new discussion about the calculation method  LNT  which routinely has been used   5 5  Relationship to passive smoking  An important question is if also passive smoking can cause a similar synergy effect with residential radon  This has been insufficiently studied  The basic data for the European pooling study makes it impossible to exclude that such synergy effect is an explanation for the  very limited  increase in the risk from radon that was stated for non smokers   A study from 2001  which included 436 cases  never smokers who had lung cancer   and a control group  1649 never smokers  showed that exposure to radon increased the risk of lung cancer in never smokers  But the group that had been exposed to passive smoking at home appeared to bear the entire risk increase  while those who were not exposed to passive smoking did not show any increased risk with increasing radon level   5 6  In drinking water  The effects of radon if ingested are similarly unknown  although studies have found that its biological half life ranges from 30–70 minutes  with 90 percent removal at 100 minutes  In 1999 National Research Council investigated the issue of radon in drinking water  The risks associated with ingestion was considered almost negligible  Water from underground sources may contain significant amounts of radon depending on the surrounding rock and soil conditions  whereas surface sources generally do not   As well as being ingested through drinking water  radon is also released from water when temperature is increased  pressure is decreased and when water is aerated  Optimum conditions for radon release and exposure occur during showering  Water with a radon concentration of 104 pCi L can increase the indoor airborne radon concentration by 1 pCi L under normal conditions of water use   5 7  Testing and mitigation  There are relatively simple tests for radon gas  In some countries these tests are methodically done in areas of known systematic hazards  Radon detection devices are commercially available  The short term radon test devices used for screening purposes are inexpensive  in some cases free  There are very important protocols for taking short term radon tests and it is imperative that they be strictly followed  The kit includes a collector that the user hangs in the lowest livable floor of the house for 2 to 7 days  The user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis  Long term kits  taking collections for up to one year  are also available  An open land test kit can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins   Radon levels fluctuate naturally  due to factors like transient weather conditions  so an initial test might not be an accurate assessment of a home s average radon level  Radon levels are at a maximum during the coolest part of the day when pressure differentials are greatest  Therefore  a high result  over 4 pCi L  justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement projects  Measurements between 4 and 10 pCi L warrant a long term radon test  Measurements over 10 pCi L warrant only another short term test so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed  Purchasers of real estate are advised to delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to 4 pCi L or less   Because the half life of radon is only 3 8 days  removing or isolating the source will greatly reduce the hazard within a few weeks  Another method of reducing radon levels is to modify the building s ventilation  Generally  the indoor radon concentrations increase as ventilation rates decrease  In a well ventilated place  the radon concentration tends to align with outdoor values  typically 10 Bq m3  ranging from 1 to 100 Bq m3    Radon levels in indoor air can be lowered in a number of ways  from sub slab depressurization to increasing the ventilation rate of the building  The four principal ways of reducing the amount of radon accumulating in a house are  Sub slab depressurization  soil suction  by increasing under floor ventilation   Improving the ventilation of the house and avoiding the transport of radon from the basement into living rooms   Installing a radon sump system in the basement   Installing a positive pressurization or positive supply ventilation system  According to the EPA the method to reduce radon     primarily used is a vent pipe system and fan  which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside   which is also called sub slab depressurization  active soil depressurization  or soil suction  Generally indoor radon can be mitigated by sub slab depressurization and exhausting such radon laden air to the outdoors  away from windows and other building openings   EPA generally recommends methods which prevent the entry of radon  Soil suction  for example  prevents radon from entering your home by drawing the radon from below the home and venting it through a pipe  or pipes  to the air above the home where it is quickly diluted  and  EPA does not recommend the use of sealing alone to reduce radon because  by itself  sealing has not been shown to lower radon levels significantly or consistently    Positive pressure ventilation systems can be combined with a heat exchanger to recover energy in the process of exchanging air with the outside  and simply exhausting basement air to the outside is not necessarily a viable solution as this can actually draw radon gas into a dwelling  Homes built on a crawl space may benefit from a radon collector installed under a  radon barrier   a sheet of plastic that covers the crawl space   For crawlspaces  the EPA states  An effective method to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes involves covering the earth floor with a high density plastic sheet  A vent pipe and fan are used to draw the radon from under the sheet and vent it to the outdoors  This form of soil suction is called submembrane suction  and when properly applied is the most effective way to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes    6  See also  International Radon Project  Lucas cell  Radiation Exposure Compensation Act
