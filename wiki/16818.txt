The kora is a 21 string lute bridge harp used extensively in West Africa   1  Description  A kora is a harp built from a large calabash cut in half and covered with cow skin to make a resonator with a long hardwood neck  The skin is supported by two handles that run under it  and it supports a notched double free standing bridge  It doesn t fit into any one category of musical instruments  but rather several  and must be classified as a  double bridge harp lute   The strings run in two divided ranks  making it a double harp  They do not end in a soundboard but are held in notches on a bridge  making it a bridge harp  They originate from a string arm or neck and cross a bridge directly supported by a resonating chamber  making it a lute too   The sound of a kora resembles that of a harp  though when played in the traditional style  it bears a closer resemblance to flamenco and delta bluesblues guitar techniques  The player uses only the thumb and index finger of both hands to pluck the strings in polyrhythmic patterns  using the remaining fingers to secure the instrument by holding the hand posts on either side of the strings   Ostinato riffs   Kumbengo   and improvised solo runs   Birimintingo   are played at the same time by skilled players   Kora players have traditionally come from griot families  also from the Mandinka nationalities  who are traditional historians  genealogists and storytellers who pass their skills on to their descendants  The instrument is played in Guinea  Guinea Bissau  Mali  Senegal  Burkina Faso and the Gambia  A traditional kora player is called a Jali  similar to a  bard  or oral historian  Most West African musicians prefer the term  jali  to  griot   which is the French word   Traditional koras feature 21 strings  eleven played by the left hand and ten by the right  Modern koras made in the Casamance region of southern Senegal sometimes feature additional bass strings  adding up to four strings to the traditional 21  Strings were traditionally made from thin strips of hide  for example antelope skin   now most strings are made from harp strings or nylon fishing line  sometimes plaited together to create thicker strings   By moving leather tuning rings up and down the neck  a kora player can retune the instrument into one of four seven note scales  These scales are close in tuning to western major  minor and Lydian modes   2  History  The earliest European reference to the kora in Western literature is in Travels in Interior Districts of Africa  1799  by the Scottish explorer Mungo Park  The most likely scenario  based on Mandinka oral tradition  suggests that the origins of the Kora may ultimately be linked with Jali Mady Fouling Cissoko  some time after the founding of Kaabu in the 16th century   The kora is mentioned in the Senegalese national anthem  Pincez Tous vos Koras  Frappez les Balafons    Nowadays  increasingly  koras are made with guitar machine heads instead of the traditional leather rings  The advantage is that they are much easier to tune  The disadvantage is that this design limits the pitch of the instrument because string lengths are more fixed and lighter strings are needed to lift it much more than a tone  Learning to tune a traditional kora is arguably as difficult as learning to play it  and many people entranced by the sound while in Africa buy a kora and then find themselves unable to keep it in tune once they are home  relegating it to the status of ornament  Koras can be converted to replace the leather rings with machine heads  Wooden pegs and harp pegs are also used  but both can still cause tuning problems in damper climates unless made with great skill   In the late 20th century  a 25 string model of the kora was developed  though it has been adopted by only a few players  primarily in the region of Casamance  in southern Senegal  Some kora players such as Seckou Keita have double necked koras  allowing them to switch from one tuning to another within seconds  giving them increased flexibility   The French Benedictine monks of the Keur Moussa Abbey  Senegal   who possibly were the first to introduce guitar machine heads instead of leather rings in the late seventies  conceived a method based on scores to teach the instrument  Brother Dominique Catta  choirmaster of the Keur Moussa Abbey  was the first Western composer who wrote for the kora  solo pieces as well as duets with Western instruments    An electric instrument modeled on the kora  but made primarily of metal  called the gravikord was invented in the late 20th century by instrument builder and musician Robert Grawi  It has 24 strings but is tuned and played differently than the kora  Another instrument  the Gravi kora  a 21 string electro acoustic instrument  was later developed by Robert Grawi especially for kora players who wanted a modern instrument  Its playing and tuning are the same as the traditional kora  The gravi kora has been adopted by kora players such as Daniel Berkman  Jacques Burtin  and Foday Musa Suso  who featured it in recordings with jazz innovator Herbie Hancock  with his band Mandingo  and on Suso s New World Power album   3  Scores  The kora music being part of the oral tradition  its music was not written until the 20th century  The ethnomusicologists were the only ones to note some traditional airs in the normal grand staff method using the G clef and the F clef   Nowadays  kora scores are written on a single G clef  following the Keur Moussa notation system  This notation system was created for the kora in the late 1970s by Brother Dominique Catta  a monk of the Keur Moussa Monastery  Senegal   The seven low notes that should be written on the F clef are replaced by Arabic or Roman numerals and written on the G clef   While griots still compose in the traditional way  without writing scores   some Western musicians began to write partitures for the kora and adopted the Keur Moussa notation system at the beginning of the 1980s  More than 200 scores have already been written for kora solo or kora and Western instruments  Two notable Western composers for the kora are Brother Dominique Catta and Jacques Burtin  France   who wrote most of these scores  though composers like Carole Ouellet  Canada   Brother Grégoire Philippe  Monastère de Keur Moussa  and Sister Claire Marie Ledoux  France  contributed with original works   4  Bibliography  Eric Charry  Mande Music   Traditional and Modern Music of the Maninka and Mandinka of Western Africa  University of
