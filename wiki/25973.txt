The Red Army Faction  RAF  German  Rote Armee Fraktion   in its early stages commonly known as the Baader Meinhof Group  or the Baader Meinhof Gang   was a West German far left militant group  The RAF was founded in 1970 by Andreas Baader  Gudrun Ensslin  Horst Mahler  and Ulrike Meinhof  The RAF described itself as a communist and anti imperialist  urban guerrilla  group engaged in armed resistance against what they deemed to be a fascist state  As such  members of the RAF generally used the Marxist–Leninist term  Faction  when they wrote in English  The West German government considered the Red Army Faction to be a terrorist organization   The Red Army Faction existed from 1970 to 1998  committing numerous operations  especially in late 1977  which led to a national crisis that became known as  German Autumn   It was held responsible for thirty four deaths  including many secondary targets  such as chauffeurs and bodyguards  and many injuries in its almost thirty years of activity  Although better known  the RAF conducted fewer attacks than the Revolutionary Cells  German  Revolutionäre Zellen  RZ   which is held responsible for 296 bomb attacks  arson and other attacks between 1973 and 1995   Although Meinhof was not considered to be a leader of the RAF at any time  her involvement in Baader s escape from jail in 1970 and her well known status as a German journalist led to her name becoming attached to it  There were three successive incarnations of the organization   the  first generation  which consisted of Baader and his associates   the  second generation  RAF  which operated in the mid to late 1970s after several former members of the Socialist Patients  Collective joined  and  the  third generation  RAF  which existed in the 1980s and 1990s  On 20 April 1998  an eight page typewritten letter in German was faxed to the Reuters news agency  signed  RAF  with the submachine gun red star  declaring that the group had dissolved   1  Background  The origins of the group can be traced back to the student protest movement in West Germany  Industrialised nations in the late 1960s experienced social upheavals related to the maturing of the  baby boomers   to the Cold War  and the end of colonialism  Newly found youth identity and issues such as racism  women s liberation and anti imperialism were at the forefront of left wing politics   Many young people were alienated from both their parents and the institutions of state  The historical legacy of Nazism drove a wedge between the generations and increased suspicion of authoritarian structures in society  some analysts see the same occurring in post fascism Italy  giving rise to  Brigate Rosse     In West Germany there was anger among leftist youth at the post war denazification in West and East Germany  which was perceived as a failure or as ineffective  as former  actual and supposed  Nazis held positions in government and economy  The Communist Party of Germany had been outlawed since 1956  Elected and unelected government positions down to the local level were often occupied by ex Nazis  Konrad Adenauer  the first Federal Republic chancellor  in office 1949–1963   had even appointed the former Nazi sympathiser Hans Globke as Director of the Federal Chancellery of West Germany  in office 1953–1963    The radicals regarded the conservative media as biased   at the time conservatives such as Axel Springer  who was implacably opposed to student radicalism  owned and controlled the conservative media including all of the most influential mass circulation tabloid newspapers  1966 saw the emergence of the Grand Coalition between the two main parties  the SPD and CDU  with former Nazi Party member Kurt Georg Kiesinger as chancellor  This horrified many on the left and was viewed as monolithic  political marriage of convenience with pro NATO  pro capitalist collusion on the part of the social democratic SPD  With ninety five percent of the Bundestag controlled by the coalition  an Extra Parliamentary Opposition  APO  was formed with the intent of generating protest and political activity outside of government  In 1972 a law was passed  the Radikalenerlass  which banned radicals or those with a  questionable  political persuasion from public sector jobs   Some radicals used the supposed association of large parts of society with Nazism as an argument against any peaceful approaches   The radicalized were  like many in the New Left  influenced by   Sociological developments  pressure within the educational system in and outside Europe and the U S   together with the background of counter cultural movements   The writings of Mao Zedong adapted to Western European conditions   Post war writings on class society and empire as well as contemporary Marxist critiques from many revolutionaries such as Frantz Fanon  Ho Chi Minh  and Che Guevara  as well as early Autonomism   Philosophers associated with the Frankfurt school  Jürgen Habermas  Herbert Marcuse  and Oskar Negt in particular  and associated Marxian philosophers  RAF founder Ulrike Meinhof had a long history in the Communist Party  Holger Meins had studied film and was a veteran of the Berlin revolt  his short feature How To Produce A Molotov Cocktail was seen by huge audiences  Jan Carl Raspe lived at the Kommune 2  Horst Mahler was an established lawyer  but was also at the center of the anti Springer revolt from the beginning  From their own personal experiences and assessments of the socio economic situation they soon became more specifically influenced by Leninism and Maoism  calling themselves  Marxist Leninist  though they effectively added to or updated this ideological tradition  A contemporaneous critique of the Red Army Faction s view of the state  published in a pirate edition of Le Monde Diplomatique  ascribed to it  state fetishism  – an ideologically obsessive misreading of bourgeois dynamics and the nature and role of the state in post WWII societies  including West Germany   It is claimed that property destruction during the Watts Riots in the United States in 1965 influenced the practical and ideological approach of the RAF founders as well as some of those in Situationist circles   The writings of Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse were drawn upon  Gramsci wrote on power  cultural and ideological conflicts in society and institutions—real time class struggles playing out in rapidly developing industrial nation states through interlinked areas of political behaviour  Marcuse on coercion and hegemony in that cultural indoctrination and ideological manipulation through the means of communication   repressive tolerance   dispensed with the need for complete brute force in modern  liberal democracies   His One Dimensional Man was addressed to the restive students of the sixties  Marcuse argued that only marginal groups of students and poor alienated workers could effectively resist the system  Both Gramsci and Marcuse came to the conclusion that the ideological underpinnings and the  superstructure  of society was vitally important in the understanding of class control  and acquiescence   This could perhaps be seen as an extension of Marx s work as he did not cover this area in detail  Das Kapital  his mainly economic work  was meant to be one of a series of books which would have included one on society and one on the state  but his death prevented fulfilment of this   Many of the radicals felt that Germany s lawmakers were continuing authoritarian policies and the public s apparent acquiescence was seen as a continuation of the indoctrination the Nazis had pioneered in society  Volksgemeinschaft   The Federal Republic was exporting arms to African dictatorships  which was seen as supporting the war in Southeast Asia and engineering the remilitarization of Germany with the U S  led entrenchment against the Warsaw Pact nations   Ongoing events further catalyzed the situation  Protests turned into riots on 2 June 1967  when Mohammad Reza Pahlavi  the Shah of Iran  visited West Berlin  There were protesters but also hundreds of supporters of the Shah  as well as a group of fake supporters armed with wooden staves  there to disturb the normal course of the visit  These extremists beat the protesters  After a day of angry protests by exiled Iranian radical Marxists  a group widely supported by German students  the Shah visited the Berlin Opera  where a crowd of German student protesters gathered  During the opera house demonstrations  German student Benno Ohnesorg was shot in the head by a police officer while attending his first protest rally  The officer  Karl Heinz Kurras  was acquitted in a subsequent trial  It has now been discovered that this officer had been a member of the West Berlin communist party SEW and had also worked for the Stasi  though there is no indication that Kurras  killing of Ohnesorg was under anyone s  including the Stasi s  orders   Along with perceptions of state and police brutality  and widespread opposition to the Vietnam War  Ohnesorg s death galvanised many young Germans  and became a rallying point for the West German New Left  The Berlin Movement 2 June  a militant Anarchist group  later took its name to honour the date of Ohnesorg s death   On 2 April 1968 Gudrun Ensslin and Andreas Baader  joined by Thorwald Proll and Horst Söhnlein  set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt as a protest against the Vietnam war  They were arrested two days later   On 11 April 1968 Rudi Dutschke  a leading spokesman for protesting students  was shot in the head in an assassination attempt by the right wing extremist Josef Bachmann  Although badly injured  Dutschke returned to political activism with the German Green Party before his death in a bathtub in 1979  as a consequence of his injuries   Axel Springer s populist newspaper Bild Zeitung  which had run headlines such as  Stop Dutschke now    was accused of being the chief culprit for inciting the shooting  Meinhof commented   If one sets a car on fire  that is a criminal offence  If one sets hundreds of cars on fire  that is political action    2  Formation of the RAF  All four of the defendants charged with arson and endangering human life were convicted  for which they were sentenced to three years in prison  In June 1969  however  they were temporarily paroled under an amnesty for political prisoners  but in November of that year  the Federal Constitutional Court  Bundesverfassungsgericht  demanded that they return to custody  Only Horst Söhnlein complied with the order  the rest went underground and made their way to France  where they stayed for a time in a house owned by prominent French journalist and revolutionary  Régis Debray  famous for his friendship with Che Guevara and the focus theory of guerrilla warfare  Eventually they made their way to Italy  where the lawyer Mahler visited them and encouraged them to return to Germany with him to form an underground guerrilla group   The Red Army Faction was formed with the intention of complementing the plethora of revolutionary and radical groups across West Germany and Europe  as a more class conscious and determined force compared with some of its contemporaries  The members and supporters were already associated with the  Revolutionary Cells  and Movement 2 June as well as radical currents and phenomena such as the Socialist Patients  Collective  Kommune 1 and the Situationists   Baader was arrested again in April 1970  but on 14 May 1970 he was freed by Meinhof and others  Baader  Ensslin  Mahler  and Meinhof then went to Jordan  where they trained in the West Bank and Gaza with Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  PFLP  and Palestine Liberation Organization  PLO  guerrillas and looked to the Palestinian cause for inspiration and guidance  But RAF organisation and outlook were also partly modeled on the Uruguayan Tupamaros movement  which had developed as an urban resistance movement  effectively inverting Che Guevara s Mao like concept of a peasant or rural based guerrilla war and instead situating the struggle in the metropole or cities   Many members of the RAF operated through a single contact or only knew others by their codenames  Actions were carried out by active units called  commandos   with trained members being supplied by a quartermaster in order to carry out their mission  For more long term or core cadre members  isolated cell like organisation was absent or took on a more flexible form   In 1969 the Brazilian revolutionary Carlos Marighella published his Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla  He described the urban guerrilla as   The importance of small arms training  sabotage  expropriation  and a substantial safehouse support base among the urban population was stressed in Marighella s guide  This publication was an antecedent to Meinhof s  The Urban Guerrilla Concept  and has subsequently influenced many guerrilla and insurgent groups around the globe  Although some of the Red Army Faction s supporters and operatives could be described as having an anarchist or libertarian communist slant  the group s leading members professed a largely Marxist Leninist ideology  That said  they shied away from overt collaboration with communist states  arguing along the lines of the Chinese side in the Sino Soviet split that the Soviet Union and its European satellite states had become traitors to the communist cause by  in effect if not in rhetoric  giving the United States a free pass in their exploitation of Third World populations and support of  useful  Third World dictators  Nevertheless  RAF members did receive intermittent support and sanctuary over the border in East Germany during the 1980s   2 1  Anti imperialism and public support  When they returned to West Germany  they began what they called an  anti imperialistic struggle   with bank robberies to raise money and bomb attacks against U S  military facilities  German police stations  and buildings belonging to the Axel Springer press empire  In 1970  a manifesto authored by Meinhof used the name  RAF  and the red star logo with a Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun for the first time   Despite killing 34 people  Baader Meinhof garnered a degree of support from the West German population  According to Fred Siegel  the group of militants began to be accepted  if not always admired  by  guilt ridden liberals   who saw its panache as a countercultural critique of West Germany s  boring bourgeois life  and who resented their nation s association with the American war in Vietnam  Siegel asserts that Baader Meinhof seized on this sentiment and carefully cultivated an outlaw image  wholesaling the ideal of authentically acting out one s impulses  in order to break through  the fascism of convention   just as its heroes abroad like Che Guevara supposedly  broke through the iron wall of American imperialism   Drawing on its New Left counterparts in the United States  the group even began to borrow such phrases as  burn baby burn    right on   and  off the pigs    After an intense manhunt  Baader  Ensslin  Meinhof  Holger Meins  and Jan Carl Raspe were eventually caught and arrested in June 1972   3  Custody and the Stammheim trial  After the arrest of the protagonists of the first generation of the RAF  they were held in solitary confinement in the newly constructed high security Stammheim Prison in the north of Stuttgart  When Ensslin devised an  info system  using aliases for each member  names deemed to have allegorical significance from  Moby Dick    the four prisoners were able to communicate again  circulating letters with the help of their defence counsels   To protest against their treatment by authorities  they went on several coordinated hunger strikes  eventually  they were force fed  Holger Meins died of self induced starvation on 9 November 1974  After public protests  their conditions were somewhat improved by the authorities   The so called second generation of the RAF emerged at the time  consisting of sympathizers independent of the inmates  This became clear when  on 27 February 1975  Peter Lorenz  the CDU candidate for mayor of Berlin  was kidnapped by the Movement 2 June  allied to the RAF  as part of pressure to secure the release of several other detainees  Since none of these were on trial for murder  the state agreed  and those inmates  and later Lorenz himself  were released   On 24 April 1975  the West German embassy in Stockholm was seized by members of the RAF  two of the hostages were murdered as the German government under Chancellor Helmut Schmidt refused to give in to their demands  Two of the hostage takers died from injuries they suffered when the explosives they planted detonated later that night   On 21 May 1975  the Stammheim trial of Baader  Ensslin  Meinhof  and Raspe began  named after the district in Stuttgart where it took place  The Bundestag had earlier changed the Code of Criminal Procedure so that several of the attorneys who were accused of serving as links between the inmates and the RAF s second generation could be excluded   On 9 May 1976  Ulrike Meinhof was found dead in her prison cell  hanging from a rope made from jail towels  An investigation concluded that she had hanged herself  a result hotly contested at the time  triggering a plethora of conspiracy theories  Other theories suggest that she took her life because she was being ostracized by the rest of the group   During the trial  more attacks took place  One of these was on 7 April 1977  when Federal Prosecutor Siegfried Buback  his driver  and his bodyguard were shot and killed by two RAF members while waiting at a red traffic light  Buback  who had been a Nazi member during WWII  was considered by RAF as one of the key persons for their trial  Among other things  two years earlier  while being interviewed by Stern magazine  he stated that  Persons like Baader don t deserve a fair trial   In February 1976  when interviewed by Spiegel he stated that  We do not need regulation of our jurisdiction  national security survives thanks to people like me and Herold  chief of BKA   who always find the right way      Eventually  on 28 April 1977  the trial s 192nd day  the three remaining defendants were convicted of several murders  more attempted murders  and of forming a terrorist organization  they were sentenced to life imprisonment   3 1  Security measures  Stammheim Prison was built especially for the RAF and was considered one of the most secure prison blocks around the world at the time  The prisoners were transferred there in 1975  three years after their arrest   The roof and the courtyard was covered with steel mesh  During the night the precinct was illuminated by fifty four spotlights and twenty three neon bulbs  Special military forces were guarding the roof  including snipers  Four hundred police officers along with the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution patrolled the building  The mounted police officers oscillated on a double shift  One hundred more GSG 9 units reinforced the police during the trial  BKA agents guarded the front of the court area  Finally there were helicopters flying around the area   The accredited correspondents of the media had to pass the first police road block 400 meters away from the court  The police noted their data and the number plate  and photographed their cars  After that they had to pass three verification audits  and finally they were undressed and two judicial officials thoroughly searched their bodies  They were allowed to keep only a pencil and a notepad inside the court  Their personal items including their identities were held by the authorities during the trial  Every journalist could attend the trial only twice  2 days   The Times questioned the possibility whether a fair trial could be conducted under these circumstances which involved siege like conditions  Der Spiegel was wondering whether that atmosphere anticipated  the condemnation of the defendants who were allegedly responsible for the emergency measures    During the visits from lawyers and  more rarely  relatives  friends were not allowed   three jailers were observing the conversations the prisoners had with their visitors  The prisoners were not allowed to meet each other inside the prison  until late 1975 when it was established a meeting time  30 minutes  twice per day   during which they were obviously guarded   3 2  Trial manipulation and false witnesses  The judges and their pasts are considered important by supporters of the accused  Judge Weiss  Mahler s trial  had judged Joachim Raese  president of the Third Reich’s court  as innocent seven times  When he threatened Meinhof that she would be put into a glass cage she answered caustically   So you are threatening me with Eichmann s cage  fascist    Adolf Eichmann who was an SS colonel  was held inside a glass cage during his trial in Israel   Siegfried Buback  the RAF s main trial judge in Stammheim  had been a Nazi Party member  Along with Federal Prosecutor Heinrich Wunder  who served as senior government official in Ministry of Defense   Buback had ordered the arrest of Rudolf Augstein and other journalists regarding the Spiegel scandal in 1962  Theodor Prinzing was accused by defense attorney Otto Schily that he had been appointed arbitrarily displacing other judges   During several points in the Stammheim trial  the microphones were turned off while defendants were speaking  they were often expelled from the hall  and other actions were taken  It was later revealed that the conversation they had between them as well with their attorneys were recorded  Finally it was reported by both the defendants  attorneys and some of the prison s doctors  that the physical and psychological state of the prisoners held in solitary confinement and white cells was such that they couldn t attend the long trial days and defend themselves appropriately  By the time the Stammheim trial began in early 1975  some of the prisoners had already been in solitary confinement for three years   Two former members of RAF  Karl Heinz Ruhland  and Gerhard Müller  testified under BKA s orders  as revealed later  Their statements were often contradictory  something that was also commented on in the newspapers  Ruhland himself later reported to Stern that his deposition was prepared in cooperation with police  Müller was reported to  break  during the third hunger strike in the winter 1974 75 which lasted 145 days  Prosecution offered him immunity for the murder of officer Norbert Schmidt in Hamburg 1971   and blamed Baader  Meinhof  Ensslin and Raspe instead  He was eventually freed and relocated to USA after getting a new identity and 500 000 DM   3 2 1  Lawyers  arrests  The government hastily approved several special laws for use during the Stammheim trial  Lawyers were excluded from trial for the first time since 1945  after being accused of various inappropriate actions  such as helping with to form criminal organisations  Section 129   Criminal Law   The authorities invaded and checked the lawyers  offices for possible incriminating material  Minister of Justice Hans Jochen Vogel stated proudly that no other Western state had such an extensive regulation to exclude defense attorneys from the trial  Klaus Croissant  Hans Christian Ströbele  Kurt Groenewold  who had been working preparing for the trial for three years were expelled the second day of the trial  On 23 June  1975   Croissant  Ströbele  who had already been expelled  and Mary Becker were arrested  and in the meantime police invaded several defense attorneys  offices and homes  seizing several documents and files  Ströbele and Croissant were remanded and held for 4 weeks and 8 weeks accordingly  Croissant had to pay 80 000 DM  to report weekly to police station as well as having his transport and identity papers seized   The defense lawyers and prisoners were not alone to be affected by measures adopted for the RAF trial  On 26 November 1974 an unprecedented mobilization by police and GSG 9 units  to arrest 23 suspected RAF members  included invasion to dozens of homes  left wing bookstores  and meeting places  and arrests were made  However none of the guerillas were found  BKA s chief  Horst Herold stated that despite the fact that  large scale operations usually don t bring practical results  the impression of the crowd is always a considerable advantage    On 16 February 1979 Croissant was arrested  on the accusation of supporting criminal organisation   section 129   after France denied his request for political asylum  and was sentenced to a prison term of two and half years to be served in Stammheim prison   3 3  Defence strategy on trial  The general approach by defendants and their attorneys was to highlight the political purpose and characteristics of RAF   On 13 and 14 January 1976 the defendants readied their testimony  about 200 pages  where they were analyzing the role of imperialism and its furious struggle against the revolutionary movements in the countries of the  third world   They also expounded the fascistization of West Germany and its role as an imperialistic state  alliance with USA over Vietnam   Finally they talked about the task of urban guerillas and they undertook the political responsibility for the bombing attacks  Finally their lawyers  following Ulrike Meinhof s proposal  requested that the accused be officially regarded as prisoners of war   On 4 May  5 days before Meinhof s death  the four defendants requested to provide data about the Vietnam War  They claimed that since the military intervention in Vietnam by U S  and indirectly FRG   had violated international law  the U S  military bases in FRG were justifiably targets of international retaliation  They requested several politicians  like R  Nixon and H  Schmidt  as well as some former US agents  who were willing to testify  to be called as witnesses   Later when their requests were totally rejected  US agents Barton Osbourne  ex CIA  ex member of the Phoenix Program   G  Peck NSA   and Gary Thomas gave an extensive interview  organized by defense lawyers  on 23 June 1976 where they explained by which ways FRG support was crucial for US operations in Vietnam  Peck concluded that RAF  was the response to criminal aggression of the U S  government in Indochina and the assistance of the German government  The real terrorist was my government    Thomas presented data about the joint operations of FRG and US secret services in Eastern Europe  He was also observing Stammheim trial and referred to a CIA instructor teaching them how to make a murder look like a suicide   The above statements were confirmed by the well known CIA case officer Philip Agee  4  German Autumn  On 30 July 1977  Jürgen Ponto  the head of Dresdner Bank  was shot and killed in front of his house in Oberursel in a botched kidnapping  Those involved were Brigitte Mohnhaupt  Christian Klar  and Susanne Albrecht  the last being the sister of Ponto s goddaughter   Following the convictions  Hanns Martin Schleyer  a former officer of the SS and NSDAP member who was then President of the German Employers  Association  and thus one of the most powerful industrialists in West Germany  was abducted in a violent kidnapping  On 5 September 1977  Schleyer s convoy was stopped by the kidnappers reversing a car into the path of Schleyer s vehicle  causing the Mercedes he was being driven in to crash  Once the convoy was stopped  five masked assailants immediately shot and killed the three policemen and the driver and took Schleyer hostage  One of the group  Sieglinde Hofmann  produced her weapon from a pram she was pushing down the road   A letter then arrived with the Federal Government  demanding the release of eleven detainees  including those from Stammheim  A crisis committee was formed in Bonn  headed by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt  which  instead of acceding  resolved to employ delaying tactics to give the police time to discover Schleyer s location  At the same time  a total communication ban was imposed on the prison inmates  who were now allowed visits only from government officials and the prison chaplain   The crisis dragged on for more than a month  while the Bundeskriminalamt carried out its biggest investigation to date  Matters escalated when  on 13 October 1977  Lufthansa Flight 181 from Palma de Mallorca to Frankfurt was hijacked  A group of four PLO members took control of the plane  named Landshut   The leader introduced himself to the passengers as  Captain Mahmud  who would be later identified as Zohair Youssef Akache  When the plane landed in Rome for refueling  he issued the same demands as the Schleyer kidnappers  plus the release of two Palestinians held in Turkey and payment of US$15 million   The Bonn crisis team again decided not to give in  The plane flew on via Larnaca to Dubai  and then to Aden  where flight captain Jürgen Schumann  whom the hijackers deemed not cooperative enough  was brought before an improvised  revolutionary tribunal  and executed on 16 October  His body was dumped on the runway  The aircraft again took off  flown by the co pilot Jürgen Vietor  this time headed for Mogadishu  Somalia   A high risk rescue operation was led by Hans Jürgen Wischnewski  then undersecretary in the chancellor s office  who had secretly been flown in from Bonn  At five past midnight  CET  on 18 October  the plane was stormed in a seven minute assault by the GSG 9  an elite unit of the German federal police  All four hijackers were shot  three of them died on the spot  None of the passengers were seriously hurt and Wischnewski was able to phone Schmidt and tell the Bonn crisis team that the operation had been a success   Half an hour later  German radio broadcast the news of the rescue  to which the Stammheim inmates could be listening on their radios  In the course of the night  Baader was found dead with a gunshot wound in the back of his head and Ensslin was found hanged in her cell  Raspe died in the hospital the next day from a gunshot wound to the head  Irmgard Möller  who had several stab wounds in the chest  survived and was released from prison in 1994   On 18 October 1977  Hanns Martin Schleyer was shot to death by his captors en route to Mulhouse  France  The next day  on 19 October  Schleyer s kidnappers announced that he had been  executed  and pinpointed his location  His body was recovered later that day in the trunk of a green Audi 100 on the rue Charles Péguy  The French newspaper Libération received a letter declaring   The events in the autumn of 1977 are frequently referred to as Der Deutsche Herbst   German Autumn     4 1  The  Death Night   The official inquiry concluded that the group made a collective decision to commit suicide on a predetermined night  However  the autopsy and police reports contained several contradictory statements   It has been questioned how Baader and Raspe managed to obtain a gun in the high security prison wing specially constructed for the first generation RAF members  Independent investigations showed that the inmates  lawyers were able to smuggle in weapons and equipment despite the high security  something that the lawyers themselves denied  arguing that every meeting with their clients was observed by jailers  The claims were based primarily on the testimonies of Hans Joachim Dellwo  brother of RAF prisoner Karl Heinz Dellwo  and Volker Speitel  the husband of RAF member Angelika Speitel  who were arrested on 2 October 1977 and charged of belonging to a criminal organisation  The fact that they both received lighter sentences and after their release they were given new identities raises the inquiry if they were acting under police pressure and immunity proposal as it was the case with the ex RAF members and perjurers Karl Heinz Ruhland  and Gerhard Müller  However based on these testimonies  the defense attorneys Armin Newerla and Arndt Muller were tried in 1979 and one year later they were convicted of weapon smuggling receiving three and a half years and four years and eight months sentences respectively   As regards Möller  only a total commitment to her cause could have allowed Möller to have herself inflicted the four stab wounds found near her heart  She claims that it was actually an extrajudicial killing  orchestrated by the German government  in response to Red Army Faction demands that the prisoners be released   A few more questions that were raised regarding the death night were   The autopsy concluded that Baader shot himself to the neck  3 cm above the hairline in a direction that made the bullet come out through the forehead from a straight trajectory  with a 7 65 calibre pistol which is considered implausible  Moreover the investigation carried out by the ballistic expert Dr Roland Hoffman using Baader s gun  showed that the bullet must have been fired from a distance of between 30 and 40 centimetres  which is considered likely impossible  The only case according to Hoffman that such small amount of gunpowder that was found  would fit the shoot by contact scenario would be if a silencer was used  however apparently the gun had no silencer when the body was found  The fact that three bullets were found inside Baader s cell is considered suspicious  The first explanation given was that Baader signaled the other prisoners  However the cells were soundproof and the jailors who were posted a few meters from the cells didn t hear any suspicious sound  so it remains in question how the other prisoners could have communicated   There was no gunpowder traces on Raspe s hands  even though it is considered impossible to fire a gun without leaving gunpowder on ones hands  something that it is always mentioned in autopsy reports  Baader had gunpowder on his right hand  despite the fact that he was left handed   There were no fingerprints found on either Raspe s or Baader s gun or the kitchen knife Moller used to stab herself four times  according to official statements  The public prosecutor s office argued that due to the large amount of blood that covered the weapons  the traces couldn t be determined  However later Mr  Testor who was the head of the investigation team for the events in Stammheim  argued that there was no blood on Raspe s pistol  and stated   If the weapons had been polished with a cloth before the act  then no usable traces could have remained after only being used once   Finally Raspe was still holding the gun inside his hand when he was found  something considered at least unusual   As regards Ensslin  there were similar questions to Meinhof s case  There are arguments that the chair she allegedly used to hang herself was too far away from her body to have been used  and that the cable used to hang herself was such that it would most likely not tolerate the weight of a fallen body  Finally Ensslin had written to their lawyers   I am afraid of being suicided in the same way as Ulrike  If there is no letter from me and I’m found dead  in this case it is an assassination   Finally the international commission that had been formed to investigate Ulrike Meinhof s death  and hadn t been dissolved at the time  noticed that on both nights  8–9 May 1976  the night Meinhof had supposedly committed suicide   and 17–18 October 1977  an auxiliary was in charge of surveillance rather than the usual guard  They also discovered an uncontrolled entrance to the seventh floor which led to the roof  The authorities claimed they were unaware of this until 4 November 1977   5  The RAF since the 1980s  The dissolution of the Soviet Union was a serious blow to Leninist groups  but well into the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name  RAF   Among these were the killing of Ernst Zimmermann  CEO of MTU Aero Engines  a German engineering company  another bombing at the US Air Force s Rhein Main Air Base  near Frankfurt   which targeted the base commander and killed two bystanders  the car bomb attack that killed Siemens executive Karl Heinz Beckurts and his driver  and the shooting of Gerold von Braunmühl  a leading official at Germany s foreign ministry  On 30 November 1989  Deutsche Bank chairman Alfred Herrhausen was killed with a highly complex bomb when his car triggered a photo sensor  in Bad Homburg  On 1 April 1991  Detlev Karsten Rohwedder  leader of the government Treuhand organization responsible for the privatization of the East German state economy  was shot dead  The assassins of Zimmermann  von Braunmühl  Herrhausen and Rohwedder were never reliably identified   After German reunification in 1990  it was confirmed that the RAF had received financial and logistic support from the Stasi  the security and intelligence organization of East Germany  which had given several members shelter and new identities  This was already generally suspected at the time   In 1992  the German government assessed that the RAF s main field of engagement now was missions to release former RAF members  To weaken the organization further the government declared that some RAF inmates would be released if the RAF refrained from violent attacks in the future  Subsequently the RAF announced their intention to  de escalate  and refrain from significant activity   The last action taken by the RAF took place in 1993 with a bombing of a newly built prison in Weiterstadt by overcoming the officers on duty and planting explosives  Although no one was seriously injured this operation caused property damage amounting to 123 million German Marks  over 50 million euros    The last big action against the RAF took place on 27 June 1993  A Verfassungsschutz  internal secret service  agent named Klaus Steinmetz had infiltrated the RAF  As a result Birgit Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams were to be arrested in Bad Kleinen  Grams and GSG 9 officer Michael Newrzella died during the mission  While it was initially concluded that Grams committed suicide  others claimed his death was in revenge for Newrzella s  Two eyewitness accounts supported the claims of an execution style murder  However  an investigation headed by the Attorney General failed to substantiate such claims  Due to a number of operational mistakes involving the various police services  German Minister of the Interior Rudolf Seiters took responsibility and resigned from his post   5 1  Dissolution  On 20 April 1998  an eight page typewritten letter in German was faxed to the Reuters news agency  signed  RAF  with the machine gun red star  declaring the group dissolved    Almost 28 years ago  on 14 May 1970  the RAF arose in a campaign of liberation  Today we end this project  The urban guerrilla in the shape of the RAF is now history       In response to this statement  former BKA President Horst Herold said   With this statement the Red Army Faction has erected its own tombstone    5 2  Legacy  Horst Mahler  a founding RAF member  is now a vocal Neo Nazi and Holocaust denier  In 2005  Mahler was sentenced to 6 years in prison for incitement to racial hatred against Jews  He is on record as saying that his beliefs have not changed  Der Feind ist der Gleiche  The enemy is the same    In 2007  amidst widespread media controversy  the German president Horst Köhler considered pardoning RAF member Christian Klar  who had filed a pardon application several years before  On 7 May 2007  pardon was denied  regular parole was later granted on 24 November 2008  RAF member Brigitte Mohnhaupt was granted release on five year parole by a German court on 12 February 2007 and Eva Haule was released 17 August 2007   6  Name  6 1  Faction versus Fraktion  The usual translation into English is the Red Army Faction  however  the founders wanted it not to reflect a splinter group but rather an embryonic militant unit that was embedded in or part of a wider communist workers  movement  i e  a  fraction  of a whole   6 2  RAF versus Baader Meinhof  The group always called itself the Rote Armee Fraktion  never the Baader Meinhof Group or Gang  The name correctly refers to all incarnations of the organization  the  first generation  RAF  which consisted of Baader and his associates  the  second generation  RAF  and the  third generation  RAF  which existed in the 1980s and 90s   The terms  Baader Meinhof Gang  and  Baader Meinhof Group  were first used by the media and the organization was generally known by these during its first generation  and applies only until Baader s death in 1977  The organization never used these terms for themselves  but the German media used them to avoid legitimizing the movement  Although Meinhof was not considered to be a leader of the gang at any time  her involvement in Baader s escape from jail in 1970 led to her name becoming attached to it   7  List of assaults attributed to the RAF  8  RAF Commandos  The following is a list of all known
