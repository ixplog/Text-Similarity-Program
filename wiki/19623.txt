The Mitsubishi A6M Zero was a long range fighter aircraft  manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  and operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1940 to 1945  The A6M was designated as the   or the Mitsubishi A6M Rei sen  The A6M was usually referred to by its pilots as the  Reisen   zero fighter    0  being the last digit of the Imperial year 2600  1940  when it entered service with the Imperial Navy  The official Allied reporting name was  Zeke   although the use of the name  Zero  was later commonly adopted by the Allies as well   When it was introduced early in World War II  the Zero was considered the most capable carrier based fighter in the world  combining excellent maneuverability and very long range  In early combat operations  the Zero gained a legendary reputation as a dogfighter  achieving the outstanding kill ratio of 12 to 1  but by mid 1942 a combination of new tactics and the introduction of better equipment enabled the Allied pilots to engage the Zero on generally equal terms   The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service   IJNAS   also frequently used the type as a land based fighter  By 1943  inherent design weaknesses and the failure to develop more powerful aircraft engines meant that the Zero became less effective against newer enemy fighters  which possessed greater firepower  armor  and speed  and approached the Zero s maneuverability  Although the Mitsubishi A6M was outdated by 1944  design delays and production difficulties of newer Japanese aircraft types meant that it continued to serve in a front line role until the end of the war  During the final years of the War in the Pacific  the Zero was also adapted for use in kamikaze operations  During the course of the war  Japan produced more Zeros than any other model of combat aircraft   1  Design and development  The Mitsubishi A5M fighter was just entering service in early 1937  when the Imperial Japanese Navy started looking for its eventual replacement  In May  they issued specification 12 Shi for a new carrier based fighter  sending it to Nakajima and Mitsubishi  Both firms started preliminary design work while they awaited more definitive requirements to be handed over in a few months   Based on the experiences of the A5M in China  the Imperial Japanese Navy sent out updated requirements in October calling for a speed of and a climb to in 3 5 min  With drop tanks  they wanted an endurance of two hours at normal power  or six to eight hours at economical cruising speed  Armament was to consist of two 20 mm cannons  two 7 7 mm   303 in  machine guns and two 30 kg  66 lb  or 60 kg  132 lb  bombs  A complete radio set was to be mounted in all aircraft  along with a radio direction finder for long range navigation  The maneuverability was to be at least equal to that of the A5M  while the wingspan had to be less than 12 m  39 ft  to allow for use on an aircraft carrier  All this was to be achieved with available engines  a significant design limitation  The Zero s powerplant seldom reached 750 kilowatts  about 1 000 hp  in any of its variants   Nakajima s team considered the new requirements unachievable and pulled out of the competition in January  Mitsubishi s chief designer  Jiro Horikoshi  felt that the requirements could be met  but only if the aircraft could be made as light as possible  Every possible weight saving measure was incorporated into the design  Most of the aircraft was built of a new top secret 7075 aluminium alloy developed by Sumitomo Metal Industries in 1936  Called Extra Super Duralumin  ESD   it was lighter and stronger than other alloys  e g  24S alloy  used at the time  but was more brittle and prone to corrosion which was countered with an anti corrosion coating applied after fabrication  No armor was provided for the pilot  engine or other critical points of the aircraft  and self sealing fuel tanks  which were becoming common at the time  were not used  This made the Zero lighter  more maneuverable  and the longest range single engine fighter of WWII  which made it capable of searching out an enemy hundreds of miles away  bringing them to battle  then returning hundreds of miles back to its base or aircraft carrier  However  that trade in weight and construction also made it prone to catching fire and exploding when struck by enemy rounds   With its low wing cantilever monoplane layout  retractable  wide set landing gear and enclosed cockpit  the Zero was one of the most modern aircraft in the world at the time of its introduction  It had a fairly high lift  low speed wing with a very low wing loading  This  combined with its light weight  resulted in a very low stalling speed of well below   This was the main reason for its phenomenal maneuverability  allowing it to out turn any Allied fighter of the time  Early models were fitted with servo tabs on the ailerons after pilots complained control forces became too heavy at speeds above   They were discontinued on later models after it was found that the lightened control forces were causing pilots to overstress the wings during vigorous maneuvers   It has been claimed that the Zero s design showed clear influence from American fighter planes and components exported to Japan in the 1930s  and in particular the Vought V 143 fighter  Chance Vought had sold the prototype for this aircraft and its plans to Japan in 1937  Eugene Wilson  President of Vought  claimed that when shown a captured Zero in 1943  he found that  There on the floor was the Vought V 142 or just the spitting image of it  Japanese made   while the  power plant installation was distinctly Chance Vought  the wheel stowage into the wing roots came from Northrop  and the Japanese designers had even copied the Navy inspection stamp from Pratt & Whitney type parts   While the sale of the V 143 was fully legal  Wilson later acknowledged the conflicts of interest that can arise whenever military technology is exported  In fact  there was no significant relationship between the V 143  which was an unsuccessful design that had been rejected by the U S  Army Air Corps and several export customers  and the Zero  with only a superficial similarity in layout  Allegations about the Zero being a copy have been mostly discredited   1 1  Name  The A6M is universally known as the  Zero  from its Japanese Navy type designation  Type 0 Carrier Fighter  Rei shiki Kanjō sentōki  零式艦上戦闘機   taken from the last digit of the Imperial year 2600  1940   when it entered service  In Japan  it was unofficially referred to as both Rei sen and Zero sen  Japanese pilots most commonly called it Zero sen  where sen is the first syllable of sentoki  Japanese for  fighter    In the official designation  A6M  the  A  signified a carrier based fighter   6  meant it was the sixth such model built for the Imperial Navy  and  M  indicated the manufacturer  Mitsubishi   The official Allied code name was  Zeke   in keeping with the practice of giving male names to Japanese fighters  female names to bombers  bird names to gliders  and tree names to trainers   Zeke  was part of the first batch of  hillbilly  code names assigned by Captain Frank T  McCoy of Nashville  Tennessee  assigned to the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit  ATAIU  at Eagle Farm Airport in Australia   who wanted quick  distinctive  easy to remember names  When  in 1942  the Allied code for Japanese aircraft was introduced  he logically chose  Zeke  for the  Zero   Later  two variants of the fighter received their own code names  the Nakajima A6M2 N  floatplane version of the Zero  was called  Rufe  and the A6M3 32 variant was initially called  Hap   After objections from General  Hap  Arnold  commander of the USAAF  the name was changed to  Hamp   When captured examples were examined in New Guinea  it was realized it was a variant of the Zero and finally renamed  Zeke 32    2  Operational history  The first Zeros  pre series A6M2  went into operation in July 1940  On 13 September 1940  the Zeros scored their first air to air victories when 13 A6M2s led by Lieutenant Saburo Shindo attacked 27 Soviet built Polikarpov I 15s and I 16s of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force  shooting down all the fighters without loss to themselves  By the time they were redeployed a year later  the Zeros had shot down 99 Chinese aircraft  266 according to other sources    At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor 420 Zeros were active in the Pacific  The carrier borne Model 21 was the type encountered by the Americans  Its tremendous range of over 2 600 km  1 600 mi  allowed it to range farther from its carrier than expected  appearing over distant battlefronts and giving Allied commanders the impression that there were several times as many Zeros as actually existed   The Zero quickly gained a fearsome reputation  Thanks to a combination of excellent maneuverability and firepower  it easily disposed of the motley collection of Allied aircraft sent against it in the Pacific in 1941  It proved a difficult opponent even for the Supermarine Spitfire  Although not as fast as the British fighter  the Mitsubishi fighter could out turn the Spitfire with ease  could sustain a climb at a very steep angle  and could stay in the air for three times as long   Soon  however  Allied pilots developed tactics to cope with the Zero  Due to its extreme agility  engaging a Zero in a traditional  turning dogfight was likely to be fatal  It was better to roar down from above in a high speed pass  fire a quick burst  then climb quickly back up to altitude   A short burst of fire from heavy machine guns or cannon was often enough to bring down the fragile Zero   Such  boom and zoom  tactics were used successfully in the China Burma India Theater  CBI  by the  Flying Tigers  of the American Volunteer Group  AVG  against similarly maneuverable Japanese Army aircraft such as the Nakajima Ki 27 Nate and Ki 43 Oscar  AVG pilots were trained to exploit the advantages of their P 40s  which were very sturdy  heavily armed  generally faster in a dive and level flight at low altitude  with a good rate of roll   Another important maneuver was Lieutenant Commander John S   Jimmy  Thach s  Thach Weave   in which two fighters would fly about 60 m  200 ft  apart  If a Zero latched onto the tail of one of the fighters  the two aircraft would turn toward each other  If the Zero followed his original target through the turn  he would come into a position to be fired on by the target s wingman  This tactic was first used to good effect during the Battle of Midway  and later over the Solomon Islands  Many highly experienced Japanese aviators were lost in combat  resulting in a progressive decline in the quality of the opponents faced by Allied pilots  which became a significant factor in Allied successes  Unexpected heavy losses of these pilots at the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway dealt the Japanese carrier air force a blow from which it never fully recovered   However  throughout the engagement at Midway  the Allied Pilots registered a high dissatisfaction with the current state of the Grumman F4F Wildcat  The Commanding Officer of the USS Yorktown noted  They were astounded by the Zero s superiority   In contrast  Allied fighters were designed with ruggedness and pilot protection in mind  The Japanese ace Saburō Sakai described how the resilience of early Grumman aircraft was a factor in preventing the Zero from attaining total domination   When the powerfully armed Lockheed P 38 Lightning — possessing four  light barrel  AN M2  50 cal  Browning machine guns and one 20 mm autocannon — and the Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair  each using six of the AN M2 heavy calibre Browning guns appeared in the Pacific theater  the A6M  with its low powered engine and lighter armament  was hard pressed to remain competitive  In combat with an F6F or F4U  the only positive thing that could be said of the Zero at this stage of the war was that in the hands of a skillful pilot it could maneuver as well as most of its opponents  Nonetheless  in competent hands the Zero could still be deadly   Due to shortages of high powered aviation engines and problems with planned successor models  the Zero remained in production until 1945  with over 11 000 of all variants produced   2 1  Allied opinions  The American military discovered many of the A6M s unique attributes when they recovered a largely intact specimen  the Akutan Zero  on Akutan Island in the Aleutians  During an air raid over Dutch Harbor on 4 June 1942  one A6M fighter was hit by ground fire  Losing oil  Flight Petty Officer Tadayoshi Koga attempted an emergency landing on Akutan Island about 20 miles northeast of Dutch Harbor  but his Zero flipped over in soft ground in a sudden crash landing  Koga died instantly of head injuries  but the relatively undamaged fighter was found over a month later by an American salvage team and shipped to Naval Air Station North Island where testing flights of the repaired A6M revealed both strengths and deficiencies in design and performance   The experts who evaluated the captured Zero found that the plane weighed about 2 360 kg  5 200 pounds  fully loaded  about half the weight of the standard United States Navy fighter  It was  built like a fine watch   the Zero was constructed with flush rivets  and even the guns were flush with the wings  The instrument panel was a  marvel of simplicity     with no superfluities to distract  the pilot    What most impressed the experts was that the Zero s fuselage and wings were constructed in one piece  unlike the American method that built them separately and joined the two parts together  The Japanese method was much slower  but resulted in a very strong structure and improved close maneuverability   Captain Eric Brown  the Chief Naval Test Pilot of the Royal Navy  recalled being impressed by the Zero during tests of captured aircraft   I don’t think I have ever flown a fighter that could match the rate of turn of the Zero  The Zero had ruled the roost totally and was the finest fighter in the world until mid 1943   American test pilots found that the Zero s controls were  very light  at   but stiffened at faster speeds  above 348 km h  or 216 mph  to safeguard against wing failure  The Zero could not keep up with Allied aircraft in high speed maneuvers  and its low  never exceed speed   VNE  made it vulnerable in a dive  While stable on the ground despite its light weight  the aircraft was designed purely for the attack role  emphasizing long range  maneuverability  and firepower at the expense of protection of its pilot  Most lacked self sealing tanks and armor plating   3  Variants  3 1  A6M1  Type 0 Prototypes  The first A6M1 prototype was completed in March 1939  powered by the 580 kW  780 hp  Mitsubishi Zuisei 13 engine with a two blade propeller  It first flew on 1 April  and passed testing in a remarkably short period of time  By September  it had already been accepted for Navy testing as the A6M1 Type 0 Carrier Fighter  with the only notable change being a switch to a three bladed propeller to cure a vibration problem   3 2  A6M2 Type 0 Model 11  While the Navy was testing the first two prototypes  they suggested that the third be fitted with the 700 kW  940 hp  Nakajima Sakae 12 engine instead  Mitsubishi had its own engine of this class in the form of the Kinsei  so they were somewhat reluctant to use the Sakae  Nevertheless  when the first A6M2 was completed in January 1940  the Sakae s extra power pushed the performance of the Zero well past the original specifications   The new version was so promising that the Navy had 15 built and shipped to China before they had completed testing  They arrived in Manchuria in July 1940  and first saw combat over Chungking in August  There they proved to be completely untouchable by the Polikarpov I 16s and I 153s that had been such a problem for the A5Ms currently in service  In one encounter  13 Zeros shot down 27 I 15s and I 16s in under three minutes without loss  After hearing of these reports the Navy immediately ordered the A6M2 into production as the Type 0 Carrier Fighter  Model 11  Reports of the Zero s performance filtered back to the US slowly  There they were dismissed by most military officials  who felt it was impossible for the Japanese to build such an aircraft   3 3  A6M2 Type 0 Model 21  After the delivery of only 65 aircraft by November 1940  a further change was worked into the production lines  which introduced folding wingtips to allow them to fit on aircraft carriers  The resulting Model 21 would become one of the most produced versions early in the war  A feature was the improved range with 520lt wing tank and 320lt drop tank  When the lines switched to updated models  740 Model 21s had been completed by Mitsubishi  and another 800 by Nakajima  Two other versions of the Model 21 were built in small numbers  the Nakajima built A6M2 N  Rufe  floatplane  based on the Model 11 with a slightly modified tail   and the A6M2 K two seat trainer of which a total of 508 were built by Hitachi and the Sasebo Naval Air Arsenal   3 4  A6M3 Type 0 Model 32  In 1941  Nakajima introduced the Sakae 21 engine  which used a two speed supercharger for better altitude performance  and increased power to 840 kW  1 130 hp   A prototype Zero with the new engine was first flown on July 15  1941   The new Sakae was slightly heavier and somewhat longer due to the larger supercharger  which moved the center of gravity too far forward on the existing airframe  To correct for this  the engine mountings were cut back by 185 mm to move the engine toward the cockpit  This had the side effect of reducing the size of the main fuselage fuel tank  located between the engine and the cockpit  from 518 L  137 US gal  to 470 L  120 US gal   The cowling was redesigned to enlarge the cowl flaps  revise the oil cooler air intake  and move the carburetor air intake to the upper half of the cowling   The wings were redesigned to reduce span  eliminate the folding tips  and square off the wingtips  The inboard edge of the aileron was moved outboard by one rib  and the wing fuel tanks were enlarged accordingly to 420 L  The two 20 mm wing cannon were upgraded from the 99 Shiki 1 Gou Koteijū 1 Kata Kai 1 to the 99 Shiki 1 Gou Koteijū 3 Gata  which required a bulge in the sheet metal of the wing below each cannon  The wings also included larger ammunition boxes  allowing for 100 rounds for each of the 20 mm cannon   The Sakae 21 engine and other changes increased maximum speed by only 11 kph compared to the Model 21  but sacrifed nearly 1 000 km of range  Nevertheless  the navy accepted the type and it entered production in April 1942   The shorter wing span led to better roll  and the reduced drag allowed the diving speed to be increased to 670 km h  420 mph   On the downside  turning and range  which were the strengths of the Model 21  suffered due to smaller ailerons  decreased lift and greater fuel consumption  The shorter range proved a significant limitation during the Solomons Campaign  during which Zeros based at Rabaul had to travel nearly to their maximum range to reach Guadalcanal and return  Consequently  the Model 32 was unsuited to that campaign and was used mainly for shorter range offensive missions and interception   The redesign was enough to prompt the US to assign the Model 32 a new code name   Hap   This name was short lived  as a protest from USAAF Commanding General Henry  Hap  Arnold forced a change to  Hamp   Soon after  it was realized that it was simply a new model of the  Zeke    This variant was flown by only a small number of units  and only 343 were built   3 5  A6M3 Type 0 Model 22  In order to correct the deficiencies of the Model 32  a new version with the folding wingtips of the Model 21  new fuel tanks in the outer wings  and attachments and fuel lines for a 330 L  90 US gal  drop tank under each wing were introduced  The internal fuel was increased to 570 L  137 US gal  in this model  regaining all of the range lost in the Model 32 variant   As the wing had significant redesign  this version received a new navy designation  22 型  2 2 kata  known in the West as a Model 22   The new model entered service circa December 1942  before the navy formally accepted the new design  and 560 were eventually produced  all by Mitsubishi  This wing is seen with two armament configurations  The Model 22 has the same wing armament as in the Model 32  The 22型甲  2 2 kata kou  aka Model 22a  has one 99式2号固定銃3型  9 9 shiki 2 gou koteijū 3 gata  cannon in each wing  The barrel protrudes   According to one theory  very late production Model 22s may have had a wing similar to the shortened  rounded tip wing of the Model 52  One such plane was photographed at Lakunai Airfield   Rabaul East   in the second half of 1943  and the photo has been published in a number of Japanese books  e g   Aero Detail 7 and 世界の傑作機 9 at page 33  Sekai no Kessaku Ki  aka Famous Airplanes of the World 9  1993   Although jumping to the conclusion that the cowling is that of the Models 32 and 22  the latter book proposes that the plane is an early production Model 52  based upon an unspecified manual  see below   There is a growing body of evidence that this  hybrid  type is simply an early production Model 52  see below    The Model 32  22  22 kou  52  52 kou and 52 otsu were all powered by the Nakajima 栄  Sakae  21型 engine  That engine kept its designation in spite of changes in the exhaust system for the Model 52    3 6  A6M4 Type 0 Model 41 42  Mitsubishi is unable to state with certainty that it ever used the designation  A6M4  or model numbers for it  However   A6M4  does appear in a translation of a captured Japanese memo from a Naval Air Technical Arsenal  titled Quarterly Report on Research Experiments  dated 1 October 1942  It mentions a  cross section of the A6M4 intercooler  then being designed  Some researchers believe  A6M4  was applied to one or two prototype planes fitted with an experimental turbo supercharged Sakae engine designed for high altitude  Mitsubishi s involvement in the project was probably quite limited or nil  the unmodified Sakae engine was made by Nakajima  The design and testing of the turbo supercharger was the responsibility of the 第一海軍航空廠  Dai Ichi Kaigun Kōkūshō  First Naval Air  Technical  Arsenal  at Yokosuka  At least one photo of a prototype plane exists  It shows a turbo unit mounted in the forward left fuselage   Lack of suitable alloys for use in the manufacture of a turbo supercharger and its related ducting caused numerous ruptures  resulting in fires and poor performance  Consequently  further development of a turbo supercharged A6M was cancelled  The lack of acceptance by the navy suggests that the navy did not bestow model number 41 or 42 formally  although it appears that the arsenal did use the designation  A6M4   The prototype engines nevertheless provided useful experience for future engine designs   3 7  A6M5 Type 0 Model 52  Sometimes considered the most effective variant  the Model 52 was developed to again shorten the wings to increase speed and dispense with the folding wing mechanism  In addition  ailerons  aileron trim tab and flaps were revised  Produced first by Mitsubishi  most Model 52s were made by Nakajima  The prototype was made in June 1943 by modifying an A6M3 and was first flown in August 1943  The first Model 52 is said in the handling manual to have 製造番号  seizō bangō  manufacture number  3904  which apparently refers to the prototype   Research by Mr  Bunzo Komine published by Mr  Kenji Miyazaki states that aircraft 3904 through 4103 had the same exhaust system and cowl flaps as on the Model 22  This is partially corroborated by two wrecks researched by Mr  Stan Gajda and Mr  L  G  Halls  seizō bangō 4007 and 4043  respectively   The upper cowling was slightly redesigned from that of the Model 22    A new exhaust system provided an increment of thrust by aiming the stacks aft and distributing them around the forward fuselage  The new exhaust system required  notched  cowl flaps and heat shields just aft of the stacks   Note  however  that the handling manual translation states that the new style of exhaust commenced with number 3904  Whether this is correct  indicates retrofitting intentions  refers to the prototype but not to all subsequent planes  or is in error is not clear   From seizō bangō 4274  the wing fuel tanks received carbon dioxide fire extinguishers  From number 4354  the radio became the Model 3  aerial Mark 1  and at that point it is said the antenna mast was shortened slightly  Through seizō bangō 4550  the lowest exhaust stacks were approximately the same length as those immediately above them  This caused hot exhaust to burn the forward edge of the landing gear doors and heat the tires  Therefore  from number 4551 Mitsubishi began to install shorter bottom stacks  Nakajima manufactured the Model 52 at its Koizumi plant in Gunma Prefecture  The A6M5 had a maximum speed of 565 km h  351 mph  at 6 000 meters and reached that altitude in 7 01 minutes   Subsequent variants included   A6M5a  Model 52甲  Kō  a    Starting at Mitsubishi number 4651  an armament change substituted the Type 99 2 Mark 4 cannon  a belt fed gun of 125 rounds per gun  in place of the drum fed Type 99 2 Mark 3 of 100 rpg  The larger bulge in the underside of the wing for each cannon was deleted and the ejection port for spent cartridge cases was moved  Thicker wing skinning was installed to permit higher diving speeds   A6M5b  Model 52乙  Otsu  b    Armament change  The 7 7 mm   303 in  Type 97 gun  750 m s muzzle velocity and 600 m 1 970 ft range  in the right forward fuselage was replaced by a 13 2 mm Type 3 Browning derived gun  790 m s muzzle velocity and 900 m 2 950 ft range  with 240 rounds  The larger weapon required an enlarged opening  creating a distinctive asymmetric appearance to the top of the cowling  and a revised gas outlet near the windscreen  In addition  each wing cannon received a fairing at the wing leading edge  A plate of armored glass 45 mm thick was fitted to the windscreen  A larger propeller spinner was fitted  suggesting a change to the propeller  The central drop tank became one with fins  suspended on a slanted pipe  The first of this variant was completed in April 1944 and it was produced until October 1944   A6M5c  Model 52丙  Hei  c    Armament change  One 13 2 mm   51 in  Type 3 machine gun with a rate of fire of 800 rpm was added in each wing outboard of the cannon  but the 7 7 mm gun at the left side of the cowl was deleted  Four racks for rockets or small bombs were installed outboard of the 13 mm gun in each wing  Engine change  Some sources state that the hei had a Sakae 31 engine In addition  a 55 mm thick piece of armored glass was installed at the headrest and a plate of armor was installed behind the seat  The mounting of the central 300L drop tank changed to a four post design  Wing skin was thickened further  The first of this variant was completed in September 1944  Because of the gain in weight  this variant was used mainly for intercepting B 29s and special attack   A6M5 S  A6M5 Yakan Sentōki    Armament change  To intercept B 29s and other night flying aircraft  an air arsenal converted some Model 52s to night fighters  They were armed with one 20 mm Type 99 cannon behind the pilot  aimed upward and similar to the Luftwaffe Schräge Musik installation  However  lack of radar prevented them from being very effective  Some Model 21 and 52 aircraft were converted to  bakusen   fighter bombers  by hanging a bomb rack and 250 kg bomb in place of the centerline drop tank   Perhaps seven Model 52 planes were ostensibly converted into A6M5 K two seat trainers  mass production was contemplated by Hitachi but not undertaken   3 8  A6M6c Type 0 Model 53c  This was similar to the A6M5c  but with self sealing wing tanks and a Nakajima Sakae 31a engine featuring water methanol engine boost   3 9  A6M7 Type 0 Model 62  Similar to the A6M6 but intended for attack or Kamikaze role   3 10  A6M8 Type 0 Model 64  Similar to the A6M6 but with the Sakae  now out of production  replaced by the Mitsubishi Kinsei 62 engine with 1 560 hp  1 164 kW   60% more powerful than the engine of the A6M2  This resulted in an extensively modified cowling and nose for the aircraft  The carburetor intake was much larger  a long duct like that on the Nakajima B6N Tenzan was added  and a large spinner—like that on the Yokosuka D4Y Suisei with the Kinsei 62—was mounted  The larger cowling meant deletion of the fuselage mounted machine gun  but armament was otherwise unchanged from the Model 52 Hei  2 x 20 mm cannon  2 x 13 mm  51 in MG   In addition  the Model 64 was modified to carry two 150 L  40 US gal  drop tanks on either wing in order to permit the mounting of a 250 kg  550 lb  bomb on the underside of the fuselage  Two prototypes were completed in April 1945 but the chaotic situation of Japanese industry and the end of the war obstructed the start of the ambitious program of production for 6 300 machines  none being completed   4  Operators     Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service  Royal Thai Air Force  Royal Thai Navy  4 1  Post war     Indonesian Air Force  Republic of China Air

Fantasy of Flight in Polk City  Florida  Along with several other Zeros  it was found near Rabaul in the South Pacific  The markings suggest that it was in service after June 1943 and further investigation suggests that it has cockpit features associated with the Nakajima built Model 52b  If this is correct  it is most likely one of the 123 aircraft lost by the Japanese during the assault of Rabaul  The aircraft was shipped in pieces to the attraction and it was eventually made up for display as a crashed aircraft  Much of the aircraft is usable for patterns and some of its parts can be restored to one day make this a basis for a flyable aircraft   Four flyable Zero airframes exist  Three have had their engines replaced with similar American units  Only one  the Planes of Fame Museum s A6M5 bearing tail number  61 120   recovered from Saipan  has the original Sakae engine   Although not a survivor  the  Blayd  Zero is a reconstruction based on templating original Zero components recovered from the South Pacific  To be considered a  restoration  and not a reproduction  the builders used a small fraction of parts from the original Zero landing gear in the reconstruction  Restored as a A6M2 Model 21  it is currently owned by the Texas Flying Legends Museum   The Commemorative Air Force s A6M3 was recovered from Babo Airfield  New Guinea  in 1991  It was partially restored from several A6M3s in Russia  then brought to the United States for restoration  The aircraft was re registered in 1998 and displayed at the Museum of Flying in Santa Monica
