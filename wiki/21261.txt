the nationwide land leveling and rezoning campaign initiated by Kim Jong Il in Kangwon province in May 1998 and in North Pyongan province in January 2000 facilitated the construction of provincial and county fiber optic lines  which were laid by tens of thousands of KPA soldier builders and provincial shock brigade members mobilized for the large scale public works projects designed to rehabilitate the hundreds of thousands of hectares of arable lands devastated by the natural disasters in the late 1990s   3  Television  Broadcasting in North Korea is tightly controlled by the state and is used
