The Weather Underground Organization  WUO   commonly known as the Weather Underground  was an American radical left wing organization founded on the Ann Arbor campus of the University of Michigan  Originally called Weatherman  the group became known colloquially as the Weathermen  Weatherman organized in 1969 as a faction of Students for a Democratic Society  SDS  composed for the most part of the national office leadership of SDS and their supporters  Their goal was to create a clandestine revolutionary party for the overthrow of the U S  government   With revolutionary positions characterized by black power and opposition to the Vietnam War  the group conducted a campaign of bombings through the mid 1970s and took part in actions such as the jailbreak of Dr  Timothy Leary  The  Days of Rage   their first public demonstration on October 8  1969  was a riot in Chicago timed to coincide with the trial of the Chicago Seven  In 1970 the group issued a  Declaration of a State of War  against the United States government  under the name  Weather Underground Organization    The bombing campaign attacked mostly targeted government buildings  along with several banks  Most were preceded by evacuation warnings  along with communiqués identifying the particular matter that the attack was intended to protest  No persons were killed in any of their acts of property destruction  although three members of the group were killed in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion  Former members of the group robbed a Brink s armored car in 1981  which resulted in the deaths of three people including Waverly Brown  the first black police officer on the Nyack police force   For the bombing of the United States Capitol on March 1  1971  they issued a communiqué saying that it was  in protest of the U S  invasion of Laos   For the bombing of the Pentagon on May 19  1972  they stated that it was  in retaliation for the U S  bombing raid in Hanoi   For the January 29  1975 bombing of the United States Department of State building  they stated that it was  in response to the escalation in Vietnam    The Weathermen grew out of the Revolutionary Youth Movement  RYM  faction of SDS  It took its name from Bob Dylan s lyric   You don t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows   from the song  Subterranean Homesick Blues   1965    You don t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows   was the title of a position paper that they distributed at an SDS convention in Chicago on June 18  1969  This founding document called for a  white fighting force  to be allied with the  Black Liberation Movement  and other radical movements to achieve  the destruction of U S  imperialism and achieve a classless world  world communism    The Weathermen began to disintegrate after the United States reached a peace accord in Vietnam in 1973  after which the New Left declined in influence  By 1977  the organization was defunct   1  Background and formation  The Weathermen emerged from the campus based opposition to the Vietnam War  and from the Civil Rights Movements of the late 1960s  During this time  United States military action in Southeast Asia  especially in Vietnam  escalated  In the U S   the anti war sentiment was particularly pronounced during the 1968 U S  presidential election   The origins of the Weathermen can be traced to the collapse and fragmentation of the Students for a Democratic Society following a split between office holders of SDS  or  National Office   and their supporters and the Progressive Labor Party  PLP   During the factional struggle National Office leaders such as Bernardine Dohrn and Mike Klonsky began announcing their emerging perspectives  and Klonsky published a document titled  Toward a Revolutionary Youth Movement   RYM    RYM promoted the philosophy that young workers possessed the potential to be a revolutionary force to overthrow capitalism  if not by themselves then by transmitting radical ideas to the working class  Klonsky s document reflected the philosophy of the National Office and was eventually adopted as official SDS doctrine  During the summer of 1969  the National Office began to split  A group led by Klonsky became known as RYM II  and the other side  RYM I  was led by Dohrn and endorsed more aggressive tactics such as direct action  as some members felt that years of non violent resistance had done little or nothing to stop the Vietnam War  The Weathermen strongly sympathized with the radical Black Panthers  The police killing of Panther Fred Hampton prompted the Weatherman to issue a declaration of war upon the United States government   1 1  SDS Convention  June 1969  At an SDS convention in Chicago on June 18  1969  the National Office attempted to persuade unaffiliated delegates not to endorse a takeover of SDS by Progressive Labor who had packed the convention with their supporters  At the beginning of the convention  two position papers were passed out by the National Office leadership  one a revised statement of Klonksy s RYM manifesto  the other called  You Don t Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows   The latter document outlined the position of the group that would become the Weathermen  It had been signed by Karen Ashley  Bill Ayers  Bernardine Dohrn  John Jacobs  Jeff Jones  Gerry Long  Howie Machtinger  Jim Mellen  Terry Robbins  Mark Rudd  and Steve Tappis  The document called for creating a clandestine revolutionary party   The most important task for us toward making the revolution  and the work our collectives should engage in  is the creation of a mass revolutionary movement  without which a clandestine revolutionary party will be impossible  A revolutionary mass movement is different from the traditional revisionist mass base of  sympathizers   Rather it is akin to the Red Guard in China  based on the full participation and involvement of masses of people in the practice of making revolution  a movement with a full willingness to participate in the violent and illegal struggle  At this convention the Weatherman faction of the Students for a Democratic Society  planned for October 8–11  as a  National Action  built around John Jacobs  slogan   bring the war home   The National Action grew out of a resolution drafted by Jacobs and introduced at the October 1968 SDS National Council meeting in Boulder  Colorado  The resolution  titled  The Elections Don t Mean Shit—Vote Where the Power Is—Our Power Is In The Street  and adopted by the council  was prompted by the success of the Democratic National Convention protests in August 1968 and reflected Jacobs  strong advocacy of direct action   As part of the  National Action Staff   Jacobs was an integral part of the planning for what quickly came to be called  Four Days of Rage   For Jacobs  the goal of the  Days of Rage  was clear   Weatherman would shove the war down their dumb  fascist throats and show them  while we were at it  how much better we were than them  both tactically and strategically  as a people  In an all out civil war over Vietnam and other fascist U S  imperialism  we were going to bring the war home   Turn the imperialists  war into a civil war   in Lenin s words  And we were going to kick ass  In July 1969  30 members of Weatherman leadership traveled to Cuba and met with North Vietnamese representatives to gain from their revolutionary experience  The North Vietnamese requested armed political action in order to stop the U S  government s war in Vietnam  Subsequently  they accepted funding  training  recommendations on tactics and slogans from Cuba  and perhaps explosives as well   1 2  SDS Convention  December 1969  After the Days of Rage riots the Weatherman held the last of its National Council meetings from December 26 to December 31  1969 in Flint  Michigan  The meeting  dubbed the  War Council  by the 300 people who attended  adopted Jacobs  call for violent revolution  Dohrn opened the conference by telling the delegates they needed to stop being afraid and begin the  armed struggle   Over the next five days  the participants met in informal groups to discuss what  going underground  meant  how best to organize collectives  and justifications for violence  In the evening  the groups reconvened for a mass  wargasm —practicing karate  engaging in physical exercise  singing songs  and listening to speeches   The War Council ended with a major speech by John Jacobs  Jacobs condemned the  pacifism  of white middle class American youth  a belief which he claimed they held because they were insulated from the violence which afflicted blacks and the poor  He predicted a successful revolution  and declared that youth were moving away from passivity and apathy and toward a new high energy culture of  repersonalization  brought about by drugs  sex  and armed revolution   We re against everything that s  good and decent  in honky America   Jacobs said in his most commonly quoted statement   We will burn and loot and destroy  We are the incubation of your mother s nightmare    Two major decisions came out of the War Council  The first was to go underground  and to begin a violent  armed struggle against the state without attempting to organize or mobilize a broad swath of the public  The Weather Underground hoped to create underground collectives in major cities throughout the country  In fact  the Weathermen eventually created only three significant  active collectives  one in California  one in the Midwest  and one in New York City  The New York City collective was led by Jacobs and Terry Robbins  and included Ted Gold  Kathy Boudin  Cathy Wilkerson  Robbins  girlfriend   and Diana Oughton  Jacobs was one of Robbins  biggest supporters  and pushed Weatherman to let Robbins be as violent as he wanted to be  The Weatherman national leadership agreed  as did the New York City collective  The collective s first target was Judge John Murtagh  who was overseeing the trial of the  Panther 21    The second major decision was the dissolution of SDS  After the summer of 1969 fragmentation of SDS  Weatherman s adherents explicitly claimed themselves the real leaders of SDS and retained control of the SDS National Office  Thereafter  any leaflet  label  or logo bearing the name  Students for a Democratic Society   SDS  was in fact the views and politics of Weatherman  not of the slate elected by Progressive Labor  Weatherman contained the vast majority of former SDS National Committee members  including Mark Rudd  David Gilbert and Bernardine Dohrn  The group  while small  was able to commandeer the mantle of SDS and all of its membership lists  but with Weatherman in charge there was little or no support from local branches or members of the organization  and local chapters soon disbanded  At the War Council  the Weathermen had decided to close the SDS National Office  ending the major campus based organization of the 1960s which at its peak was a mass organization with 100 000 members   1 3  Ideology  The thesis of Weatherman theory  as expounded in its founding document  You Don t Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows  was that  the main struggle going on in the world today is between U S  imperialism and the national liberation struggles against it   based on Lenin s theory of imperialism  first expounded in 1916 in Imperialism  the Highest Stage of Capitalism  In Weatherman theory  oppressed peoples  are the creators of the wealth of empire   and it is to them that it belongs    The goal of revolutionary struggle must be the control and use of this wealth in the interest of the oppressed peoples of the world    The goal is the destruction of US imperialism and the achievement of a classless world  world communism   The Vietnamese and other third world countries  as well as third world people within the United States play a vanguard role  They  set the terms for class struggle in America      The role of the  Revolutionary Youth Movement  is to build a centralized organization of revolutionaries  a  Marxist Leninist Party  supported by a mass revolutionary movement to support international liberation movements and  open another battlefield of the revolution    The theoretical basis of the Revolutionary Youth Movement was an insight that most of the American population  including both students and the supposed  middle class   comprised  due to their relationship to the instruments of production  the working class  thus the organizational basis of the SDS  which had begun in the elite colleges and had been extended to public institutions as the organization grew could be extended to youth as a whole including students  those serving in the military  and the unemployed  Students could be viewed as workers gaining skills prior to employment  This contrasted to the Progressive Labor view which viewed students and workers as being in separate categories which could ally  but should not jointly organize   FBI analysis of the travel history of the founders and initial followers of the organization emphasized contacts with foreign governments  particularly the Cuban and North Vietnamese and their influence on the ideology of the organization  Participation in the Venceremos Brigade  a program which involved US students volunteering to work in the sugar harvest in Cuba  is highlighted as a common factor in the background of the founders of the Weather Underground  with China a secondary influence  This experience was cited by both Kathy Boudin and Bernardine Dohrn as a major influence on their political development   Terry Robbins took the organization s name from the lyrics of the Bob Dylan song  “Subterranean Homesick Blues ” which featured the lyrics “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows ” The lyrics had been quoted at the bottom of an influential essay in the SDS newspaper  New Left Notes  By using this title the Weathermen meant  partially  to appeal to the segment of US youth inspired to action for social justice by Dylan’s songs   The Weatherman group had long held that militancy was becoming more important than nonviolent forms of anti war action  and that university campus based demonstrations needed to be punctuated with more dramatic actions  which had the potential to interfere with the US military and internal security apparatus  The belief was that these types of urban guerrilla actions would act as a catalyst for the coming revolution  Many international events indeed seemed to support the Weathermen’s overall assertion that worldwide revolution was imminent  such as the tumultuous Cultural Revolution in China  the 1968 student revolts in France  Mexico City and elsewhere  the Prague Spring  the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  the emergence of the Tupamaros organization in Uruguay  the emergence of the Guinea Bissauan Revolution and similar Marxist led independence movements throughout Africa  and within the United States  the prominence of the Black Panther Party together with a series of “ghetto rebellions” throughout poor black neighborhoods across the country   The Weathermen were outspoken advocates of the critical concepts that later came to be known as “white privilege”  described as white skin privilege  and identity politics  As the unrest in poor black neighborhoods intensified in the early 1970s  Bernardine Dohrn said  “White youth must choose sides now  They must either fight on the side of the oppressed  or be on the side of the oppressor ”  1 4  Anti imperialism  anti racism  and white skin privilege  Weather maintained that their stance differed from the rest of the movement at the time in the sense that they predicated their critiques on the notion that they were engaged in  an anti imperialist  anti racist struggle   Weather put the international proletariat at the center of their political theory  Weather warned that other political theories  including those organizing around class interests or youth interests  were  bound to lead in a racist and chauvinist direction   Weather denounced other political theories of the time as  objectively racist  if they did not side with the international proletariat  such political theories  they argued  needed to be  smashed    Members of Weather further contended that efforts at  organizing whites against their own perceived oppression  were  attempts by whites to carve out even more privilege than they already derive from the imperialist nexus   Weather s political theory sought to make every struggle an anti imperialist  anti racist struggle  out of this premise came their interrogation of critical concepts that would later be known as  white privilege   As historian Dan Berger writes  Weather raised the question  what does it means to be a white person opposing racism and imperialism    1 5  Practice  Shortly after its formation as an independent group  Weatherman created a central committee  the Weather Bureau  which assigned its cadres to a series of collectives in major cities  These cities included New York  Boston  Seattle  Philadelphia  Cincinnati  Buffalo  and Chicago  the home of the SDS  head office  The collectives set up under the Weather Bureau drew their design from Che Guevara s foco theory  which focused on the building of small  semi autonomous cells guided by a central leadership   Members of collectives engaged in intensive criticism sessions which attempted to reconcile their prior and current activities and political positions to Weatherman doctrine  Monogamy and other exclusive sexual relationships came under attack  bisexuality was encouraged  Martial arts were practiced and occasional direct actions were engaged in  This formation continued during 1969 and 1970 until the group went underground and a more relaxed lifestyle was adopted as the group blended into the counterculture   1 6  Recruitment  Weather used various means by which to recruit new members and set into motion a nation wide revolt against the government  Weather members aimed to mobilize people into action against the established leaders of the nation and the patterns of injustice which existed in America and abroad due to America s presence overseas  They also aimed to convince people to resist reliance upon their given privilege and to rebel and take arms if necessary  According to Weatherman  if people tolerated the unjust actions of the state  they became complicit in those actions  In the manifesto compiled by Bill Ayers  Bernardine Dohrn  Jeff Jones  and Celia Sojourn  entitled  Prairie Fire  The Politics of Revolutionary Anti Imperialism   Weatherman explained that their intention was to encourage the people and provoke leaps in confidence and consciousness in an attempt to stir the imagination  organize the masses  and join in the people s day to day struggles in every way possible   In the year 1960  over a third of America’s population was under 18 years of age  The number of young citizens set the stage for a widespread revolt against perceived structures of racism  sexism  and classism  the violence of the Vietnam War and America’s interventions abroad  At college campuses throughout the country  anger against “the Establishment’s” practices prompted both peaceful and violent protest  The members of Weatherman targeted high school and college students  assuming they would be willing to rebel against the authoritative figures who had oppressed them  including cops  principals  and bosses  Weather aimed to develop roots within the class struggle  targeting white working class youths  The younger members of the working class became the focus of the organizing effort because they felt the oppression strongly in regards to the military draft  low wage jobs  and schooling   Schools became a common place of recruitment for the movement  In direct actions  dubbed Jailbreaks  Weather members invaded educational institutions as a means by which to recruit high school and college students  The motivation of these jailbreaks was the organization s belief that school was where the youth were oppressed by the system and where they learned to tolerate society’s faults instead of rise against them  According to “Prairie Fire”  young people are channeled  coerced  misled  miseducated  misused in the school setting  It is in schools that the youth of the nation become alienated from the authentic processes of learning about the world  Factions of the Weatherman organization began recruiting members by applying their own strategies  Women s groups such as The Motor City Nine and Cell 16 took the lead in various recruitment efforts  Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz  a member of the radical women s liberation group  Cell 16  spoke about her personal recruitment agenda saying that she wanted their group to go out in every corner of the country and tell women the truth  recruit the local people  poor and working class people  in order to build a new society  Berger explains the controversy surrounding recruitment strategies saying  “As an organizing strategy it was less than successful  white working class youths were more alienated than organized by Weather s spectacles  and even some of those interested in the group were turned off by its early hi jinks” The methods of recruitment applied by the Weathermen met controversy as their call to arms became intensely radical and their organization s leadership increasingly exclusive   1 6 1  Armed propaganda  In 2006 Dan Berger  writer  activist  and longtime anti racism organizer  states that following their initial set of bombings  which resulted in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion  the organization adopted a new paradigm of direct action set forth in the communiqué New Morning  Changing Weather  which abjured attacks on people  The shift in the organization s outlook was in good part due to the 1970 death of Weatherman Terry Robbins  Diana Oughton and Ted Gold  all graduate students  in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion  Terry Robbins was renowned among the organization members for his radicalism and belief in violence as effective action   According to Dan Berger a relatively sophisticated program of armed propaganda was adopted  This consisted of a series of bombings of government and corporate targets in retaliation for specific imperialist and oppressive acts  Small  well constructed time bombs were used  generally in vents in restrooms  which exploded at times the spaces were empty  Timely warnings were made and communiqués issued explaining the reason for the actions   2  Major activities and suspected activities  2 1  Haymarket Police Memorial bombing  Shortly before the Days of Rage demonstrations on October 6  1969  the Weatherman planted a bomb that blew up a statue in Chicago built to commemorate police casualties incurred in the 1886 Haymarket Riot  The blast broke nearly 100 windows and scattered pieces of the statue onto the Kennedy Expressway below  The statue was rebuilt and unveiled on May 4  1970  coincidentally  the same day as the Kent State massacre   only to be blown up by the Weathermen a second time on October 6  1970  The statue was rebuilt once again and Mayor Richard J  Daley posted a 24 hour police guard to protect it  however the statue was later destroyed again a third time  The monument was rebuilt and is located at Chicago Police Headquarters   2 2   Days of Rage   One of the first acts of the Weathermen after splitting from SDS was to announce they would hold the  Days of Rage  that autumn  This was advertised to  Bring the war home   Hoping to cause sufficient chaos to  wake  the American public out of what they saw as complacency toward the role of the US in the Vietnam War  the Weathermen meant it to be the largest protest of the decade  They had been told by their regional cadre to expect thousands to attend  however  when they arrived they found only a few hundred people   According to Bill Ayers in 2003   The Days of Rage was an attempt to break from the norms of kind of acceptable theatre of  here are the anti war people  containable  marginal  predictable  and here s the little path they re going to march down  and here s where they can make their little statement   We wanted to say   No  what we re going to do is whatever we had to do to stop the violence in Vietnam     The protests did not meet Ayers  stated expectations  Of the police   We were faced with revolutionaries  Of the city We never expected this kind of violent demonstration  There has always been a big difference between what they say and what they do  Headlines read  SDS Women Fight Cops  A comment in the press Here we see a new breed of pro black  pro Viet Cong hooligan revolutionaries who not demanding this or that change  but are out to totally disrupt the very fabric of this society  out the smash this social order  Though the October 8  1969 rally in Chicago had failed to draw as many as the Weathermen had anticipated  the two or three hundred who did attend shocked police by rioting through the affluent Gold Coast neighborhood  They smashed the windows of a bank and those of many cars  The crowd ran four blocks before encountering police barricades  They charged the police but broke into small groups  more than 1 000 police counter attacked  Many protesters were wearing motorcycle or football helmets  but the police were well trained and armed  Large amounts of tear gas were used  and at least twice police ran squad cars into the mob  The rioting lasted approximately half an hour  during which 28 policemen were injured  Six Weathermen were shot by the police and an unknown number injured  68 rioters were arrested   For the next two days  the Weathermen held no rallies or protests  Supporters of the RYM II movement  led by Klonsky and Noel Ignatin  held peaceful rallies in front of the federal courthouse  an International Harvester factory  and Cook County Hospital  The largest event of the Days of Rage took place on Friday  October 9  when RYM II led an interracial march of 2 000 people through a Spanish speaking part of Chicago   On October 10  the Weatherman attempted to regroup and resume their demonstrations  About 300 protesters marched through The Loop  Chicago s main business district  watched by a double line of heavily armed police  The protesters suddenly broke through the police lines and rampaged through the Loop  smashing the windows of cars and stores  The police were prepared  and quickly isolated the rioters  Within 15 minutes  more than half the crowd had been arrested   The Days of Rage cost Chicago and the state of Illinois approximately $183 000  $100 000 for National Guard expenses  $35 000 in damages  and $20 000 for one injured citizen s medical expenses   Most of the Weathermen and SDS leaders were now in jail  and the Weathermen would have to pay over $243 000 for their bail   2 3  Flint War Council  The Flint War Council was a series of meetings of the Weather Underground Organization and associates in Flint  Michigan  that took place from 27–31 December 1969  During these meetings  the decisions were made for the Weather Underground Organization to go underground and to  engage in guerilla warfare against the U S  government   This decision was made in response to increased pressure from law enforcement  and a belief that underground guerilla warfare was the best way to combat the U S  government   During a closed door meeting of the Weather Underground s leadership  the decision was also taken to abolish Students for a Democratic Society  This decision reflected the splintering of SDS into hostile rival factions   2 4  Park Precinct Police Station bombing  On February 16  1970 a nail bomb placed on a window ledge of the Park Police substation in the Upper Haight neighborhood of San Francisco exploded at 10 45 p m  The blast killed police Sergeant Brian McDonnell  Law enforcement suspected the Weather Underground but was unable to prove conclusively that the organization was involved  A second officer  Robert Fogarty  was partially blinded by the bomb’s shrapnel  Secret federal grand juries were convened in 2001 and again in 2009 to re open the Park Precinct cold case in an attempt to again tie WUO members Billy Ayers  Bernadine Dohrn  Howie Machtinger and others to the deadly bombing  Ultimately  it was concluded that members of the Black Liberation Army  whom WUO members affiliated with while underground  were responsible for not only this action but also the bombing of another police precinct in San Francisco as well as bombing the Catholic Church funeral services of the police officer killed in the Park Precinct bombing in the early summer of 1970   2 5  New York City arson attacks  On February 21  1970  at around 4 30 a m   three gasoline filled Molotov cocktails exploded in front of the home of New York Supreme Court Justice John M  Murtagh  who was presiding over the pretrial hearings of the so called  Panther 21  members of the Black Panther Party over a plot to bomb New York landmarks and department stores  Justice Murtagh and his family were unharmed  but two panes of a front window were shattered  an overhanging wooden eave was scorched  and the paint on a car in the garage was charred   Free the Panther 21  and  Viet Cong have won  were written in large red letters on the sidewalk in front of the judge s house at 529 W  217th Street in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan  The judge s house had been under hourly police surveillance and an unidentified woman called the police a few minutes before the explosions to report several prowlers there  which resulted in a police car being sent immediately to the scene   In the preceding hours  Molotov cocktails had been thrown at the second floor of Columbia University s International Law Library at 434 W  116th Street and at a police car parked across the street from the Charles Street police station in the West Village in Manhattan  and at Army and Navy recruiting booths on Norstrand Avenue on the eastern fringe of the Brooklyn College campus in Brooklyn  causing no or minimal damage in incidents of unknown relation to that at Judge Murtagh s home   According to the December 6  1970  New Morning—Changing Weather  Weather Underground communiqué signed by Bernardine Dohrn  and Cathy Wilkerson s 2007 memoir  the fire bombing of Judge Murtagh s home was carried out by four members of the New York cell that was decimated two weeks later by the March 6  1970 townhouse explosion   2 6  Greenwich Village townhouse explosion  On March 6  1970  during preparations for the bombing of a Non Commissioned Officers’  NCO  dance at the Fort Dix U S  Army base and for Butler Library at Columbia University  there was an explosion in a Greenwich Village safe house when the nail bomb being constructed prematurely detonated for unknown reasons  WUO members Diana Oughton  Ted Gold  and Terry Robbins died in the explosion  Cathy Wilkerson and Kathy Boudin escaped unharmed  The site of the Village explosion was the former residence of Merrill Lynch brokerage firm co founder Charles Merrill and the childhood home of his son  poet James Merrill  the younger Merrill subsequently memorialized the event in his poem 18 West 11th Street  the title being the address of the brownstone townhouse  Another writer  Matthew Landy Steen  composed a widely reprinted poem How Does It Feel To Be Inside An Explosion   An FBI report later stated that the group had possessed enough explosives to  level     both sides of the street   Dustin Hoffman was seen wandering the street afterwards  he lived in the townhouse next door   The bomb preparations have been pointed out by critics of the claim that the Weatherman group did not try to take lives with its bombings  Harvey Klehr  the Andrew W  Mellon professor of politics and history at Emory University in Atlanta  said in 2003   The only reason they were not guilty of mass murder is mere incompetence  I don t know what sort of defense that is    2 6 1  Underground strategy change  After the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion  per the December 1969 Flint war council decisions the group was now well underground  and began to refer to themselves as the Weather Underground Organization  At this juncture  WUO shrank considerably  becoming even fewer than they had been when first formed  The group was devastated by the loss of their friends  and in late April 1970  members of the Weathermen met in California to discuss what had happened in New York and the future of the organization  The group decided to reevaluate their strategy  particularly regarding their initial belief in the acceptability of human casualties  and rejected such tactics as kidnapping and assassinations   In 2003  Weather Underground members stated in interviews that they wanted to convince the American public that the United States was truly responsible for the calamity in Vietnam  The group began striking at night  bombing empty offices  with warnings always issued in advance to ensure a safe evacuation  According to David Gilbert  who took part in the 1981 Brink s robbery that killed 2 police officers and a Brinks  guard  and was jailed for murder    their  goal was to not hurt any people  and a lot of work went into that  But we wanted to pick targets that showed to the public who was responsible for what was really going on   After the Greenwich Village explosion  in a review of the documentary film The Weather Underground  2002   a Guardian journalist restated   despite the obvious dangers of building and transporting huge shrapnel bombs   the film s contention that no one was killed by WUO bombs   2 7  Declaration of war  In response to the death of Black Panther members Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in December  1969 during a police raid  on May 21  1970 the Weather Underground issued a  Declaration of War  against the United States government  using for the first time its new name  the  Weather Underground Organization   WUO   adopting fake identities  and pursuing covert activities only  These initially included preparations for a bombing of a U S  military non commissioned officers  dance at Fort Dix  New Jersey in what Brian Flanagan said had been intended to be  the most horrific hit the United States government had ever suffered on its territory    Bernardine Dohrn subsequently stated that it was Fred Hampton s death that prompted the Weather Underground to declare war on the US government   In December 1969  the Chicago Police Department  in conjunction with the FBI  conducted a raid on the home of Black Panther Fred Hampton  in which he and Mark Clark were killed  with four of the seven other people in the apartment wounded  The survivors of the raid were all charged with assault and attempted murder  The police claimed they shot in self defense  although a controversy arose when the Panthers  other activists and a Chicago newspaper reporter presented visual evidence  as well as the testimony of an FBI ballistics expert  showing that the sleeping Panthers were not resisting arrest and only fired one shot  as opposed to the more than one hundred the police fired into the apartment  The charges were later dropped  and the families of the dead won a $1 8 million settlement from the government  It was discovered in 1971 that Hampton had been targeted by the FBI s COINTELPRO  True to Dohrn s words  this single event  in the continuing string of public killings of black leaders of any political stripe  was the trigger that pushed a large number of Weatherman and other students who had just attended the last SDS national convention months earlier to go underground and develop its logistical support network nationally   On May 21  1970  a communiqué from the Weather Underground was issued promising to attack a  symbol or institution of American injustice  within two weeks  The communiqué included taunts towards the FBI  daring them to try and find the group  whose members were spread throughout the United States  Many leftist organizations showed curiosity in the communiqué  and waited to see if the act would in fact occur  However  two weeks would pass without any occurrence  Then on June 9  1970  their first publicly acknowledged bombing occurred at a New York City police station  saying it was  in outraged response to the assassination of the Soledad Brother George Jackson   who had recently been killed by prison guards in an escape attempt  The FBI placed the Weather Underground organization on the ten most wanted list by the end of 1970   2 8  NYC Police bombing  On June 9  1970  a bomb made with ten sticks of dynamite exploded in the New York City Police Headquarters  The explosion was preceded by a warning about six minutes prior to the detonation and subsequently by a WUO claim of responsibility   2 9  Indictment of leaders  On July 23  1970  a Detroit federal grand jury indicted 13 Weathermen members in a national bombing conspiracy  along with several unnamed co conspirators  Ten of the thirteen already had outstanding federal warrants   2 10  Timothy Leary prison break  In September 1970  the group accepted a $20 000 payment from the largest international psychedelics distribution organization  called The Brotherhood of Eternal Love  to break LSD advocate Timothy Leary out of a California prison in San Luis Obispo  north of Santa Barbara  California  and transport him and his wife to Algeria  where Leary joined Eldridge Cleaver  Rumors also circulated that the funds were donated by an internationally known female folk singer in Los Angeles or by Elephant s Memory  which was John Lennon s backup band in New York City and was a factor with the attempted deportation of Lennon  who had donated bail money for radical groups   2 11  FBI s Most Wanted List  In October 1970  Bernardine Dohrn was put on the FBI s Ten Most Wanted List  2 12  Pentagon bombing  On May 19  1972  Ho Chi Minh’s birthday  the Weather Underground placed a bomb in the women’s bathroom in the Air Force wing of the Pentagon  The damage caused flooding that destroyed computer tapes holding classified information  Other radical groups worldwide applauded the bombing  illustrated by German youths protesting against American military systems in Frankfurt  This was  in retaliation for the U S  bombing raid in Hanoi    2 13  Withdrawal of charges  In 1973  the government requested dropping charges against most of the WUO members  The requests cited a recent decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that barred electronic surveillance without a court order  This Supreme Court decision would hamper any prosecution of the WUO cases  In addition  the government did not want to reveal foreign intelligence secrets that a trial would require  Bernardine Dohrn was removed from the FBI s Ten Most Wanted List  The initial federal district court cases  and federal appellate decisions  upholding the decisions of the lower courts  originated in federal grand jury proceedings in Seattle and Portland investigating Matthew Steen  who had been arrested on federal bank robbery and conspiracy charges in Seattle in 1971  As with the earlier federal grand juries that subpoenaed Leslie Bacon and Stew Albert in the U S  Capitol bombing case  these investigations were known as  fishing expeditions   with the evidence gathered through  black bag  jobs including illegal mail openings that involved the FBI and U S  Postal Service  burglaries by FBI field offices  and electronic surveillance by the Central Intelligence Agency against the support network  friends  and family members of the Weather Underground as part of Nixon s COINTELPRO apparatus  In the case of Steen  a special federal grand jury was convened and directed by Guy Goodwin and Robert Mardian  Nixon appointed heads of the Internal Security Division of the Justice Department  Mardian was later convicted in the COINTELPRO scandal but had his conviction reversed  During the time Steen was in a federal prison  the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Church Committee convened to investigate these domestic spying abuses while the Weather Underground remained fugitives   These grand juries caused Sylvia Jane Brown  Robert Gelbhard  and future members of the Seattle Weather Collective to be subpoenaed in Seattle and Portland for the investigation of one of the first  and last  captured WUO members  Steen was also suspected in the U S  Capitol bombing  several attempted embassy bombings in Washington  D C  in 1971  and participation in the break in at the FBI office in Media  PA  that resulted in the release of numerous secret FBI files to the print media and which outlined the broad array of illegal domestic spying activities conducted by numerous federal agencies under the rubric of Cointelpro  Refusing to testify  all were incarcerated for the 18 month life of the special tribunal and later freed on appeal due to suspected wiretappings and mail openings  Four months afterwards the cases were dismissed The decisions in these cases led directly to the subsequent resignation of FBI Director  L  Patrick Gray  and the federal indictments of W  Mark Felt or  Deep Throat  and Edwin Miller and which  earlier  was the factor leading to the dismissal of federal  most wanted  charges against members of the Weather Underground leadership in 1973  Steen was sentenced to two consecutive five year terms in federal prison  his conviction later commuted by President Jimmy Carter under his amnesty program  2 14  Prairie Fire  With the help from Clayton Van Lydegraf  the Weather Underground sought a more Marxist Leninist ideological approach to the post Vietnam reality  The leading members of the Weather Underground  Bill Ayers  Bernardine Dohrn  Jeff Jones  and Celia Sojourn  collaborated on ideas and published their manifesto  Prairie Fire  The Politics of Revolutionary Anti Imperialism  The name came from a quote by Mao Zedong   a single spark can set a prairie fire   By the summer of 1974  5 000 copies had surfaced in coffee houses  bookstores and public libraries across America  Leftist newspapers praised the manifesto   Abbie Hoffman publicly praised Prairie Fire and believed every American should be given a copy  The manifesto’s influence initiated the formation of the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee in several American cities  Hundreds of above ground activists helped further the new political vision of the Weather Underground  Among other things  the manifesto called for the violent overthrow of the U S  government and the establishment of a Dictatorship of the Proletariat as a means to achieving its social goals   The only path to the final defeat of imperialism and the building of socialism is revolutionary war     Socialism is the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie  the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat  and the eradication of the social system based on profit     Revolutionary war will be complicated and protracted     It includes mass struggle and clandestine struggle  peaceful and violent  political and economic  cultural and military  where all forms are developed in harmony with the armed struggle  Without mass struggle there can be no revolution  Without armed struggle there can be no victory  Essentially  after the 1969 failure of the Days of Rage to involve thousands of youth in massive street fighting  Weather renounced most of the Left and decided to operate as an isolated underground group  Prairie Fire urged people to never  dissociate mass struggle from revolutionary violence   To do so  claimed Weather  was to do the state s work  Just as in 1969 70  Weather still refused to renounce revolutionary violence for  to leave people unprepared to fight the state is to seriously mislead them about the inevitable nature of what lies ahead   However  the decision to build only an underground group caused the Weather Underground to lose sight of its commitment to mass struggle and made future alliances with the mass movement difficult and tenuous   By 1974  Weather had recognized this shortcoming and in Prairie Fire detailed a different strategy for the 1970s which demanded both mass and clandestine organizations  The role of the clandestine organization would be to build the  consciousness of action  and prepare the way for the development of a people s militia  Concurrently  the role of the mass movement  i e   above ground Prairie Fire collective  would include support for  and encouragement of  armed action  Such an alliance would  according to Weather   help create the  sea  for the guerrillas to swim in    According to Bill Ayers in the late 1970s  the Weatherman group further split into two factions — the May 19th Communist Organization and the  Prairie Fire Collective  — with Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers in the latter  The Prairie Fire Collective favored coming out of hiding and establishing an above ground revolutionary mass movement  With most WUO members facing the limited criminal charges  most charges had been dropped by the government in 1973  against them creating an above ground organization was more feasible  The May 19 Communist Organization continued in hiding as the clandestine organization  A decisive factor in Dohrn s coming out of hiding were her concerns about her children  Bill Ayers   Fugitive Days  Memoirs of An Antiwar Activist   Beacon Press  2001  978 0 8070 3277 0   The Prairie Fire Collective faction started to surrender to the authorities from the late 1970s to the early 1980s  The remaining Weather Underground members continued to attack US institutions   2 15  Cointelpro  In April 1971  the  Citizens  Commission to Investigate the FBI  broke into an FBI office in Media  Pennsylvania  The group stole files with several hundred pages  The files detailed the targeting of civil rights leaders  labor rights organizations  and left wing groups in general  and included documentation of acts of intimidation and disinformation by the FBI  and attempts to erode public support for those popular movements  By the end of April  the FBI offices were to terminate all files dealing with leftist groups  The files were a part of an FBI program called Cointelpro   After Cointelpro was dissolved in 1971 by J  Edgar Hoover  the FBI continued its counterintelligence on groups like the Weather Underground  In 1973  the FBI established the  Special Target Information Development  program  where agents were sent undercover to penetrate the Weather Underground  Due to the illegal tactics of FBI agents involved with the program  government attorneys requested all weapons  and bomb related charges be dropped against the Weather Underground  The most well publicized of these tactics were the  black bag jobs   referring to searches conducted in the homes of relatives and acquaintances of Weatherman  The Weather Underground was no longer a fugitive organization and could turn themselves in with minimal charges against them  Additionally  the illegal domestic spying conducted by the CIA in collaboration with the FBI also lessened the legal repercussions for Weatherman turning themselves in   After the Church Committee revealed the FBI s illegal activities  many agents were investigated  In 1976  former FBI Associate Director W  Mark Felt publicly stated he had ordered break ins and that individual agents were merely obeying orders and should not be punished for it  Felt also stated that acting Director L  Patrick Gray had also authorized the break ins  but Gray denied this  Felt said on the CBS television program Face the Nation that he would probably be a  scapegoat  for the Bureau s work   I think this is justified and I d do it again tomorrow   he said on the program  While admitting the break ins were  extralegal   he justified it as protecting the  greater good   Felt said   To not take action against these people and know of a bombing in advance would simply be to stick your fingers in your ears and protect your eardrums when the explosion went off and then start the investigation  The Attorney General in the new Carter administration  Griffin B  Bell  investigated  and on April 10  1978  a federal grand jury charged Felt  Edward S  Miller  and Gray with conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by searching their homes without warrants  The case did not go to trial and was dropped by the government for lack of evidence on December 11  1980  The indictment charged violations of Title 18  Section 241 of the United States Code  The indictment charged Felt and the others  did unlawfully  willfully  and knowingly combine  conspire  confederate  and agree together and with each other to injure and oppress citizens of the United States who were relatives and acquaintances of the Weatherman fugitives  in the free exercise and enjoyments of certain rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America  Felt and Miller attempted to plea bargain with the government  willing to agree to a misdemeanor guilty plea to conducting searches without warrants—a violation of 18 U S C  sec  2236—but the government rejected the offer in 1979  After eight postponements  the case against Felt and Miller went to trial in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 18  1980  On October 29  former President Richard Nixon appeared as a rebuttal witness for the defense  and testified that presidents since Franklin D  Roosevelt had authorized the bureau to engage in break ins while conducting foreign intelligence and counterespionage investigations   It was Nixon s first courtroom appearance since his resignation in 1974  Nixon also contributed money to Felt s legal defense fund  with Felt s legal expenses running over $600 000  Also testifying were former Attorneys General Herbert Brownell  Jr   Nicholas Katzenbach  Ramsey Clark  John N  Mitchell  and Richard G  Kleindienst  all of whom said warrantless searches in national security matters were commonplace and not understood to be illegal  but Mitchell and Kleindienst denied they had authorized any of the break ins at issue in the trial   The jury returned guilty verdicts on November 6  1980  Although the charge carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison  Felt was fined $5 000   Miller was fined $3 500   Writing in The New York Times a week after the conviction  Roy Cohn claimed that Felt and Miller were being used as scapegoats by the Carter administration and that it was an unfair prosecution  Cohn wrote it was the  final dirty trick  and that there had been no  personal motive  to their actions   The Times saluted the convictions  saying that it showed  the case has established that zeal is no excuse for violating the Constitution   Felt and Miller appealed the verdict  and they were later pardoned by Ronald Reagan   3  Dissolution  Despite the change in their legal status  the Weather Underground remained underground for a few more years  However  by 1976 the organization was disintegrating  The Weather Underground held a conference in Chicago called Hard Times  The idea was to create an umbrella organization for all radical groups  However  the event turned sour when Hispanic and Black groups accused the Weather Underground and the Prairie Fire Committee of limiting their roles in racial issues  The Weather Underground faced accusations of abandonment of the revolution by reversing their original ideology   The conference increased divisions within the Weather Underground  East coast members favored a commitment to violence and challenged commitments of old leaders  Bernardine Dohrn  Bill Ayers  and Jeff Jones  These older members found they were no longer liable for federal prosecution because of illegal wire taps and the government s unwillingness to reveal sources and methods favored a strategy of inversion where they would be above ground  revolutionary leaders   Jeremy Varon argues that by 1977 the WUO had disbanded   Another factor in the surfacing of the Prairie Fire WUO members was an appearance by Matthew Steen on the lead segment of CBS  60 Minutes in late 1977 about Weather Underground and logistical support  the first ex Weatherman interview on national television  Steen  in the interview with Dan Rather  stated that  it was necessary  for Weathermen fugitives  to re emerge and engage change at the community level in a post Vietnam  post draft era   This was viewed by more than 45 million households  including President Jimmy Carter  who later granted amnesty to some WUO members as well as by David Byrne  composer for the popular rock band Talking Heads  who wrote a song  Life During Wartime  encapsulating the episode into popular mass culture This 60 Minutes segment also provoked a new Congressional inquiry into the practices of the U S  Passport Office and directly led to the resignation of the head of this office for issuing passports that ended up in Weather Underground  Within 60 days of the 60 Minutes interview  Weather Underground leader Mark Rudd turned himself in to authorities  and within 18 months the entire WUO leadership had surfaced   The federal government estimated that only 38 Weathermen had gone underground in 1970  though the estimates varied widely  according to a variety of official and unofficial sources  as between 50 to 600 members  Most modern sources lean towards a much larger number than the FBI reference  An FBI estimate in 1976  or slightly later  of then current membership was down to 30 or fewer   3 1  Plot to bomb office of California Senator  In November 1977 five WUO members were arrested on conspiracy to bomb the office of California State Senator John Briggs  It was later revealed that the Revolutionary Committee and PFOC had been infiltrated by the FBI for almost six years  FBI agents Richard J  Gianotti and William D  Reagan lost their cover in November when federal judges needed their testimony to issue warrants for the arrest of Clayton Van Lydegraf and four Weather people  The arrests were the results of the infiltration  WUO members Judith Bissell  Thomas Justesen  Leslie Mullin  and Marc Curtis pled guilty while Clayton Van Lydegraf  who helped write the 1974 Prairie Fire Manifesto  went to trial   Within two years  many members turned themselves in after taking advantage of President Jimmy Carter s amnesty for draft dodgers  Mark Rudd turned himself in to authorities on January 20  1978  Rudd was fined $4 000 and received two years probation  Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers turned themselves in on December 3  1980  in New York  with substantial media coverage  Charges were dropped for Ayers  Dohrn received three years probation and a $15 000 fine   3 2  Brinks robbery  Some members remained underground and joined splinter radical groups  The US government states that three members of the Weather Underground  Kathy Boudin  Judith Alice Clark  and David Gilbert  joined the May 19 Communist Organization  On October 20  1981 in Nanuet  New York  the group robbed a Brinks armored truck containing $1 6 million  The robbery was violent  resulting in the murders of two police officers and a security guard   Boudin  Clark  and Gilbert were found guilty and sentenced to lengthy terms in prison  Media reports listed them as former Weatherman Underground members considered the “last gasps” of the Weather Underground  The documentary The Weather Underground described the Brinks Robbery as the  unofficial end  of the Weather Underground   3 3  May 19th Communist Organization  The Weather Underground members involved in the May 19th Communist Organization alliance with the Black Liberation Army continued in a series of jail breaks  armed robberies and bombings until most members were finally arrested in 1985 and sentenced as part of the Brinks robbery and the Resistance Conspiracy case   4  Coalitions with non WUO members  Throughout the underground years  the Weather Underground members worked closely with their counterparts in other organizations  including Jane Alpert  to bring attention their further actions to the press  She helped Weatherman pursue their main goal of overthrowing the U S  government through her writings  However  there were tensions within the organization  brought about by her famous manifesto   Mother Right   that specifically called on the Weatherwomen to focus on their own cause other than anti imperialism  Weather members then wrote in response to her manifesto   5  Legacy  Widely known members of the Weather Underground include Kathy Boudin  Linda Sue Evans  Brian Flanagan  David Gilbert  Ted Gold  Naomi Jaffe  Jeff Jones  Joe Kelly  Diana Oughton  Eleanor Raskin  Terry Robbins  Mark Rudd  Matthew Steen  Susan Stern  Laura Whitehorn  Cathy Wilkerson  and the still married couple Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers  Most former Weathermen have successfully re integrated into mainstream society  without necessarily repudiating their original intent   The Weather Underground was referred to in its own time and afterwards as a terrorist group  A few police officers were allegedly killed by the group  one killed by a pipe bomb and another 2  plus a guard  by a robbery gone wrong  though the investigation of the first is still open and the latter was a robbery conducted by former members of the group after the group had dissolved   The group also fell under the auspices of the FBI New York City Police Anti Terrorist Task Force  a forerunner of the FBI s Joint Terrorism Task Forces  The FBI  on its website  describes the organization as having been a  domestic terrorist group   but no longer an active concern  Others either dispute or clarify the categorization  or justify the group s violence as an appropriate response to the Vietnam war  domestic racism and the assassinations of black leaders   In his 2001 book about his Weatherman experiences  Bill Ayers stated his objection to describing the WUO as terrorist  Ayers wrote   Terrorists terrorize  they kill innocent civilians  while we organized and agitated  Terrorists destroy randomly  while our actions bore  we hoped  the precise stamp of a cut diamond  Terrorists intimidate  while we aimed only to educate  No  we re not terrorists   Dan Berger  in his book about the Weatherman  Outlaws in America  comments that the group  purposefully and successfully avoided injuring anyone    Its war against property by definition means that the WUO was not a terrorist organization    However  their claims that they never attacked or intended to attack people are disputed by others  Weather Underground member Mark Rudd  reminiscing in 2005 about the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion  said   On the morning of March 6  1970  three of my comrades were building pipe bombs packed with dynamite and nails  destined for a dance of non commissioned officers and their dates at Fort Dix  N J   that night   Harvey Klehr  the Andrew W  Mellon professor of politics and history at Emory University in Atlanta  said in 2003   The only reason they were not guilty of mass murder is mere incompetence  I don t know what sort of defense that is    Bill Ayers  a retired professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago  was quoted in an interview to say  I don t regret setting bombs  but has since claimed he was misquoted  During the presidential election campaign of 2008  several candidates questioned Barack Obama s contacts with Ayers  including Hillary Clinton  John McCain and Sarah Palin  Ayers responded in December 2008  after Obama s election victory  in an op ed piece in The New York Times   Brian Flanagan has expressed regret for his actions during the Weatherman years  and compared the group s activities to terrorism  Flanagan said   When you feel that you have right on your side  you can do some pretty horrific things   Mark Rudd  now a teacher of mathematics at Central New Mexico Community College  has said he has  mixed feelings  and feelings of  guilt and shame    A faction of the Weather Underground continues today as the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee  Their official site reads   The site further supports armed violence   6  See also  List of Weather Collectives  List of Weatherman actions  May 19th Communist Organization  Osawatomie  periodical   Resistance Conspiracy case
