Obsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed as an extrusive igneous rock   It is produced when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimum crystal growth  Obsidian is commonly found within the margins of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows  where the chemical composition  high silica content  induces a high viscosity and polymerization degree of the lava  The inhibition of atomic diffusion through this highly viscous and polymerized lava explains the lack of crystal growth  Obsidian is hard and brittle  it therefore fractures with very sharp edges  which were used in the past in cutting and piercing tools  and has been used experimentally as surgical scalpel blades   1  Origin and properties  The translation into English of Natural History written by the elder Pliny of Rome shows a few sentences on the subject of a volcanic glass called Obsian  so named from its resemblance to a stone found in Ethiopia by Obsius  obsiānus lapis    Obsidian is the rock formed as a result of cooled lava  which is the parent material  Having a low water content when newly formed typically less than 1% water by weight  becomes progressively hydrated when exposed to groundwater  forming perlite  Tektites were once thought by many to be obsidian produced by lunar volcanic eruptions  though few scientists now adhere to this hypothesis   Obsidian is mineral like  but not a true mineral because as a glass it is not crystalline  in addition  its composition is too complex to comprise a single mineral  It is sometimes classified as a mineraloid  Though obsidian is usually dark in color similar to mafic rocks such as basalt  obsidian s composition is extremely felsic  Obsidian consists mainly of SiO2  silicon dioxide   usually 70% or more  Crystalline rocks with obsidian s composition include granite and rhyolite  Because obsidian is metastable at the Earth s surface  over time the glass becomes fine grained mineral crystals   no obsidian has been found that is older than Cretaceous age  This breakdown of obsidian is accelerated by the presence of water   Pure obsidian is usually dark in appearance  though the color varies depending on the presence of impurities  Iron and magnesium typically give the obsidian a dark brown to black color  Very few samples are nearly colorless  In some stones  the inclusion of small  white  radially clustered crystals of cristobalite in the black glass produce a blotchy or snowflake pattern  snowflake obsidian   It may contain patterns of gas bubbles remaining from the lava flow  aligned along layers created as the molten rock was flowing before being cooled  These bubbles can produce interesting effects such as a golden sheen  sheen obsidian   An iridescent  rainbow like sheen  rainbow obsidian  is caused by inclusions of magnetite nanoparticles  Nadin  2007    2  Occurrence  Obsidian can be found in locations which have experienced rhyolitic eruptions  It can be found in Argentina  Armenia  Azerbaijan  Canada  Chile  Georgia  Greece  El Salvador  Guatemala  Iceland  Italy  Japan  Kenya  Mexico  New Zealand  Peru  Scotland  Turkey and the United States  Obsidian flows which may be hiked on are found within the calderas of Newberry Volcano and Medicine Lake Volcano in the Cascade Range of western North America  and at Inyo Craters east of the Sierra Nevada in California  Yellowstone National Park has a mountainside containing obsidian located between Mammoth Hot Springs and the Norris Geyser Basin  and deposits can be found in many other western U S  states including Arizona  Colorado  New Mexico  Texas  Utah  Washington  Oregon and Idaho  Obsidian can also be found in the eastern U S  states of Virginia  as well as Pennsylvania and North Carolina   There are only four major deposit areas in the central Mediterranean  Lipari  Pantelleria  Palmarola and Monte Arci   Ancient sources in the Aegean were Melos and Giali   Acigöl town and the Göllü Dağ volcano were the most important sources in central Anatolia  one of the more important source areas in prehistoric Near East   3  Historical use  The first archaeological evidence known of usage were made from within Kariandusi and other sites of the Acheulian age  beginning 1 5 million years previously  dated 700 000 BC  although the number of objects found at these sites were very low relative to the Neolithic  Use of obsidian in pottery of the Neolithic in the area around Lipari was found to be significantly less at a distance representing two weeks journeying  Anatolian sources of obsidian are known to have been the material used in the Levant and modern day Iraqi Kurdistan from a time beginning sometime about 12 500 BC  The first attested civilized use is from excavations at Tell Brak dated the late fifth millennia  Obsidian was valued in Stone Age cultures because  like flint  it could be fractured to produce sharp blades or arrowheads  Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks  obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture  It was also polished to create early mirrors  Modern archaeologists have developed a relative dating system  obsidian hydration dating  to calculate the age of obsidian artifacts   3 1  Middle East  In the Ubaid in the 5th millennium BC  blades were manufactured from obsidian mined in what is now Turkey  Ancient Egyptians used obsidian imported from the eastern Mediterranean and southern Red Sea regions  Obsidian was also used in ritual circumcisions because of its deftness and sharpness  In the eastern Mediterranean area the material was used to make tools  mirrors and decorative objects   Obsidian has also been found in Gilat  a site in the western Negev in Israel  Eight obsidian artifacts dating to the Chalcolithic Age found at this site were traced to obsidian sources in Anatolia  Neutron activation analysis  NAA  on the obsidian found at this site helped to reveal trade routes and exchange networks previously unknown   3 2  Americas  Lithic analysis can be instrumental in understanding prehispanic groups in Mesoamerica  A careful analysis of obsidian in a culture or place can be of considerable use to reconstruct commerce  production  distribution and thereby understand economic  social and political aspects of a civilization  This is the case in Yaxchilán  a Maya city where even warfare implications have been studied linked with obsidian use and its debris  Another example is the archeological recovery at coastal Chumash sites in California indicating considerable trade with the distant site of Casa Diablo  California in the Sierra Nevada Mountains   Pre Columbian Mesoamericans  use of obsidian was extensive and sophisticated  including carved and worked obsidian for tools and decorative objects  Mesoamericans also made a type of sword with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body  Called a macuahuitl  the weapon was capable of inflicting terrible injuries  combining the sharp cutting edge of an obsidian blade with the ragged cut of a serrated weapon   Native American people traded obsidian throughout the Americas  Each volcano and in some cases each volcanic eruption produces a distinguishable type of obsidian  making it possible for archaeologists to trace the origins of a particular artifact  Similar tracing techniques have allowed obsidian to be identified in Greece also as coming from Melos  Nisyros or Yiali  islands in the Aegean Sea  Obsidian cores and blades were traded great distances inland from the coast   In Chile obsidian tools from Chaitén Volcano have been found as far away as in Chan Chan 400 km north of the volcano and also in sites 400 km south of it   3 3  Easter Island  Obsidian was also used on Rapa Nui  Easter Island  for edged tools such as Mataia and the pupils of the eyes of their Moai  statues    4  Current use  Though not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration  FDA  for use on humans  obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades  as well crafted obsidian blades have a cutting edge many times sharper than high quality steel surgical scalpels  the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick  Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged  irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope  when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even  One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue at 7 days  in a group of rats  Don Crabtree produced obsidian blades for surgery and other purposes  and has written articles on the subject  Obsidian scalpels may currently be purchased for surgical use on research animals   Obsidian is also used for ornamental purposes and as a gemstone  It presents a different appearance depending on how it is cut  in one direction it is jet black  while in another it is glistening gray   Apache tears  are small rounded obsidian nuggets embedded within a grayish white perlite matrix   Plinths for audio turntables have been made of obsidian since the 1970s  e g  the grayish black SH 10B3 plinth by Technics   5
