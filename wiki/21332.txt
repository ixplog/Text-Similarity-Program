The Netherlands Antilles  Dutch  Nederlandse Antillen   Papiamentu  Antia Hulandes   also referred to informally as the Dutch Antilles  was an autonomous Caribbean country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands  Although the country has now been dissolved  all of its constituent islands remain part of the kingdom under a different legal status and the term is still used to refer to these Dutch Caribbean islands   The Netherlands Antilles consisted of two distinct island groups  First  the  windward  or  ABC Islands  — Aruba  Bonaire  and Curaçao — are located in the southern Caribbean Sea  just off the Venezuelan coast  Second  the  leeward  or  SSS islands  — Sint Maarten  Saba  and Sint Eustatius — are part of the Lesser Antilles  they are approximately northeast of the ABC Islands  The Dutch colonized the various islands in the 17th century and united them as the Netherlands Antilles in 1954   The Netherlands Antilles was dissolved on 10 October 2010  Curaçao and Sint Maarten became distinct constituent countries alongside Aruba which had become a distinct constituent country in 1986  whereas Bonaire  Sint Eustatius  and Saba  the  BES Islands   became special municipalities within the Netherlands proper   1  History  Spanish sponsored explorers discovered both the leeward  Alonso de Ojeda  1499  and windward  Christopher Columbus  1493  island groups  but Spain founded settlements only in the leeward islands  In the 17th century  the islands were conquered by the Dutch West India Company and were used as military outposts and trade bases  From the last quarter of the 17th century  the group consisted of six undisputedly Dutch islands  Curaçao  settled in 1634   Aruba  settled in 1636   Bonaire  settled in 1636   Sint Eustatius  settled in 1636   Saba  settled in 1640  and Sint Maarten  settled in 1648   Before  Anguilla  1631–1650   the present day British Virgin Islands  1612–1672   St  Croix and Tobago had also been Dutch   In the second half of the 18th century Sint Eustatius became the commercial hub of the north eastern Caribbean  earning the nickname  The Golden Rock   This invoked the envy of the French and English who from 1795 made sure the island lost that position by occupying the island and ruining it—the French through their taxes and the English by closing the island off and diverting all trade to their own islands   From 1815 onwards  Curaçao and Dependencies formed a colony of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  Slavery was abolished in 1863  and in 1865 a government regulation for Curaçao was enacted that allowed for some very limited autonomy for the colony  Though this regulation was replaced by a constitution    in 1936  the changes to the government structure remained superficial  and Curaçao continued to be ruled as a colony   The island of Curaçao was hit hard by the abolition of slavery in 1863  Its prosperity  and that of neighboring Aruba  was restored in the early 20th century with the construction of oil refineries to service the newly discovered Venezuelan oil fields   Colonial rule ended after the conclusion of the Second World War  Queen Wilhelmina had promised in a 1942 speech to offer autonomy to the overseas territories of the Netherlands  and British and American occupation—with consent by the Dutch government—of the islands during the war led to increasing demands for autonomy within the population as well   In May 1948  a new constitution for the territory entered into force  allowing the largest amount of autonomy allowed under the Dutch constitution of 1922  Among others  universal suffrage was introduced  The territory was renamed to  Netherlands Antilles  as well  After the Dutch constitution was revised in 1948  a new interim Constitution of the Netherlands Antilles was enacted in February 1951  Shortly thereafter  on 3 March 1951  the Island Regulation of the Netherlands Antilles    was issued by royal decree  giving fairly large autonomy to the various island territories in the Netherlands Antilles  A consolidated version of this regulation remained in force until the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010   The new constitution was only deemed an interim arrangement  as negotiations for a Charter for the Kingdom were already underway  On 15 December 1954  the Netherlands Antilles  Suriname  and the Netherlands acceded as equal partners to an overarching Kingdom of the Netherlands as established in the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands  With this move  the United Nations deemed decolonization of the territory complete and removed it from the United Nations list of Non Self Governing Territories  Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles on 1 January 1986  paving the way for a series of referendums among the remaining islands on the future of the Netherlands Antilles  Whereas the ruling parties campaigned for the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles  the people voted for a restructuring of the Netherlands Antilles  The coalition campaigning for this option became the Party for the Restructured Antilles  which ruled the Netherlands Antilles for much of the time until its dissolution on 10 October 2010   1 1  Dissolution  Even though the referendums held in the early 1990s resulted in a position in favour of retaining the Netherlands Antilles  the arrangement continued to be an unhappy one  Between June 2000 and April 2005  each island of the Netherlands Antilles had a new referendum on its future status  The four options that could be voted on were the following   closer ties with the Netherlands  remaining within the Netherlands Antilles  autonomy as a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands  status aparte   independence Of the five islands  Sint Maarten and Curaçao voted for status aparte  Saba and Bonaire voted for closer ties to the Netherlands  and Sint Eustatius voted to stay within the Netherlands Antilles   On 26 November 2005  a Round Table Conference  RTC  was held between the governments of the Netherlands  Aruba  the Netherlands Antilles  and each island in the Netherlands Antilles  The final statement to emerge from the RTC stated that autonomy for Curaçao and Sint Maarten  plus a new status for Bonaire  Sint Eustatius  and Saba  BES  would come into effect by 1 July 2007  On 12 October 2006  the Netherlands reached an agreement with Bonaire  Sint Eustatius  and Saba  this agreement would make these islands special municipalities   On 3 November 2006  Curaçao and Sint Maarten were granted autonomy in an agreement  but this agreement was rejected by the then island council of Curaçao on 28 November  The Curaçao government was not sufficiently convinced that the agreement would provide enough autonomy for Curaçao  On 9 July 2007 the new island council of Curaçao approved the agreement previously rejected in November 2006  A subsequent referendum approved the agreement as well   The acts of parliament integrating the  BES  islands  Bonaire  Sint Eustatius and Saba  into the Netherlands were given royal assent on 17 May 2010  After ratification by the Netherlands  6 July   the Netherlands Antilles  20 August   and Aruba  4 September   the Kingdom act amending the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands with regard to the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles was signed off by the three countries in the closing Round Table Conference on 9 September 2010 in The Hague   2  Constitution  The Constitution of the Netherlands Antilles was proclaimed on 29 March 1955 by Order in Council for the Kingdom  Together with the Island Regulation of the Netherlands Antilles it formed the constitutional basis for the Netherlands Antilles  The fact that the Constitution depended on the Island Regulation  and the fact that the Island Regulation gave fairly large autonomy to the different island territories  and the fact that the Island Regulation was older than the Constitution  has led many scholars to describe the Netherlands Antilles as a federal arrangement   The head of state was the ruling monarch of the Netherlands  who was represented in the Netherlands Antilles by a governor  The governor and the council of ministers  chaired by a prime minister  formed the government  The Netherlands Antilles had a unicameral legislature called the Estates of the Netherlands Antilles  Its 22 members were fixed in number for the islands making up the Netherlands Antilles  fourteen for Curaçao  three each for Sint Maarten and Bonaire  and one each for Saba and Sint Eustatius   The Netherlands Antilles were not part of the European Union  but instead listed as overseas countries and territories  OCTs   This status was kept for all the islands after dissolution  and will be kept until at least 2015   3  Island territories  The Island Regulation originally divided the Netherlands Antilles into four island territories  Aruba  Bonaire  Curaçao  ABC   and the Windward islands  In 1983  the island territory of the Windward islands was split up to form the new island territories of Sint Maarten  Saba  and Sint Eustatius  SSS   In 1986  Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles  reducing the number of island territories to five  After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010  Curaçao and Sint Maarten became autonomous countries within the Kingdom and Bonaire  Sint Eustatius and Saba  BES  became special municipalities of the Netherlands   4  Geography  The two island groups of which the Netherlands Antilles consisted were   the  Leeward Islands   Benedenwindse Eilanden or ABC islands   part of the Leeward Antilles island chain off the Venezuelan coast   Aruba  Bonaire  including an islet called Klein Bonaire   Little Bonaire    Curaçao  including an islet called Klein Curaçao   Little Curaçao    the  Windward Islands   Bovenwindse Eilanden or SSS islands  east of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands  These are part of what are in English called the Leeward Islands  but French  Spanish  Dutch and the English spoken locally these are considered part of the Windward Islands   Sint Maarten  the southern half of the island Saint Martin  the northern half  Saint Martin  is an overseas collectivity of France    Saba  Sint Eustatius The windward islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly  leaving little ground suitable for agriculture  The leeward islands have a mixed volcanic and coral origin  The highest point was Mount Scenery    on Saba  also the highest point in all the Kingdom of the Netherlands    4 1  Climate  The Netherlands Antilles had a tropical climate  with warm weather all year round  The windward islands are subject to hurricanes in the summer months  while the leeward Islands are warmer and drier   5  Economy  Tourism  petroleum transshipment and oil refinement  on Curaçao   as well as offshore finance were the mainstays of this small economy  which was closely tied to the outside world  The islands enjoyed a high per capita income and a well developed infrastructure as compared with other countries in the region   Almost all consumer and capital goods were imported  with Venezuela  the United States  and Mexico being the major suppliers  as well as the Dutch government which supports the islands with substantial development aid  Poor soils and inadequate water supplies hampered the development of agriculture  The Antillean guilder had a fixed exchange rate with the United States dollar of 1 79 1   6  Demographics  A large percentage of the Netherlands Antilleans descended from European colonists and African slaves who were brought and traded here from the 17th to 19th centuries  The rest of the population originated from other Caribbean islands as well as Latin America  East Asia and elsewhere in the world  In Curaçao there was a strong Jewish element going back to the 17th century   The language Papiamentu was predominant on Curaçao and Bonaire  as well as the neighboring island of Aruba   This creole descended from Portuguese and West African languages with a strong admixture of Dutch  plus subsequent lexical contributions from Spanish and English  An English based creole dialect  formally known as Netherlands Antilles Creole  was the native dialect of the inhabitants of Sint Eustatius  Saba and Sint Maarten   After a decades long debate  English and Papiamentu were made official languages alongside Dutch in early March 2007  Legislation was produced in Dutch but parliamentary debate was in Papiamentu or English  depending on the island  Due to a massive influx of immigrants from Spanish speaking territories such as the Dominican Republic in the Windward Islands  and increased tourism from Venezuela in the Leeward Islands  Spanish had also become increasingly used   The majority of the population were followers of the Christian faith  with a Protestant majority in Sint Eustatius and Sint Maarten  and a Roman Catholic majority in Bonaire  Curaçao and Saba  Curaçao also hosted a sizeable group of followers of the Jewish faith  descendants of a Portuguese group of Sephardic Jews that arrived from Amsterdam and Brazil from 1654   Most Netherlands Antilleans were Dutch citizens and this status permitted and encouraged the young and university educated to emigrate to the Netherlands  This exodus was considered to be to the islands  detriment  as it created a brain drain  On the other hand  immigrants from the Dominican Republic  Haiti  the Anglophone Caribbean and Colombia had increased their presence on these islands in later years   7  Culture  The origins of the population and location of the islands gave the Netherlands Antilles a mixed culture   Tourism and overwhelming media presence from the United States increased the regional United States influence  On all the islands  the holiday of Carnival had become an important event after its importation from other Caribbean and Latin American countries in the 1960s  Festivities included  jump up  parades with beautifully colored costumes  floats  and live bands as well as beauty contests and other competitions  Carnival on the islands also included a middle of the night j ouvert  juvé  parade that ended at sunrise with the burning of a straw King Momo  cleansing the island of sins and bad luck   8  Sports  Netherlands Lesser Antilles competed in the Winter Olympics of 1988  notably finishing 29th in the bobsled  ahead of Jamaica who famously competed but finished 30th   Baseball is by far the most popular sport  Several players have made it to the Major Leagues  such as Jair Bogaerts  Xander Bogaerts  Hensley Meulens  Randall Simon  Andruw Jones  Jair Jurrjens  Roger Bernadina  Sidney Ponson  Didi Gregorius  Shairon Martis  Wladimir Balentien  and Yurendell DeCaster  Xander Bogaerts competed in the 2013 World Series for the Boston Red Sox against the St  Louis Cardinals  Andruw Jones played for the Atlanta Braves in the 1996 World Series hitting two home runs in the first game against the New York Yankees   Three athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics  They  alongside one athlete from South Sudan  competed under the banner of Independent Olympic Athletes   9  Miscellaneous topics  Unlike the metropolitan Netherlands  same sex marriages were not performed in the Netherlands Antilles  but those performed in other jurisdictions were recognised   The main prison of the Netherlands Antilles was Koraal Specht  later known as Bon Futuro  It was known for ill treatment of prisoners and bad conditions throughout the years   The late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez claimed that the Netherlands was helping the United States to invade Venezuela due to military games in 2006  Curaçao is under consideration as a Cooperative Security Location  not a full Main Operating Base   10  See also  American West Indies  British West Indies  Danish West Indies  French West Indies  Spanish West Indies  Index of
