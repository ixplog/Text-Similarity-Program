A trade secret is an invented formula  practice  process  design  instrument  pattern  commercial method  or compilation of information which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by others  and by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers  In some international jurisdictions  such secrets are referred to as  confidential information   but are generally not referred to as  classified information  in the United States  since that refers to government secrets protected by a different set of laws and practices   1  Definition  The precise language by which a trade secret is defined varies by jurisdiction  as do the particular types of information that are subject to trade secret protection   However  there are three factors that  although subject to differing interpretations  are common to all such definitions  a trade secret is information that   Is not generally known to the public   Confers some sort of economic benefit on its holder  where this benefit must derive specifically from its not being publicly known  not just from the value of the information itself    Is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy  These three aspects are also incorporated in the TRIPS Agreement in Article 39   By comparison  under U S  law   A trade secret  as defined under  3   A    B   1996   has three parts   1  information   2  reasonable measures taken to protect the information  and  3  which derives independent economic value from not being publicly known    2  Protection  Trade secrets are by definition not disclosed to the world at large  Instead  owners of trade secrets seek to protect trade secret information from competitors by instituting special procedures for handling it  as well as technological and legal security measures  Legal protections include non disclosure agreements  NDA  and non compete clauses  In exchange for an opportunity to be employed by the holder of secrets  an employee may sign an agreement not to reveal his or her prospective employer s proprietary information  An employee may also surrender or assign to his employer the right to his own intellectual work produced during the course  or as a condition  of employment  Violation of the agreement generally carries the possibility of heavy financial penalties  These penalties operate as a disincentive to reveal trade secrets  However  proving a breach of an NDA against a former employee who is legally working for a competitor can be very difficult  A holder of a trade secret may also require similar agreements from other parties he deals with  such as vendors or licensees   A company can protect its confidential information through non compete and non disclosure contracts with its employees  within the constraints of employment law  including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic  and time scope   The law of protection of confidential information effectively allows a perpetual monopoly in secret information – it does not expire as would a patent  The lack of formal protection  however  means that a third party is not prevented from independently duplicating and using the secret information once it is discovered  Secret formulae are often protected by restricting the key information to a few trusted individuals  Famous examples of products protected by trade secrets are Chartreuse liqueur and Coca Cola   Protection of trade secret can  in principle  extend indefinitely and therefore may provide an advantage over patent protection  which lasts only for a specific period of time  Coca Cola  for example  has no patent for its formula and has been very effective in protecting it for many more years than the twenty years of protection that a patent would have provided  In fact  Coca Cola refused to reveal its trade secret under at least two judges  orders  The disadvantage is that there is no protection once information protected as trade secret is uncovered by others through reverse engineering  for example  whereas patent has a guaranteed time of protection in exchange for disclosing the information to the public   3  Misappropriation  Companies often try to discover one another s trade secrets through lawful methods of reverse engineering or employee poaching on one hand  and potentially unlawful methods including industrial espionage on the other  Acts of industrial espionage are generally illegal in their own right under the relevant governing laws  The importance of that illegality to trade secret law is as follows  If a trade secret is acquired by improper means  a somewhat wider concept than  illegal means  but inclusive of such means   the secret is generally deemed to have been misappropriated  Thus if a trade secret has been acquired via industrial espionage  its acquirer will probably be subject to legal liability for acquiring it improperly   The holder of the trade secret is nevertheless obliged to protect against such espionage to some degree in order to safeguard the secret  As noted above  under most trade secret regimes  a trade secret is not deemed to exist unless its purported holder takes reasonable steps to maintain its secrecy    4  History  4 1  Roman law  Commentators starting with A  Arthur Schiller assert that trades secrets were protected under Roman law by a claim known as   actio servi corrupti   interpreted as an  action for making a slave worse   or an action for corrupting a servant   The Roman law is described as follows    T he Roman owner of a mark or firm name was legally protected against unfair usage by a competitor through the actio servi corrupti     which the Roman jurists used to grant commercial relief under the guise of private law actions   If  as the writer believes  writes Schiller   various private cases of action were available in satisfying commercial needs  the state was acting in exactly the same fashion as it does at the present day   The suggestion that trade secret law has its roots in Roman law was introduced in 1929 in a Columbia Law Review article called  Trade Secrets and the Roman Law  The Actio Servi Corrupti   which has been reproduced in Schiller s  An American Experience in Roman Law 1  1971   See Trade Secrets and Roman Law  The Myth Exploded  at 19  However  the University of Georgia Law School professor Alan Watson argued in Trade Secrets and Roman Law  The Myth Exploded that the actio servi corrupti was not used to protect trade secrets p  19  Rather  he explained   Schiller is sadly mistaken as to what was going on      The actio servi corrupti presumably or possibly could be used to protect trade secrets and other similar commercial interests  That was not its purpose and was  at most  an incidental spin off  But there is not the slightest evidence that the action was ever so used  In this regard the actio servi corrupti is not unique  Exactly the same can be said of many private law actions including those for theft  damage to property  deposit  and production of property  All of these could  I suppose  be used to protect trade secrets  etc   but there is no evidence they were  It is bizarre to see any degree the Roman actio servi corrupti as the counterpart of modern law for the protection of trade secrets and other such commercial interests   4 2  19th century  Trade secret law as we know it today made its first appearance in England in 1817 in Newbery v James  and in the United States in 1837 in Vickery v  Welch  While those cases involved the first known common law causes of action based on a modern concept of trade secret laws  neither involved injunctive relief  rather  they involved damages only  In England  the first case involving injunctive relief came in 1820 in Yovatt v Winyard  while in the United States  it took until the 1866 case Taylor v  Blanchard   Trade secrets law continued to evolve throughout the United States as a hodgepodge of state laws  In 1939  the American Law Institute issued the Restatement of Torts  containing a summary of trade secret laws across states  which served as the primary resource until the latter part of the century  As of 2013  however  only four states—Massachusetts  New Jersey  New York  and Texas—still rely on the Restatement as their primary source of guidance  other than their body of state case law   It has also been recently theorized that the doctrine of trade secrets should protect competitively valuable  personal information of company executives  in a concept known as “executive trade secrets”   4 3  Current regulation  4 3 1  United States  Although trade secrets law evolved under state common law  prior to 1974  the question of whether patent law preempted state trade secrets law had been unanswered  In 1974  the United States Supreme Court issued the landmark decision  Kewanee Oil Co  v  Bicron Corp   which resolved the question in favor of allowing the states to freely develop their own trade secret laws   In 1979 several U S  states adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act  UTSA   which was further amended in 1985  with approximately 47 states having adopted it as the basis for trade secret law  Another significant development is the Economic Espionage Act of 1996     which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime  This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity  The first    criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers The second    criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes   The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses    4 3 2  Commonwealth jurisdictions  In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions  confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right  with the exception of Hong Kong where a judgment of the High Court indicates that confidential information may be a property right   The Court of Appeal of England and Wales in the case of Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v  Campbell Engineering Ltd held that the action for breach of confidence is based on a principle of preserving  good faith   See Breach of confidence in English law   The test for a cause of action for breach of confidence in the common law world is set out in the case of Coco v  A N  Clark  Engineers  Ltd   The information itself must have the necessary quality of confidence about it   That information must have been imparted in circumstances imparting an obligation of confidence   There must be an unauthorized use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it  The  quality of confidence  highlights that trade secrets are a legal concept  With sufficient effort or through illegal acts  such as break and enter   competitors can usually obtain trade secrets  However  so long as the owner of the trade secret can prove that reasonable efforts have been made to keep the information confidential  the information remains a trade secret and generally remains legally protected  Conversely  trade secret owners who cannot evidence reasonable efforts at protecting confidential information  risk losing the trade secret  even if the information is obtained by competitors illegally  It is for this reason that trade secret owners shred documents and do not simply recycle them   A successful plaintiff is entitled to various forms of judicial relief  including   An injunction  An account of profits or an award of damages  A declaration  5  Comparison to other types of intellectual property law  In the United States  trade secrets are not protected by law in the same manner as trademarks or patents  Specifically  both trademarks and patents are protected under federal statutes  the Lanham Act and Patent Act  respectively  Instead  trade secrets are protected under state laws  and most states have enacted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act  UTSA   except for Massachusetts  New York  and North Carolina  One of the differences between patents and trademarks  on the one hand  and trade secrets  on the other  is that trade secret is protected only when the secret is not disclosed   5 1  Comparison with trademarks  To acquire rights in a trademark under U S  law  one must simply use the mark  in commerce   It is possible to register a trademark in the United States  both at the federal and state levels   Registration of trademarks confers some advantages  including stronger protection in certain respects  but it is not required in order to get protection   Registration may be required in order to file a lawsuit for trademark infringement  Other nations have different trademark policies and this information may not apply to them  Assuming the mark in question meets certain other standards of protectibility  it is protected from infringement on the grounds that other uses might confuse consumers as to the origin or nature of the goods once the mark has been associated with a particular supplier   Similar considerations apply to service marks and trade dress   By definition  a trademark enjoys no protection  qua trademark  until and unless it is  disclosed  to consumers  for only then are consumers able to associate it with a supplier or source in the requisite manner   That a company plans to use a certain trademark might itself be protectible as a trade secret  however  until the mark is actually made public    5 2  Comparison with patents  To acquire a patent  full information about the method or product has to be supplied to the patent office and upon publication or issuance  will then be available to all  After expiration of the patent  competitors can copy the method or product legally  The temporary monopoly on the subject matter of the patent is regarded as a tradeoff for thus disclosing the information to the public   One popular misconception held by many is that trade secret protection is incompatible with patent protection  It is typically said that if you apply for a patent you can no longer maintain a trade secret on the invention  but this is an oversimplification  It is true that in order to obtain a patent you must disclose your invention so that others will be able to both make and use the invention  and  to obtain a patent in the United States  if you have any preferences you must likewise disclose your preferences  What is typically not appreciated though is that the critical time for satisfying this disclosure requirement is at the time the application is filed  In many if not most situations  improvements will be made to an invention even after filing of the patent application  and additional information will be learned  None of this additional information must be disclosed and can instead be kept as a secret  Virtually all patent licenses include clauses that require the inventor to disclose any trade secrets they have  Frequently it is this information not disclosed in the patent that is the most commercially viable  Thus  if you are attempting to sell or license your patent rights you want to make sure that you take steps to continue to maintain your trade secrets as secrets  otherwise they will be lost  Accordingly  before disclosing any secrets not already protected by an issued patent you should use a non disclosure agreement   Compared to patents  the advantages of trade secrets are that a trade secret is not limited in time  it  continues indefinitely as long as the secret is not revealed to the public   whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time  after which others may freely copy the invention   a trade secret does not imply any registration costs  has an immediate effect  does not require compliance with any formalities  and does not imply any disclosure of the invention to the public  The disadvantages of trade secrets include that  others may be able to legally discover the secret and be thereafter entitled to use it    others may obtain patent protection for legally discovered secrets   and a trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent   6  Criticism  When trade secret regulations are used to mask the composition of chemical agents used by consumers  they have come under criticism for allowing to hide the presence of potentially harmful and toxic ingredients  It has been argued that it is the public that is being denied a clearer picture about the safety of a product whereas competitors are well in a position to analyze its chemical composition  Thus in 2004  the National Environmental Trust tested forty common consumer products and found in more than half of them toxic substances not listed on the product label   7  Cases  Data General Corp  v  Digital Computer Controls  Inc   297
