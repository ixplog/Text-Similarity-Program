USS Indianapolis  CA 35  was a heavy cruiser of the United States Navy  She was named for the city of Indianapolis  Indiana   She was flagship for Admiral Raymond Spruance while he commanded the Fifth Fleet in battles across the Central Pacific  Her sinking led to the greatest single loss of life at sea in the history of the U S  Navy  On 30 July 1945  after delivering parts for the first atomic bomb to the United States air base at Tinian  the ship was torpedoed by the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine I 58  sinking in 12 minutes  Of 1 196 crewmen aboard  approximately 300 went down with the ship   The remaining 900 faced exposure  dehydration  saltwater poisoning  and shark attacks while floating with few lifeboats and almost no food or water  The Navy learned of the sinking when survivors were spotted four days later by the crew of a PV 1 Ventura on routine patrol  Only 317 survived   1  Commanders  Capt  John M  Smeallie  15 November 1932 – 10 December 1934   Capt  William S

 treaty cruisers  constructed by the United States Navy following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922  following the two vessels of the Pensacola class ordered in 1926 and the six of the Northampton class ordered in 1927  Ordered for the U S  Navy in fiscal year 1930  Indianapolis was originally a light cruiser  given the hull classification symbol CL 35  being re designated a heavy cruiser with the symbol CA 35 on 1 July 1931  in accordance with the London Naval Treaty   As built  the Portland cruisers were to be in length overall  and long at the waterline  abeam  and with a draft of   maximum   They were designed for a standard displacement of   and a full load displacement of   However  when completed she did not reach this weight  displacing   The ship had two distinctive raked funnels  a tripod foremast  and a small tower and pole mast aft  In 1943  light tripods were added forward of the second funnel on each ship  and a prominent Naval director was installed aft   The ship had four propeller shafts and four Parsons GT geared turbines and eight Yarrow boilers  The gave a design speed of She was designed for a range of at   She rolled badly until fitted with a bilge keel   The cruiser had nine Mark 9 8  55 caliber guns in three triple mounts  a superfiring pair fore and one aft  For anti aircraft defense  she had eight 5  25 caliber guns and two QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns  In 1945  she received 24 Bofors 40mm guns  arrayed in six quad mounts  Both ships were upgraded with twelve Oerlikon 20 mm cannons  No torpedo tubes were fitted on her   The Portland class was originally had armor for deck and side protection  but in construction they were given belt armor between  around the magazines  and in thick  Armor on the bulkheads was between and   that on the deck was   the barbettes   the gunhouses   and the conning tower    Portland class cruisers were to be outfitted as fleet flagships  with space for an admiral and his staff  The class also had an aircraft catapult amidships  They could carry four aircraft  The total crew varied  with a regular designed complement of 807  a wartime complement of 952  which could increase to 1 229 when the cruiser was a fleet flagship   Indianapolis was laid down by New York Shipbuilding Corporation on 31 March 1930  The hull and machinery were provided by the builder  Indianapolis was launched on 7 November 1931 and commissioned on 15 November 1932  She was the second ship named for Indianapolis  Indiana following the cargo ship of the same name in 1918  She was sponsored by Lucy Taggart  daughter of former Mayor of Indianapolis Thomas Taggart   3  Interwar period  Under her first captain  John M  Smeallie  Indianapolis undertook her shakedown cruise through the Atlantic and into Guantánamo Bay until 23 February 1932  Indianapolis then transited the Panama Canal Zone for training off the Chilean coast  After overhaul at Philadelphia Navy Yard  she sailed to Maine to embark President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at Campobello Island in New Brunswick on 1 July 1933  Getting underway the same day  Indianapolis arrived at Annapolis  Maryland on 3 July  She hosted six members of the Cabinet along with Roosevelt during its stay there  After disembarking Roosevelt  she departed Annapolis on 4 July  and steamed for Philadelphia Navy Yard   On 6 September  she embarked Secretary of the Navy Claude A  Swanson for an inspection of the Navy in the Pacific  Indianapolis toured the Canal Zone  Hawaii  and installations in San Pedro and San Diego  Swanson disembarked on 27 October  On 1 November 1933  she became flagship of Scouting Force 1  and maneuvered with the force off Long Beach  California  She departed on 9 April 1934 and arrived at New York City and embarked Roosevelt a second time  for a naval review  She returned to Long Beach on 9 November 1934 for more training with the Scouting Force  She remained flagship of Scouting Force 1 until 1941  On 18 November 1936  she embarked Roosevelt a third time at Charleston  South Carolina  and conducted a goodwill cruise to South America with him  She visited Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  Buenos Aires  Argentina  and Montevideo  Uruguay for state visits before returning to Charleston and disembarking Roosevelt s party on 15 December   4  World War II  On 7 December 1941  Indianapolis was conducting a mock bombardment at Johnston Atoll during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  Indianapolis was absorbed into Task Force 12 and searched for the Japanese carriers responsible for the attack  though the force did not locate them  She returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 December and joined Task Force 11   4 1  New Guinea campaign  With the task force  she steamed to the South Pacific  to south of Rabaul  New Britain  escorting the aircraft carrier   Late in the afternoon of 20 February 1942  the American ships were attacked by 18 Japanese aircraft  Of these  16 were shot down by aircraft from Lexington and the other two were destroyed by anti aircraft fire from the ships   On 10 March  the task force  reinforced by another force centered on the carrier   attacked Lae and Salamaua  New Guinea  where the Japanese were marshaling amphibious forces  Attacking from the south through the Owen Stanley mountain range  the U S  air forces surprised and inflicted heavy damage on Japanese warships and transports  losing few aircraft  Indianapolis returned to Mare Island shipyard for a refit before escorting a convoy to Australia   4 2  Aleutian Islands campaign  She then headed for the North Pacific to support American units in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands  On 7 August  Indianapolis and the task force attacked Kiska Island a Japanese staging area  Although fog hindered observation  Indianapolis and other ships fired their main guns into the bay  Floatplanes from the cruisers reported Japanese ships sunk in the harbor and damage to shore installations  After 15 minutes  Japanese shore batteries returned fire before being destroyed by the ships  main guns  Japanese submarines approaching the force were depth charged by American destroyers  Japanese seaplanes made an ineffective bombing attack  In spite of a lack of information on the Japanese forces  the operation was considered a success  U S  forces later occupied Adak Island  providing a naval base further from the Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island  In January 1943  Indianapolis  supporting a landing and occupation on Amchitka  part of an Allied island hopping strategy in the Aleutian Islands   On the evening of 19 February  Indianapolis led two destroyers on a patrol southwest of Attu Island  searching for Japanese ships trying to reinforce Kiska and Attu  She intercepted a Japanese cargo ship  Akagane Maru  The cargo ship tried to reply to the radio challenge but was shelled by Indianapolis  Akagane Maru exploded and sank with all hands  Through mid 1943  Indianapolis remained near the Aleutian Islands escorting American convoys and providing shore bombardments supporting amphibious assaults  In May  the Allies captured Attu  then turned on Kiska  thought to be the final Japanese holdout in the Aleutians  Allied landings there began on 15 August but the Japanese had already abandoned the Aleutian Islands  unbeknownst to the Allies   4 3  1943 operations  After refitting at Mare Island  Indianapolis moved to Hawaii as flagship of Vice Admiral Raymond A  Spruance  commanding the 5th Fleet  She sortied from Pearl Harbor on 10 November with the main body of the Southern Attack Force for Operation Galvanic  the invasion of the Gilbert Islands  On 19 November  Indianapolis bombarded Tarawa Atoll and next day pounded Makin  see Battle of Makin   The ship then returned to Tarawa as fire support for the landings  Her guns shot down an enemy plane and shelled enemy strongpoints as landing parties fought Japanese defenders in the bloody and costly battle of Tarawa  She continued this role until the leveled island was secure three days later  The conquest of the Marshall Islands followed victory in the Gilberts  Indianapolis was again 5th Fleet flagship   4 4  1944  The cruiser met other ships of her task force at Tarawa  and on D Day minus 1  31 January 1944  she was one of the cruisers which bombarded the islands of Kwajalein Atoll  The shelling continued on D Day with Indianapolis silencing two enemy shore batteries  Next day she obliterated a blockhouse and other shore installations and supported advancing troops with a creeping barrage  The ship entered Kwajalein Lagoon on 4 February  and remained until resistance disappeared   See Battle of Kwajalein    In March and April  Indianapolis  still flagship of the 5th Fleet  attacked the Western Carolines  Carrier planes at the Palau Islands on 30–31 March sank three destroyers  17 freighters  five oilers and damaged 17 other ships  Airfields were bombed and surrounding water mined  Yap and Ulithi were struck on the 31st and Woleai on 1 April  Japanese planes attacked but were driven off without damaging the American ships  Indianapolis shot down her second plane  a torpedo bomber  and the Japanese lost 160 planes  including 46 on the ground  These attacks prevented Japanese forces from the Carolines from interfering with the U S  landings on New Guinea   In June  the 5th Fleet was busy with the assault on the Mariana Islands  Raids on Saipan began with carrier based planes on 11 June  followed by surface bombardment  in which Indianapolis had a major role  from 13 June   See Battle of Saipan   On D Day  15 June  Admiral Spruance heard that battleships  carriers  cruisers  and destroyers were headed south to relieve threatened garrisons in the Marianas  Since amphibious operations at Saipan had to be protected  Admiral Spruance could not withdraw too far  Consequently  a fast carrier force was sent to meet this threat while another force attacked Japanese air bases on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima in the Bonin and Volcano Islands  bases for potential enemy air attacks   A combined U S  fleet fought the Japanese on 19 June in the Battle of the Philippine Sea  Japanese carrier planes  which hoped to use the airfields of Guam and Tinian to refuel and rearm  were met by carrier planes and the guns of the Allied escorting ships  That day  the U S  Navy destroyed a reported 426 Japanese planes while losing 29  Indianapolis shot down one torpedo plane  This day of aerial combat became known as the  Marianas Turkey Shoot   With Japanese air opposition wiped out  the U S  carrier planes sank   two destroyers  and one tanker and damaged others  Two other carriers  and   were sunk by submarines   Indianapolis returned to Saipan on 23 June to resume fire support and six days later moved to Tinian to attack shore installations  see Battle of Tinian   Meanwhile  Guam had been taken  and Indianapolis was the first ship to enter Apra Harbor since early in the war  The ship operated in the Marianas for the next few weeks  then moved to the Western Carolines where further landings were planned  From 12 to 29 September  she bombarded the Peleliu in the Palau Group  before and after the landings  see Battle of Peleliu   She then sailed to Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands where she operated for 10 days before returning to the Mare Island Navy Yard   4 5  1945  Overhauled  Indianapolis joined Vice Admiral Marc A  Mitscher s fast carrier task force on 14 February 1945  Two days later  the task force launched an attack on Tokyo to cover the landings on Iwo Jima  scheduled for 19 February  This was the first carrier attack on Japan since the Doolittle Raid  The mission was to destroy Japanese air facilities and other installations in the  Home Islands   The fleet achieved complete tactical surprise by approaching the Japanese coast under cover of bad weather  The attacks were pressed home for two days  The American Navy lost 49 carrier planes while claiming 499 enemy planes  a 10 1 kill loss ratio  The task force also sank a carrier  nine coastal ships  a destroyer  two destroyer escorts  and a cargo ship  They destroyed hangars  shops  aircraft installations  factories  and other industrial targets   Immediately after the strikes  the task force raced to Bonin to support the landings on Iwo Jima  The ship remained there until 1 March  protecting the invasion ships and bombarding targets in support of the landings  Indianapolis returned to Admiral Mitscher s task force in time to strike Tokyo again on 25 February and Hachijō off the southern coast of Honshū the following day  Although weather was extremely bad  the American force destroyed 158 planes and sank five small ships while pounding ground installations and destroying trains   The next target for the U S  forces was Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands  which were in range of aircraft from the Japanese mainland  The fast carrier force was tasked with attacking airfields in southern Japan until they were incapable of launching effective airborne opposition to the impending invasion  The fast carrier force departed for Japan from Ulithi on 14 March  On 18 March  it launched an attack from a position southeast of the island of Kyūshū  The attack targeted airfields on Kyūshū as well as ships of the Japanese fleet in the harbors of Kobe and Kure on southern Honshū  The Japanese located the American task force on 21 March  sending 48 planes to attack the ships  Twenty four fighters from the task force intercepted and shot down all the Japanese aircraft   Pre invasion bombardment of Okinawa began on 24 March  Indianapolis spent 7 days pouring shells into the beach defenses  During this time  enemy aircraft repeatedly attacked the American ships  Indianapolis shot down six planes and damaged two others  On 31 March  the ship s lookouts spotted a Japanese fighter as it emerged from the morning twilight and roared at the bridge in a vertical dive  The ship s 20 mm guns opened fire  but within 15 seconds  the plane was over the ship  Tracers converged on it  causing it to swerve  but the enemy pilot managed to release his bomb from a height of   crashing his plane into the sea near the port stern  The bomb plummeted through the deck  into the crew s mess hall  down through the berthing compartment  and through the fuel tanks before crashing through the keel and exploding in the water underneath  The concussion blew two gaping holes in the keel which flooded nearby compartments  killing nine crewmen  The ship s bulkheads prevented any progressive flooding  The Indianapolis  settling slightly by the stern and listing to port  steamed to a salvage ship for emergency repairs  Here  inspection revealed that her propeller shafts were damaged  her fuel tanks ruptured  and her water distilling equipment ruined  But the Indianapolis commenced the long trip across the Pacific to Mare Island under her own power   4 5 1  Loss  After major repairs and an overhaul  Indianapolis received orders to proceed to Tinian island  carrying parts and the enriched uranium  about half of the world s supply of Uranium 235 at the time  for the atomic bomb Little Boy  which would later be dropped on Hiroshima  Indianapolis departed San Francisco on 16 July 1945  Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 19 July  she raced on unaccompanied  delivering the atomic weapon components to Tinian on 26 July  Indianapolis was then sent to Guam where a number of the crew who had completed their tours of duty were replaced by other sailors  Leaving Guam on 28 July  she began sailing toward Leyte where her crew was to receive training before continuing on to Okinawa to join Vice Admiral Jesse B  Oldendorf s Task Force 95  At 00 14 on 30 July  she was struck on her starboard bow by two Type 95 torpedoes from the Japanese submarine   under the command of Mochitsura Hashimoto  The explosions caused massive damage  The Indianapolis took on a heavy list  and settled by the bow  Twelve minutes later  she rolled completely over  then her stern rose into the air  and she plunged down  Some 300 of the 1 196 crewmen went down with the ship  With few lifeboats and many without lifejackets  the remainder of the crew were set adrift   Navy command had no knowledge of the ship s sinking until survivors were spotted three and a half days later  At 10 25 on 2 August a PV 1 Ventura flown by Lieutenant Wilbur  Chuck  Gwinn and copilot Lieutenant Warren Colwell spotted the men adrift while on a routine patrol flight  Of the 880 who survived the sinking  only 321 men came out of the water alive  317 ultimately survived  They suffered from lack of food and water  some found rations such as Spam and crackers amongst the debris   exposure to the elements  hypothermia  dehydration  hypernatremia  photophobia  starvation and dementia   severe desquamation  and shark attacks  while some killed themselves or other survivors in various states of delirium and hallucinations  The Discovery Channel stated in Shark Week episodes  Ocean of Fear  that the Indianapolis sinking resulted in the most shark attacks on humans in history  and attributes the attacks to the oceanic whitetip shark species  Tiger sharks might have also killed some sailors  The same show attributed most of the deaths on Indianapolis to exposure  salt poisoning and thirst  with the dead being dragged off by sharks   Gwinn immediately dropped a life raft and a radio transmitter  All air and surface units capable of rescue operations were dispatched to the scene at once  A PBY Catalina seaplane under the command of Lieutenant R  Adrian Marks was dispatched to lend assistance and report  En route to the scene  Marks overflew and alerted her captain  future U S  Secretary of the Navy W  Graham Claytor  Jr   of the emergency  On his own authority  Claytor decided to divert to the scene   Arriving hours ahead of Doyle  Marks  crew began dropping rubber rafts and supplies  Having seen men being attacked by sharks  Marks disobeyed standing orders and landed on the open sea  He began taxiing to pick up the stragglers and lone swimmers who were at the greatest risk of shark attack  Learning the men were the crew of Indianapolis  he radioed the news  requesting immediate assistance  Doyle responded while en route  When Marks  plane was full  survivors were tied to the wings with parachute cord  damaging the wings so that the plane would never fly again and had to be sunk  Marks and his crew rescued 56 men that day   The Doyle was the first vessel on the scene  Homing on Marks s Catalina in total darkness  Doyle halted to avoid killing or further injuring survivors  and began taking Marks  survivors aboard  Disregarding the safety of his own vessel  Captain Claytor pointed his largest searchlight into the night sky to serve as a beacon for other rescue vessels  This beacon was the first indication to most survivors that rescuers had arrived   The destroyers     and were ordered to the rescue scene from Ulithi  along with destroyer escorts     and of the Philippine Sea Frontier  They continued their search for survivors until 8 August   Two of the rescued survivors  and   died in August 1945   4 6  Navy failure to learn of the sinking  Operations plotting boards were kept at the Headquarters of Commander Marianas on Guam and of the Commander Philippine Sea Frontier on Leyte  On these boards  the positions of all vessels of which the headquarters was concerned were plotted  However  for ships as large as the Indianapolis  it was assumed that they would reach their destinations on time  unless reported otherwise  Therefore  their positions were based on predictions  and not on reports  On 31 July  when she should have arrived at Leyte  Indianapolis was removed from the board in the headquarters of Commander Marianas  She was also recorded as having arrived at Leyte by the headquarters of Commander Philippine Sea Frontier  Lieutenant Stuart B  Gibson  the Operations Officer under the Port Director  Tacloban  was the officer responsible for tracking the movements of Indianapolis  The vessel s failure to arrive on schedule was known at once to Lieutenant Gibson  who failed to investigate the matter and made no immediate report of the fact to his superiors   The Indianapolis sent distress calls before sinking  Three stations received the signals  however  none acted upon the call  One commander was drunk  another had ordered his men not to disturb him and a third thought it was a Japanese trap  For a long time the Navy denied that a distress call had been sent  The receipt of the call came to light only after the release of declassified records   Immediately prior to the attack  the seas had been moderate  the visibility fluctuating but poor in general  and Indianapolis had been steaming at   When the ship did not reach Leyte on the 31st  as scheduled  no report was made that she was overdue  This omission was due to a misunderstanding of the Movement Report System   4 7  Captain Charles McVay  Captain Charles B  McVay III  who had commanded Indianapolis since November 1944  survived the sinking and was with those rescued days later  In November 1945  he was court martialed and convicted of  hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag   Several things about the court martial were controversial  There was evidence that the Navy itself had placed the ship in harm s way  in that McVay s orders were to  zigzag at his discretion  weather permitting   Further  Mochitsura Hashimoto  commander of I 58  testified that zigzagging would have made no difference   Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz remitted McVay s sentence and restored him to active duty  McVay retired in 1949 as a Rear Admiral  While many of Indianapolis survivors said McVay was not to blame for the sinking  the families of some of the men who died thought otherwise –  Merry Christmas  Our family s holiday would be a lot merrier if you hadn t killed my son   read one piece of mail  The guilt that was placed on his shoulders mounted until he committed suicide in 1968  using his Navy issue revolver  McVay was discovered on his front lawn with a toy sailor in one hand  He was 70 years old  The day the Indianapolis was sunk was his 47th birthday   In October 2000  the United States Congress passed a resolution that Captain McVay s record should state that  he is exonerated for the loss of Indianapolis   President Bill Clinton signed the resolution  The resolution noted that although several hundred ships of the U S  Navy were lost in combat in World War II  McVay was the only captain to be court martialed for the sinking of his ship  In July 2001  the Secretary of the Navy ordered McVay s record cleared of all wrongdoing   5  Awards  American Defense Service Medal  Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal with ten battle stars  World War II Victory Medal  6  The wreck  The exact location of Indianapolis is in the Philippine Sea – the coordinates given in this article are for the general area  In July–August 2001  an expedition sought to find the wreckage through the use of side scan sonar and underwater cameras mounted on a remotely operated vehicle  Four Indianapolis survivors accompanied the expedition  which was not successful  In June 2005  a second expedition was mounted to find the wreck  National Geographic covered the story and released it in July  Submersibles were launched to find any sign of wreckage  The only objects ever found  which have not been confirmed to have belonged to Indianapolis  were numerous pieces of metal of varying size found in the area of the reported sinking position  this was included in the National Geographic program Finding of the USS Indianapolis    7  Memorials  The USS Indianapolis Museum had its grand opening on 7 July 2007  with its gallery in the Indiana War Memorial Museum at the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza   The was dedicated on 2 August 1995  It is located on the Canal Walk in Indianapolis  The heavy cruiser is depicted in limestone and granite and sits adjacent to the downtown canal  The crewmembers  names are listed on the monument  with special notations for those who lost their lives   In May 2011  I 465 around Indianapolis was renamed the USS Indianapolis Memorial Highway   Some material relating to Indianapolis is held by the Indiana State Museum  Her bell and a commissioning pennant are located at the Heslar Naval Armory  the bell was removed to conserve weight prior to her final cruise   The swim training center at United States Navy Recruit Training Command is named USS Indianapolis   8  Popular culture  References to the Indianapolis sinking and aftermath have been adapted to film  stage  television  and popular culture  The incident itself was the subject of 1991 made for television movie Mission of the Shark  The Saga of the USS Indianapolis  with Stacy Keach portraying Captain Charles Butler McVay III   Arguably the most well known fictional reference to the events occurs in the 1975 thriller film Jaws in a monologue by actor Robert Shaw  whose character Quint is depicted as a survivor of the Indianapolis sinking  The monologue particularly focuses on the numerous deaths caused by shark attacks after the sinking  John Milius was specifically brought into the production to write lines for this scene and he based them on survivor stories  However  there are several historical inaccuracies in the monologue  the speech states the date of the sinking as 29 June 1945  when the ship was actually sunk on 30 July  and that no distress call was broadcast  while declassified Navy documents prove the contrary   9  See also  List of U S  Navy losses in
