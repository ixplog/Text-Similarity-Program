Natural law  or the law of nature     is a system of law that is determined by nature  and so is universal  Classically  natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze human nature — both social and personal — and deduce binding rules of moral behavior from it  Natural law is often contrasted with the positive law of a given political community  society  or state  In legal theory  on the other hand  the interpretation of positive law requires some reference to natural law  On this understanding of natural law  natural law can be invoked to criticize judicial decisions about what the law says but not to criticize the best interpretation of the law itself  Some scholars use natural law synonymously with natural justice or natural right  Latin ius naturale   while others distinguish between natural law and natural right   Although natural law is often conflated with common law  the two are distinct in that natural law is a view that certain rights or values are inherent in or universally cognizable by virtue of human reason or human nature  while common law is the legal tradition whereby certain rights or values are legally cognizable by virtue of judicial recognition or articulation  Natural law theories have  however  exercised a profound influence on the development of English common law  and have featured greatly in the philosophies of Thomas Aquinas  Francisco Suárez  Richard Hooker  Thomas Hobbes  Hugo Grotius  Samuel von Pufendorf  John Locke  Francis Hutcheson  Jean Jacques Burlamaqui  and Emmerich de Vattel  Because of the intersection between natural law and natural rights  it has been cited as a component in the United States Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States  as well as in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen  Declarationism states that the founding of the United States is based on Natural law   Natural Law and consent of the governed  John Locke  are the Foundation of the American Declaration of Independence  Constitution and Bill of Rights   See  Laws of Nature  First Paragraph Declaration of Independence  Consent of the Governed  derived from the John Locke s Natural Law Social Contract  replaced the Old World Governance Doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings  Thomas Hobbes    1  History  The use of natural law  in its various incarnations  has varied widely through its history  There are a number of different theories of natural law  differing from each other with respect to the role that morality plays in determining the authority of legal norms  This article deals with its usages separately rather than attempt to unify them into a single theory   1 1  Plato  Although Plato does not have an explicit theory of natural law  he rarely used the phrase  natural law  except in Gorgias 484 and Timaeus 83e   his concept of nature  according to John Wild  contains some of the elements found in many natural law theories  According to Plato we live in an orderly universe  At the basis of this orderly universe or nature are the forms  most fundamentally the Form of the Good  which Plato describes as  the brightest region of Being   The Form of the Good is the cause of all things and when it is seen it leads a person to act wisely  In the Symposium  the Good is closely identified with the Beautiful  Also in the Symposium  Plato describes how the experience of the Beautiful by Socrates enables him to resist the temptations of wealth and sex  In the Republic  the ideal community is      a city which would be established in accordance with nature    1 2  Aristotle  Greek philosophy emphasized the distinction between  nature   physis  φúσις  on the one hand and  law    custom   or  convention   nomos  νóμος  on the other  What the law commanded varied from place to place  but what was  by nature  should be the same everywhere  A  law of nature  would therefore have had the flavor more of a paradox than something that obviously existed  Against the conventionalism that the distinction between nature and custom could engender  Socrates and his philosophic heirs  Plato and Aristotle  posited the existence of natural justice or natural right  dikaion physikon  δικαιον φυσικον  Latin ius naturale   Of these  Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law   Aristotle s association with natural law may be due to the interpretation given to his works by Thomas Aquinas  But whether Aquinas correctly read Aristotle is a disputed question  According to some  Aquinas conflates the natural law and natural right  the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the Nicomachean Ethics  Book IV of the Eudemian Ethics   According to this interpretation  Aquinas s influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages in an unfortunate manner  though more recent translations render them more literally  Aristotle notes that natural justice is a species of political justice  viz  the scheme of distributive and corrective justice that would be established under the best political community  were this to take the form of law  this could be called a natural law  though Aristotle does not discuss this and suggests in the Politics that the best regime may not rule by law at all   The best evidence of Aristotle s having thought there was a natural law comes from the Rhetoric  where Aristotle notes that  aside from the  particular  laws that each people has set up for itself  there is a  common  law that is according to nature  Specifically  he quotes Sophocles and Empedocles   Universal law is the law of Nature  For there really is  as every one to some extent divines  a natural justice and injustice that is binding on all men  even on those who have no association or covenant with each other  It is this that Sophocles  Antigone clearly means when she says that the burial of Polyneices was a just act in spite of the prohibition  she means that it was just by nature  And so Empedocles  when he bids us kill no living creature  says that doing this is not just for some people while unjust for others   Some critics believe that the context of this remark suggests only that Aristotle advised that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law  especially when the  particular  law of one s own city was averse to the case being made  not that there actually was such a law  Moreover  they claim that Aristotle considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid  natural law provided in this passage to be wrong  Aristotle s theoretical paternity of the natural law tradition is consequently disputed   1 3  Stoic natural law  The development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the Stoics  The rise of natural law as a universal system coincided with the rise of large empires and kingdoms in the Greek world  Whereas the  higher  law Aristotle suggested one could appeal to was emphatically natural  in contradistinction to being the result of divine positive legislation  the Stoic natural law was indifferent to the divine or natural source of the law  the Stoics asserted the existence of a rational and purposeful order to the universe  a divine or eternal law   and the means by which a rational being lived in accordance with this order was the natural law  which spelled out action that accorded with virtue   As the English historian A  J  Carlyle  1861–1943  notes   There is no change in political theory so startling in its completeness as the change from the theory of Aristotle to the later philosophical view represented by Cicero and Seneca     We think that this cannot be better exemplified than with regard to the theory of the equality of human nature   Charles H  McIlwain likewise observes that  the idea of the equality of men is the profoundest contribution of the Stoics to political thought  and that  its greatest influence is in the changed conception of law that in part resulted from it  Natural law first appeared among the stoics who believed that God is everywhere and in everyone  Within humans is a  divine spark  which helps them to live in accordance with nature  The stoics felt that there was a way in which the universe had been designed and natural law helped us to harmonise with this   1 4  Cicero  Cicero wrote in his De Legibus that both justice and law derive their origin from what nature has given to man  from what the human mind embraces  from the function of man  and from what serves to unite humanity  For Cicero  natural law obliges us to contribute to the general good of the larger society  The purpose of positive laws is to provide for  the safety of citizens  the preservation of states  and the tranquility and happiness of human life   In this view   wicked and unjust statutes  are  anything but  laws    because  in the very definition of the term  law  there inheres the idea and principle of choosing what is just and true   Law  for Cicero   ought to be a reformer of vice and an incentive to virtue   Cicero expressed the view that  the virtues which we ought to cultivate  always tend to our own happiness  and that the best means of promoting them consists in living with men in that perfect union and charity which are cemented by mutual benefits    Cicero influenced the discussion of natural law for many centuries to come  up through the era of the American Revolution  The jurisprudence of the Roman Empire was rooted in Cicero  who held  an extraordinary grip     upon the imagination of posterity  as  the medium for the propagation of those ideas which informed the law and institutions of the empire   Cicero s conception of natural law  found its way to later centuries notably through the writings of Saint Isidore of Seville and the Decretum of Gratian   Thomas Aquinas  in his summary of medieval natural law  quoted Cicero s statement that  nature  and  custom  were the sources of a society s laws   The Renaissance Florentine chancellor Leonardo Bruni praised Cicero as the man  who carried philosophy from Greece to Italy  and nourished it with the golden river of his eloquence   The legal culture of Elizabethan England  exemplified by Sir Edward Coke  was  steeped in Ciceronian rhetoric   The Scottish moral philosopher Francis Hutcheson  as a student at Glasgow   was attracted most by Cicero  for whom he always professed the greatest admiration   More generally in eighteenth century Great Britain  Cicero s name was a household word among educated people  Likewise   in the admiration of early Americans Cicero took pride of place as orator  political theorist  stylist  and moralist    The British polemicist Thomas Gordon  incorporated Cicero into the radical ideological tradition that travelled from the mother country to the colonies in the course of the eighteenth century and decisively shaped early American political culture   Cicero s description of the immutable  eternal  and universal natural law was quoted by Burlamaqui and later by the American revolutionary legal scholar James Wilson  Cicero became John Adams s  foremost model of public service  republican virtue  and forensic eloquence   Adams wrote of Cicero that  as all the ages of the world have not produced a greater statesman and philosopher united in the same character  his authority should have great weight   Thomas Jefferson  first encountered Cicero as a schoolboy learning Latin  and continued to read his letters and discourses as long as he lived  He admired him as a patriot  valued his opinions as a moral philosopher  and there is little doubt that he looked upon Cicero s life  with his love of study and aristocratic country life  as a model for his own   Jefferson described Cicero as  the father of eloquence and philosophy    Some early Church Fathers  especially those in the West  sought to incorporate natural law into Christianity  The most notable among these was Augustine of Hippo  who equated natural law with man s prelapsarian state  as such  a life according to nature was no longer possible and men needed instead to seek salvation through the divine law and grace of Jesus Christ   In the twelfth century  Gratian equated the natural law with divine law  A century later  St  Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologica I II qq  90–106  restored Natural Law to its independent state  asserting natural law as the rational creature s participation in the eternal law  Yet  since human reason could not fully comprehend the Eternal law  it needed to be supplemented by revealed Divine law   See also Biblical law in Christianity   Meanwhile  Aquinas taught that all human or positive laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law  An unjust law is not a law  in the full sense of the word  It retains merely the  appearance  of law insofar as it is duly constituted and enforced in the same way a just law is  but is itself a  perversion of law   At this point  the natural law was not only used to pass judgment on the moral worth of various laws  but also to determine what the law said in the first place  This principle laid the seed for possible societal tension with reference to tyrants   The natural law was inherently teleological and deontological in that although it is aimed at goodness  it is entirely focused on the ethicalness of actions  rather than the consequence  The specific content of the natural law was therefore determined by a conception of what things constituted happiness  be they temporal satisfaction or salvation  The state  in being bound by the natural law  was conceived as an institution directed at bringing its subjects to true happiness   In the 16th century  the School of Salamanca  Francisco Suárez  Francisco de Vitoria  etc   further developed a philosophy of natural law  After the Church of England broke from Rome  the English theologian Richard Hooker adapted Thomistic notions of natural law to Anglicanism  There are five important principles  to live  to learn  to reproduce  to worship God  and to live in an ordered society   Those who see biblical support for the doctrine of natural law often point to Paul s Epistle to the Romans   For when the Gentiles  which have not the law  do by nature the things contained in the law  these  having not the law  are a law unto themselves  Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts  their conscience also bearing witness  and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another      The intellectual historian A  J  Carlyle has commented on this passage   There can be little doubt that St Paul s words imply some conception analogous to the  natural law  in Cicero  a law written in men s hearts  recognized by man s reason  a law distinct from the positive law of any State  or from what St Paul recognized as the revealed law of God  It is in this sense that St Paul s words are taken by the Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries like St Hilary of Poitiers  St Ambrose  and St Augustine  and there seems no reason to doubt the correctness of their interpretation    1 5  English jurisprudence  Heinrich A  Rommen remarked upon  the tenacity with which the spirit of the English common law retained the conceptions of natural law and equity which it had assimilated during the Catholic Middle Ages  thanks especially to the influence of Henry de Bracton  d  1268  and Sir John Fortescue  d  cir  1476    Bracton s translator notes that Bracton  was a trained jurist with the principles and distinctions of Roman jurisprudence firmly in mind   but Bracton adapted such principles to English purposes rather than copying slavishly  In particular  Bracton turned the imperial Roman maxim that  the will of the prince is law  on its head  insisting that the king is under the law  The legal historian Charles F  Mullett has noted Bracton s  ethical definition of law  his recognition of justice  and finally his devotion to natural rights   Bracton considered justice to be the  fountain head  from which  all rights arise   For his definition of justice  Bracton quoted the twelfth century Italian jurist Azo    Justice is the constant and unfailing will to give to each his right    Bracton s work was the second legal treatise studied by the young apprentice lawyer Thomas Jefferson   Fortescue stressed  the supreme importance of the law of God and of nature  in works that  profoundly influenced the course of legal development in the following centuries   The legal scholar Ellis Sandoz has noted that  the historically ancient and the ontologically higher law—eternal  divine  natural—are woven together to compose a single harmonious texture in Fortescue s account of English law   As the legal historian Norman Doe explains   Fortescue follows the general pattern set by Aquinas  The objective of every legislator is to dispose people to virtue  It is by means of law that this is accomplished  Fortescue s definition of law  also found in Accursius and Bracton   after all  was  a sacred sanction commanding what is virtuous  honesta  and forbidding the contrary    Fortescue cited Leonardo Bruni for his statement that  virtue alone produces happiness    Christopher St  Germain s Doctor and Student was a classic of English jurisprudence  and it was thoroughly annotated by Thomas Jefferson  St  Germain informs his readers that English lawyers generally don t use the phrase  law of nature   but rather use  reason  as the preferred synonym  Norman Doe notes that St  Germain s view  is essentially Thomist   quoting Thomas Aquinas s definition of law as  an ordinance of reason made for the common good by him who has charge of the community  and promulgated    Sir Edward Coke was the preeminent jurist of his time  Coke s preeminence extended across the ocean   For the American revolutionary leaders   law  meant Sir Edward Coke s custom and right reason   Coke defined law as  perfect reason  which commands those things that are proper and necessary and which prohibits contrary things   For Coke  human nature determined the purpose of law  and law was superior to any one man s reason or will  Coke s discussion of natural law appears in his report of Calvin s Case  1608    The law of nature is that which God at the time of creation of the nature of man infused into his heart  for his preservation and direction   In this case the judges found that  the ligeance or faith of the subject is due unto the King by the law of nature  secondly  that the law of nature is part of the law of England  thirdly  that the law of nature was before any judicial or municipal law  fourthly  that the law of nature is immutable   To support these findings  the assembled judges  as reported by Coke  who was one of them  cited as authorities Aristotle  Cicero  and the Apostle Paul  as well as Bracton  Fortescue  and St  Germain   As early as the thirteenth century  it was held that  the law of nature   is the ground of all laws  and by the Chancellor and Judges that  it is required by the law of nature that every person  before he can be punish d  ought to be present  and if absent by contumacy  he ought to be summoned and make default    Further  in 1824  we find it held that  proceedings in our Courts are founded upon the law of England  and that law is again founded upon the law of nature and the revealed law of God  If the right sought to be enforced is inconsistent with either of these  the English municipal courts cannot recognize it    1 6  American jurisprudence  The U S  Declaration of Independence states that it has become necessary for the people of the United States to assume  the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature s God entitle them   Some early American lawyers and judges perceived natural law as too tenuous  amorphous and evanescent a legal basis for grounding concrete rights and governmental limitations  Natural law did  however  serve as authority for legal claims and rights in some judicial decisions  legislative acts  and legal pronouncements  Robert Lowry Clinton argues that the U S  Constitution rests on a common law foundation and the common law  in turn  rests on a classical natural law foundation   1 7  Islamic natural law  Abū Rayhān al Bīrūnī  an Islamic scholar and polymath scientist  understood natural law as the survival of the fittest  He argued that the antagonism between human beings can only be overcome through a divine law  which he believed to have been sent through prophets  This is also the position of the Ashari school  the largest school of Sunni theology  Averroes  Ibn Rushd   in his treatise on Justice and Jihad and his commentary on Plato s Republic  writes that the human mind can know of the unlawfulness of killing and stealing and thus of the five maqasid or higher intents of the Islamic sharia or to protect religion  life  property  offspring  and reason  The concept of natural law entered the mainstream of Western culture through his Aristotelian commentaries  influencing the subsequent Averroist movement and the writings of Thomas Aquinas   The Maturidi school  the second largest school of Sunni theology  posits the existence of a form of natural law  Abu Mansur al Maturidi stated that the human mind could know of the existence of God and the major forms of  good  and  evil  without the help of revelation  Al Maturidi gives the example of stealing  which is known to be evil by reason alone due to man s working hard for his property  Killing  fornication  and drinking alcohol were all  evils  the human mind could know of according to al Maturidi  The concept of Istislah in Islamic law bears some similarities to the natural law tradition in the West  as exemplified by Thomas Aquinas  However  whereas natural law deems good what is self evidently good  according as it tends towards the fulfilment of the person  istislah calls good whatever is connected to one of five  basic goods   Al Ghazali abstracted these  basic goods  from the legal precepts in the Qur an and Sunnah  they are religion  life  reason  lineage and property  Some add also  honour   Ibn Qayyim Al Jawziyya also posited that human reason could discern between  great sins  and good deeds   1 8  Hobbes  By the 17th Century  the Medieval teleological view came under intense criticism from some quarters  Thomas Hobbes instead founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon  what they sought  happiness  was subject to contention  but a broad consensus could form around what they feared  violent death at the hands of another   The natural law was how a rational human being  seeking to survive and prosper  would act  Natural law  therefore  was discovered by considering humankind s natural rights  whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law  In Hobbes  opinion  the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign  Because the ultimate source of law now comes from the sovereign  and the sovereign s decisions need not be grounded in morality  legal positivism is born  Jeremy Bentham s modifications on legal positivism further developed the theory   As used by Thomas Hobbes in his treatises Leviathan and De Cive  natural law is  a precept  or general rule  found out by reason  by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life  or takes away the means of preserving the same  and to omit that by which he thinks it may best be preserved    According to Hobbes  there are nineteen Laws  The first two are expounded in chapter XIV of Leviathan   of the first and second natural laws  and of contracts    the others in chapter XV   of other laws of nature     The first Law of nature is that every man ought to endeavour peace  as far as he has hope of obtaining it  and when he cannot obtain it  that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war   The second Law of nature is that a man be willing  when others are so too  as far forth  as for peace  and defence of himself he shall think it necessary  to lay down this right to all things  and be contented with so much liberty against other men  as he would allow other men against himself   The third Law is that men perform their covenants made  In this law of nature consisteth the fountain and original of justice    when a covenant is made  then to break it is unjust and the definition of injustice is no other than the not performance of covenant  And whatsoever is not unjust is just   The fourth Law is that a man which receiveth benefit from another of mere grace  endeavour that he which giveth it  have no reasonable cause to repent him of his good will  Breach of this law is called ingratitude   The fifth Law is complaisance  that every man strive to accommodate himself to the rest  The observers of this law may be called sociable  the contrary  stubborn  insociable  froward  intractable   The sixth Law is that upon caution of the future time  a man ought to pardon the offences past of them that repenting  desire it   The seventh Law is that in revenges  men look not at the greatness of the evil past  but the greatness of the good to follow   The eighth Law is that no man by deed  word  countenance  or gesture  declare hatred or contempt of another  The breach of which law is commonly called contumely   The ninth Law is that every man acknowledge another for his equal by nature  The breach of this precept is pride   The tenth law is that at the entrance into the conditions of peace  no man require to reserve to himself any right  which he is not content should be reserved to every one of the rest  The breach of this precept is arrogance  and observers of the precept are called modest   The eleventh law is that if a man be trusted to judge between man and man  that he deal equally between them   The twelfth law is that such things as cannot be divided  be enjoyed in common  if it can be  and if the quantity of the thing permit  without stint  otherwise proportionably to the number of them that have right   The thirteenth law is the entire right  or else   the first possession  in the case of alternating use   of a thing that can neither be divided nor enjoyed in common should be determined by lottery   The fourteenth law is that those things which cannot be enjoyed in common  nor divided  ought to be adjudged to the first possessor  and in some cases to the first born  as acquired by lot   The fifteenth law is that all men that mediate peace be allowed safe conduct   The sixteenth law is that they that are at controversie  submit their Right to the judgement of an Arbitrator   The seventeenth law is that no man is a fit Arbitrator in his own cause   The eighteenth law is that no man should serve as a judge in a case if greater profit  or honour  or pleasure apparently ariseth  for him  out of the victory of one party  than of the other   The nineteenth law is that in a disagreement of fact  the judge should not give more weight to the testimony of one party than another  and absent other evidence  should give credit to the testimony of other witnesses  Hobbes s philosophy includes a frontal assault on the founding principles of the earlier natural legal tradition  disregarding the traditional association of virtue with happiness  and likewise re defining  law  to remove any notion of the promotion of the common good  Hobbes has no use for Aristotle s association of nature with human perfection  inverting Aristotle s use of the word  nature   Hobbes posits a primitive  unconnected state of nature in which men  having a  natural proclivity   to hurt each other  also have  a Right to every thing  even to one anothers body   and  nothing can be Unjust  in this  warre of every man against every man  in which human life is  solitary  poore  nasty  brutish  and short   Rejecting Cicero s view that men join in society primarily through  a certain social spirit which nature has implanted in man   Hobbes declares that men join in society simply for the purpose of  getting themselves out from that miserable condition of Warre  which is necessarily consequent   to the naturall Passions of men  when there is no visible Power to keep them in awe   As part of his campaign against the classical idea of natural human sociability  Hobbes inverts that fundamental natural legal maxim  the Golden Rule  Hobbes s version is  Do not that to another  which thou wouldst not have done to thy selfe    1 9  Cumberland s rebuttal of Hobbes  The English cleric Richard Cumberland wrote a lengthy and influential attack on Hobbes s depiction of individual self interest as the essential feature of human motivation  Historian Knud Haakonssen has noted that in the eighteenth century  Cumberland was commonly placed alongside Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf  in the triumvirate of seventeenth century founders of the  modern  school of natural law   The eighteenth century philosophers Shaftesbury and Hutcheson  were obviously inspired in part by Cumberland   Historian Jon Parkin likewise describes Cumberland s work as  one of the most important works of ethical and political theory of the seventeenth century   Parkin observes that much of Cumberland s material  is derived from Roman Stoicism  particularly from the work of Cicero  as  Cumberland deliberately cast his engagement with Hobbes in the mould of Cicero s debate between the Stoics  who believed that nature could provide an objective morality  and Epicureans  who argued that morality was human  conventional and self interested   In doing so  Cumberland de emphasized the overlay of Christian dogma  in particular  the doctrine of  original sin  and the corresponding presumption that humans are incapable of  perfecting  themselves without divine intervention  that had accreted to natural law in the Middle Ages   By way of contrast to Hobbes s multiplicity of laws  Cumberland states in the very first sentence of his Treatise of the Laws of Nature that  all the Laws of Nature are reduc d to that one  of Benevolence toward all Rationals   He later clarifies   By the name Rationals I beg leave to understand  as well God as Man  and I do it upon the Authority of Cicero   Cumberland argues that the mature development   perfection   of human nature involves the individual human willing and acting for the common good  For Cumberland  human interdependence precludes Hobbes s natural right of each individual to wage war against all the rest for personal survival  However  Haakonssen warns against reading Cumberland as a proponent of  enlightened self interest   Rather  the  proper moral love of humanity  is  a disinterested love of God through love of humanity in ourselves as well as others   Cumberland concludes that actions  principally conducive to our Happiness  are those that promote  the Honour and Glory of God  and also  Charity and Justice towards men   Cumberland emphasizes that desiring the well being of our fellow humans is essential to the  pursuit of our own Happiness   He cites  reason  as the authority for his conclusion that happiness consists in  the most extensive Benevolence   but he also mentions as  Essential Ingredients of Happiness  the  Benevolent Affections   meaning  Love and Benevolence towards others   as well as  that Joy  which arises from their Happiness    1 10  Liberal natural law  Liberal natural law grew out of the medieval Christian natural law theories and out of Hobbes  revision of natural law  sometimes in an uneasy balance of the two   Hugo Grotius based his philosophy of international law on natural law  In particular  his writings on freedom of the seas and just war theory directly appealed to natural law  About natural law itself  he wrote that  even the will of an omnipotent being cannot change or abrogate  natural law  which  would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible  that there is no God or that he does not care for human affairs    De iure belli ac pacis  Prolegomeni XI   This is the famous argument etiamsi daremus  non esse Deum   that made natural law no longer dependent on theology  However  German church historians Ernst Wolf and M  Elze disagreed and claimed that Grotius  concept of natural law did have a theological basis  In Grotius  view  the Old Testament contained moral precepts  e g  the Decalogue  which Christ confirmed and therefore were still valid  Moreover  they were useful in explaining the content of natural law  Both biblical revelation and natural law originated in God and could therefore not contradict each other   In a similar way  Samuel Pufendorf gave natural law a theological foundation and applied it to his concepts of government and international law   John Locke incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy  especially in Two Treatises of Government  There is considerable debate about whether his conception of natural law was more akin to that of Aquinas  filtered through Richard Hooker  or Hobbes  radical reinterpretation  though the effect of Locke s understanding is usually phrased in terms of a revision of Hobbes upon Hobbesean contractualist grounds  Locke turned Hobbes  prescription around  saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect  life  liberty  and property   people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one   While Locke spoke in the language of natural law  the content of this law was by and large protective of natural rights  and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred  Political philosopher Jeremy Waldron has pointed out that Locke s political thought was based on  a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions   To Locke  the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the Decalogue  Christ s teaching and exemplary life  and St  Paul s admonitions  Locke derived the concept of basic human equality  including the equality of the sexes   Adam and Eve    from   the starting point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei  One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free  governments need the consent of the governed  Thomas Jefferson  arguably echoing Locke  appealed to unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence   We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights  that among these are Life  Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness   The Lockean idea that governments need the consent of the governed was also fundamental to the Declaration of Independence  as the American Revolutionaries used it as justification for their separation from the British crown   The Belgian philosopher of law Frank van Dun is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception of natural law in the liberal tradition  Libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard argues that  the very existence of a natural law discoverable by reason is a potentially powerful threat to the status quo and a standing reproach to the reign of blindly traditional custom or the arbitrary will of the State apparatus   Ludwig von Mises states that he relaid the general sociological and economic foundations of the liberal doctrine upon utilitarianism  rather than natural law  but R A  Gonce argues that  the reality of the argument constituting his system overwhelms his denial   David Gordon notes   When most people speak of natural law  what they have in mind is the contention that morality can be derived from human nature  If human beings are rational animals of such and such a sort  then the moral virtues are    filling in the blanks is the difficult part     However  a secular critique of the natural law doctrine was stated by Pierre Charron in his De la sagesse  1601    The sign of a natural law must be the universal respect in which it is held  for if there was anything that nature had truly commanded us to do  we would undoubtedly obey it universally  not only would every nation respect it  but every individual  Instead there is nothing in the world that is not subject to contradiction and dispute  nothing that is not rejected  not just by one nation  but by many  equally  there is nothing that is strange and  in the opinion of many  unnatural that is not approved in many countries  and authorized by their customs    2  Contemporary Christian understanding  The Roman Catholic Church holds the view of natural law provided by St  Thomas Aquinas  particularly in his Summa Theologiae  and often as filtered through the School of Salamanca  This view is also shared by some Protestant churches  and was delineated by C S  Lewis in his works Mere Christianity and The Abolition of Man   The Catholic Church understands human beings to consist of body and mind  the physical and the non physical  or soul perhaps   and that the two are inextricably linked  Humans are capable of discerning the difference between good and evil because they have a conscience  There are many manifestations of the good that we can pursue  Some  like procreation  are common to other animals  while others  like the pursuit of truth  are inclinations peculiar to the capacities of human beings   To know what is right  one must use one s reason and apply it to Aquinas  precepts  This reason is believed to be embodied  in its most abstract form  in the concept of a primary precept   Good is to be sought  evil avoided   St  Thomas explains that   there belongs to the natural law  first  certain most general precepts  that are known to all  However  while the primary and immediate precepts cannot be  blotted out   the secondary precepts can be  Therefore  for a deontological ethical theory they are open to a surprisingly large amount of interpretation and flexibility  Any rule that helps man to live up to the primary or subsidiary precepts can be a secondary precept  for example   Drunkenness is wrong because it injures one s health  and worse  destroys one s ability to reason  which is fundamental to man as a rational animal  i e   does not support self preservation    Theft is wrong because it destroys social relations  and man is by nature a social animal  i e   does not support the subsidiary precept of living in society   Natural moral law is concerned with both exterior and interior acts  also known as action and motive  Simply doing the right thing is not enough  to be truly moral one s motive must be right as well  For example  helping an old lady across the road  good exterior act  to impress someone  bad interior act  is wrong  However  good intentions don t always lead to good actions  The motive must coincide with the cardinal or theological virtues  Cardinal virtues are acquired through reason applied to nature  they are   Prudence  Justice  Temperance  Fortitude The theological virtues are   Faith  Hope  Charity According to Aquinas  to lack any of these virtues is to lack the ability to make a moral choice  For example  consider a man who possesses the virtues of justice  prudence  and fortitude  yet lacks temperance  Due to his lack of self control and desire for pleasure  despite his good intentions  he will find himself swaying from the moral path   3  In contemporary jurisprudence  In jurisprudence  natural law can refer to the several doctrines   That just laws are immanent in nature  that is  they can be  discovered  or  found  but not  created  by such things as a bill of rights   That they can emerge by the natural process of resolving conflicts  as embodied by the evolutionary process of the common law  or  That the meaning of law is such that its content cannot be determined except by reference to moral principles  These meanings can either oppose or complement each other  although they share the common trait that they rely on inherence as opposed to design in finding just laws  Whereas legal positivism would say that a law can be unjust without it being any less a law  a natural law jurisprudence would say that there is something legally deficient about an unjust law  Legal interpretivism  famously defended in the English speaking world by Ronald Dworkin  claims to have a position different from both natural law and positivism   Besides utilitarianism and Kantianism  natural law jurisprudence has in common with virtue ethics that it is a live option for a first principles ethics theory in analytic philosophy   The concept of natural law was very important in the development of the English common law  In the struggles between Parliament and the monarch  Parliament often made reference to the Fundamental Laws of England  which were at times said to embody natural law principles since time immemorial and set limits on the power of the monarchy  According to William Blackstone  however  natural law might be useful in determining the content of the common law and in deciding cases of equity  but was not itself identical with the laws of England  Nonetheless  the implication of natural law in the common law tradition has meant that the great opponents of natural law and advocates of legal positivism  like Jeremy Bentham  have also been staunch critics of the common law   Natural law jurisprudence is currently undergoing a period of reformulation  as is legal positivism   The most prominent contemporary natural law jurist  Australian John Finnis  is based in Oxford  but there are also Americans Germain Grisez  Robert P  George  and Canadian Joseph Boyle  All have tried to construct a new version of natural law  The 19th century anarchist and legal theorist  Lysander Spooner  was also a figure in the expression of modern natural law    New Natural Law  as it is sometimes called  originated with Grisez  It focuses on  basic human goods   such as human life  knowledge  and aesthetic experience  which are self evidently and intrinsically worthwhile  and states that these goods reveal themselves as being incommensurable with one another   The tensions between the natural law and the positive law have played  and continue to play a key role in the development of international law   4  See also
