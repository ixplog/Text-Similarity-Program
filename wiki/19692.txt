Monopoly is an American originated board game originally published by Parker Brothers  Subtitled  The Fast Dealing Property Trading Game   the game is named after the economic concept of monopoly—the domination of a market by a single entity  It is produced by the United States game and toy company Hasbro  Players move around the gameboard buying or trading properties  developing their properties with houses and hotels  and collecting rent from their opponents  with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy   1  History  1 1  Early history  The history of Monopoly can be traced back to 1903  when an American woman named Elizabeth  Lizzie  J  Magie Phillips created a game through which she hoped to be able to explain the single tax theory of Henry George  it was intended as an educational tool to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies   Her game  The Landlord s Game  was self published  beginning in 1906  A series of variant board games based on her concept were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land   1 2  Origin  By 1933  a board game called Monopoly had been created which formed the basis of the game sold by Parker Brothers  beginning in 1935  Several people  mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast  contributed to the game s design and evolution  and this is when the game s design took on the 4×10 space to a side layout and familiar cards were produced  The original version of the game in this format was based on Atlantic City  New Jersey  By the 1970s  the idea that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore  it was printed in the game s instructions and even in the 1974 book The Monopoly Book  Strategy and Tactics of the World s Most Popular Game by Maxine Brady   1 3  1936–70  In 1936  Parker Brothers began licensing the game for sale outside of the United States  In 1941  the British Secret Intelligence Service had John Waddington Ltd   the licensed manufacturer of the game in the United Kingdom  create a special edition for World War II prisoners of war held by the Nazis  Hidden inside these games were maps  compasses  real money  and other objects useful for escaping  They were distributed to prisoners by Secret Service created fake charity groups   1 4  1970s–80s  Economics professor Ralph Anspach published a game Anti Monopoly in 1973  and was sued for trademark infringement by Parker Brothers in 1974  The case went to trial in 1976  Anspach won on appeals in 1979  as the 9th Circuit Court determined that the trademark Monopoly was generic  and therefore unenforceable  The United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case  allowing the appellate court ruling to stand  This decision was overturned by the passage of Public Law 98 620 in 1984  With that law in place  Parker Brothers and its parent companies  Hasbro  continue to hold valid trademarks for the game Monopoly   1 5  1990s–present  A new wave of licensed products began in 1994  when Hasbro granted a license to USAopoly to begin publishing a San Diego Edition of Monopoly  which has since been followed by over 100 more  Other licensees include Winning Moves Games  since 1995  and Winning Solutions  Inc   since 2000  in the United States  Winning Moves also has offices in the UK  France  Germany and Australia  and other licensees include AH Media in The Netherlands  and Bestman Games in Nigeria   2  Board  The Monopoly gameboard consists of 40 spaces containing 28 properties  22 colored streets  four railway stations and two utilities   three Chance spaces  three Community Chest spaces  a Luxury Tax space  an Income Tax space  and the four corner squares  GO   In  Jail Just Visiting  Free Parking  and Go to Jail   2 1  US versions  There have been some changes to the board since the original  Not all of the Chance and Community Chest cards as printed in the 1935 patent were used in editions from 1936 1937 onwards  and graphics with the Mr  Monopoly character were added in that same timeframe  A graphic of a chest containing coins was added to the Community Chest spaces  as were the flat purchase prices of all of the properties  Traditionally  the Community Chest cards were yellow  although they sometimes were printed on blue stock  with no decoration or text on the back  and the Chance cards were orange  likewise with no text or decoration on the back   Hasbro commissioned a major redesign to the US Standard Edition of the game in 2008  Among the changes  the colors of Mediterranean and Baltic Avenues  which changed from purple to brown   the colors of the GO square  which changed from red to black   the adoption of a flat $200 Income Tax  formerly the player s choice of $200 or 10% of their total holdings  which they may not calculate until after making their final decision   and increased $100 Luxury Tax amount  upped from $75   There were also changes to the Chance and Community Chest cards  for example  the  poor tax  and  grand opera opening  cards became  speeding fine  and  it is your birthday   respectively  though their effects remained the same  and the player must pay only $50 instead of $150 for the school tax  In addition  a player now gets $50 instead of $45 for sale of stock  and the Advance to Illinois Avenue card now has the added text concerning a player collecting $200 should they pass Go on the way there  Similar color and amount changes are used in the US Edition of the  Here and Now  World Edition  game  and are also used in the most recent versions of the McDonald s Monopoly promotion   All of the Chance and Community Chest cards received a graphic upgrade in 2008 as part of the graphic refresh of the game  Mr  Monopoly s classic line illustration was also now usually replaced by renderings of a 3D Mr  Monopoly model  The backs of the cards have their respective symbols  with Community Chest cards in blue  and Chance cards in orange   In the US versions shown below  the properties are named after locations in  or near  Atlantic City  New Jersey  Atlantic City s Illinois Avenue was renamed Martin Luther King Jr  Blvd  in the 1980s  St  Charles Place no longer exists  as the now defunct Showboat Casino Hotel was developed where it once ran   Marvin Gardens  the leading yellow property on the board shown  is a misspelling of the original location name  Marven Gardens  The misspelling was introduced by Charles and Olive Todd  who taught the game to Charles Darrow  and passed on when their homemade Monopoly board was copied by Darrow and thence to Parker Brothers  The Todds also changed the Atlantic City Quakers  Arctic Avenue to Mediterranean  and shortened the Shore Fast Line to the Short Line  It was not until 1995 that Parker Brothers acknowledged the misspelling of Marvin Gardens  formally apologizing to the residents of Marven Gardens   Short Line refers to the Shore Fast Line  a streetcar line that served Atlantic City  The B&O Railroad did not serve Atlantic City  A booklet included with the reprinted 1935 edition states that the four railroads that served Atlantic City in the mid 1930s were the Jersey Central  the Seashore Lines  the Reading Railroad  and the Pennsylvania Railroad   The Baltimore & Ohio  now part of CSX  was the parent of the Reading  There is a tunnel in Philadelphia where track to the south was B  & O  and track to the north is Reading  The Central of N J  did not have track to Atlantic City but was the daughter of the Reading  and granddaughter of the B  & O   Their track ran from the New York City area to Delaware Bay and some trains ran on the Reading controlled track to Atlantic City   The actual  Electric Company  and  Water Works  serving the city are respectively Atlantic City Electric Company  a subsidiary of Pepco Holdings  and the Atlantic City Municipal Utilities Authority   2 2  UK version  In the 1930s  John Waddington Ltd   Waddingtons  was a firm of printers from Leeds that had begun to branch out into packaging and the production of playing cards  Waddingtons had sent the card game Lexicon to Parker Brothers hoping to interest them in publishing the game in the United States  In a similar fashion  Parker Brothers sent over a copy of Monopoly to Waddingtons early in 1935 before the game had been put into production in the United States   The managing director of Waddingtons  Victor Watson  gave the game to his son Norman  who was head of the card games division  to test over the weekend  Norman was impressed by the game and persuaded his father to call Parker Brothers on Monday morning – transatlantic calls then being almost unheard of  This call resulted in Waddingtons obtaining a license to produce and market the game outside of the United States  Watson felt that for the game to be a success in the United Kingdom  the American locations would have to be replaced  so Victor and his secretary  Marjory Phillips  went to London to scout out locations  The Angel  Islington is not a street in London but a building  and the name of the road intersection it is located at   It was a coaching inn that stood on the Great North Road  By the 1930s  the inn had become a J  Lyons and Co  tea room  it is now a Co operative Bank   Some accounts say that Marjory and Victor met at the Angel to discuss the selection and celebrated the fact by including it on the Monopoly board  In 2003  a plaque commemorating the naming was unveiled at the site by Victor Watson s grandson  who is also named Victor   The standard British board  produced by Waddingtons  was for many years the version most familiar to people in countries in the Commonwealth  except Canada  where the US edition with Atlantic City area names was reprinted   although local variants of the board are now also found in several of these countries   In 1998  Winning Moves procured the Monopoly license from Hasbro and created new UK city and regional editions with sponsored squares  Winning Moves struggled to raise the sponsorship deals for the gameboards  but did so eventually  A Nottingham Graphic Design agency  TMA  produced the visual design of the Monopoly packaging  Initially  in December 1998  the game was sold in just a few WHSmith stores  but demand was high  with almost fifty thousand games shipped in the 4 weeks leading up to Christmas  Winning Moves still produces new city and regional editions annually  Nottingham based designers have been responsible for the games  visual design since 2001   The original income tax choice from the 1930s US board is replaced by a flat rate on the UK board  and the $75 Luxury Tax space is replaced with the £100 Super Tax space  the same as the current German board  In 2008  the US Edition was changed to match the UK and various European editions  including a flat $200 Income Tax value and an increased $100 Luxury Tax amount   The cases wherein the game was produced under license by a national company  the £  pound  was replaced by a $  dollar  sign  but the place names were unchanged   2 3  Post 2005 variations  Starting in the UK in 2005  an updated version of the game  titled Monopoly Here and Now  was produced  replacing game scenarios  properties  and tokens with modern equivalents  Similar boards were produced for Germany and France  Variants of these first editions appeared with Visa branded debit cards taking the place of cash – the later US  Electronic Banking  edition has unbranded debit cards   The success of the first Here and Now editions caused Hasbro US to allow online voting for 26 landmark properties across the United States to take their places along the gameboard  The popularity of this voting  in turn  caused the creation of similar websites  and secondary gameboards per popular vote to be created in the UK  Canada  France  Germany  Australia  New Zealand  Ireland  and other nations   In 2006  Winning Moves Games released the Mega Edition  with a 30% larger gameboard and revised game play  Other streets from Atlantic City  eight  one per color group  were included  along with a third  utility   the Gas Company  In addition  $1 000 denomination notes  first seen in Winning Moves  Monopoly  The Card Game  are included  Game play is further changed with bus tickets  allowing non dice roll movement along one side of the board   a speed die  itself adopted into variants of the Atlantic City standard edition  see below   skyscrapers  after houses and hotels   and train depots that can be placed on the Railroad spaces   This edition was adapted for the UK market in 2007  and is sold by Winning Moves UK  After the initial US release  critiques of some of the rules caused the company to issue revisions and clarifications on their website   2 3 1  Monopoly Here and Now  In September 2006  the US edition of Monopoly Here and Now was released  This edition features top landmarks across the US  The properties were decided by votes over the Internet in the spring of 2006   Monetary values are multiplied by 10 000  e g   one collects $2 000 000 instead of $200 for passing GO and pays that much for Income Tax  or 10% of their total  as this edition was launched prior to 2008   each player starts with $15 000 000 instead of $1 500  etc    Also  the Chance and Community Chest cards are updated  the Railroads are replaced by Airports  Chicago O Hare  Los Angeles International  New York City s JFK  and Atlanta s Hartsfield Jackson   and the Utilities  Electric Company and Water Works  are replaced by Service Providers  Internet Service Provider and Cell Phone Service Provider   The houses and hotels are blue and silver  not green and red as in most editions of Monopoly  The board uses the traditional US layout  the cheapest properties are purple  not brown  and  Interest on Credit Card Debt  replaces  Luxury Tax   Despite the updated Luxury Tax space  and the Income Tax space no longer using the 10% option  this edition uses paper Monopoly money  and not an electronic banking unit like the Here and Now World Edition  However  a similar edition of Monopoly  the Electronic Banking edition  does feature an electronic banking unit and bank cards  as well as a different set of tokens  Both Here and Now and Electronic Banking feature an updated set of tokens from the Atlantic City edition   It is also notable that three states  California  Florida and Texas  are represented by two cities each  Los Angeles and San Francisco  Miami and Orlando  and Dallas and Houston respectively   No other state is represented by more than one city  not including the airports   One landmark  Texas Stadium  has been demolished and no longer exists  Another landmark  Jacobs Field  still exists  but was renamed Progressive Field in 2008   3  Equipment  All property deeds  houses  and hotels are held by the bank until bought by the players  A standard set of Monopoly pieces includes   3 1  Cards  A deck of 32 Chance and Community Chest cards  16 Chance and 16 Community Chest  which players draw when they land on the corresponding squares of the track  and follow the instructions printed on them   3 2  Deeds  A title deed for each property is given to a player to signify ownership  and specifies purchase price  mortgage value  the cost of building houses and hotels on that property  and the various rent prices depending on how developed the property is  Properties include   22 streets  divided into 8 color groups of two or three streets  a player must own all of a color group in order to build houses or hotels  Once achieved  color group properties must be improved or  broken down  evenly  See the section on Rules   4 railroads  players collect $25 rent if they own one station  $50 for two  $100 for three  $200 for all four  These are usually replaced by railroad stations in non US editions of Monopoly   2 utilities  rent is four times the dice value if one utility is owned  but ten times if both are owned  Hotels and houses cannot be built on utilities or stations  Some country editions have a fixed rent for utilities  for example  the Italian editions has a L  2 000  $20  rent if one utility is owned  or L  10 000  $100  if both are owned  The purchase prices for the various properties vary from $60 to $400 on a US Standard Edition set   3 3  Dice  A pair of six sided dice   In 2007  a third  Speed Die  was added for variation    3 4  Houses and hotels  32 houses and 12 hotels made of wood or plastic  the original and current Deluxe Edition have wooden houses and hotels  the current  base set  uses plastic buildings   Unlike money  houses and hotels have a finite supply  If no more are available  no substitute is allowed   3 5  Money  Older US standard editions of the game included a total of $15 140 in the following denominations   20 $500 bills  orange   20 $100 bills  beige   30 $50 bills  blue   50 $20 bills  green   40 $10 bills  yellow   40 $5 bills  pink   40 $1 bills  white  Newer  September 2008 and later  US editions instead provide a total of $20 580—30 of each denomination  The colors of some of the bills also changed  $10s are now blue instead of yellow  $20s are a brighter color green than before  and $50s are now purple instead of blue   Each player begins the game with his or her token on the Go square  and $1 500  or 1 500 of a localized currency  in play money  2 500 with the Speed Die   Prior to September 2008  the money was divided with greater numbers of 20 and 10 dollar bills  Since then  the US version has taken on the British version s initial cash distributions   Although the US version is indicated as allowing eight players  the above cash distribution is not possible with all eight players since it requires 32 $100 bills and 40 $1 bills  However  the amount of cash contained in the game is enough for eight players with a slight alteration of bill distribution   3 5 1  International currencies  Pre Euro German editions of the game started with 30 000  Spielmark  in eight denominations  abbreviated as  M     and later used seven denominations of the  Deutsche Mark    DM     In the classic Italian game  each player received L  350 000  $3500  in a two player game  but L  50 000  $500  less for each player more than two  Only in a six player game does a player receive the equivalent of $1 500  The classic Italian games were played with only four denominations of currency  Both Spanish editions  the Barcelona and Madrid editions  started the game with 150 000 in play money  with a breakdown identical to that of the American version   3 5 2  Extra currency  Monopoly money is theoretically unlimited  if the bank runs out of money the players must make do with other markers  or calculate on paper  Additional paper money can be bought at certain locations  notably game and hobby stores  or downloaded from various websites and printed and cut by hand   One such site has created a $1 000 bill  while a $1 000 bill can be found in Monopoly  The Mega Edition and Monopoly  The Card Game  both published by Winning Moves Games   this note is not a standard denomination for  classic  versions of Monopoly    3 6  Tokens  Each player is represented by a small metal token that is moved around the edge of the board according to the roll of two six sided dice  The number of tokens  and the tokens themselves  have changed over the history of the game  with many appearing in special editions only  and some available with non game purchases  As of 2013  eight tokens are included in standard edition games  including   Wheelbarrow  Battleship  Racecar  Thimble  Old style shoe  or boot   Scottie dog  Top hat  Cat  added in 2013  Previous tokens retired in the 1950s  replaced by the dog  man on horseback  and wheelbarrow    Lantern  Purse  Rocking horse Other retired tokens   Sack of money  1999–2007 editions  won a 1998 contest over a piggy bank and biplane   Man on horseback  Iron  1935–2013 editions   Howitzer  better known as a cannon  Steam Locomotive  Only in Deluxe Editions  Tokens exclusive to certain editions include the locomotive  which was available only in the Deluxe Edition of the game  Tokens retired in 2008 and 2013 are still available in Monopoly  The Classic Edition  Tokens available without the gameboard included replicas of certain cars when purchased with licensed Johnny Lightning products  or a special Director s Chair token when purchased with Limited Edition DVD and Blu ray copies of the documentary Under the Boardwalk  The MONOPOLY Story   Many of the early tokens were created by companies such as Dowst Miniature Toy Company  which made metal charms and tokens designed to be used on charm bracelets  The battleship and cannon were also used briefly in the Parker Brothers war game Conflict  released in 1940   but after the game failed on the market  the premade pieces were recycled into Monopoly usage  Hasbro recently adopted the battleship and cannon for Diplomacy   Early localized editions of the standard edition  including some Canadian editions  which used the US board layout  did not include pewter tokens but instead had generic wooden pawns identical to those in Sorry   Parker Brothers also acquired Sorry  in the 1930s   In 1998  a Hasbro advertising campaign asked the public to vote on a new playing piece to be added to the set  resulting in a  bag of money  token being added to the US edition  This piece was retired in 2007  In 2013  a similar promotional campaign was launched encouraging the public to vote on one of several possible new tokens to replace an existing one  The choices were a guitar  a diamond ring  a helicopter  a robot  or a cat  Unlike in 1998  one piece is to be retired  in this case the iron  and will be replaced by a new token  the cat  Both were chosen by a vote that ran on Facebook from January 8 to February 5  2013  Shortly after the Facebook voting campaign  a limited edition golden token set was released exclusively at various national retailers  such as Target in the US and Tesco in the UK  This set contained the 2008 2013 tokens as listed above  and also contained all five of the iron s potential replacements  the cat  a guitar  a diamond ring  a helicopter and a robot   4  Rules  4 1  Official rules  Players take turns in order  with the initial player determined by chance before the game  A typical turn begins with the rolling of the dice and advancing their piece clockwise around the board the corresponding number of squares  If a player rolls doubles  they roll again after completing their turn  If a player rolls three consecutive sets of doubles on one turn  the player has been  caught speeding   and the player is immediately sent to jail instead of moving the amount shown on the dice for the third roll  ending the player s turn   A player who lands or passes the Go space collects $200  unless they automatically go to jail   Players who land on either Income Tax or Luxury Tax pay the indicated amount to the bank  In older editions of the game  two options were given for Income Tax  either pay a flat fee of $200 or 10% of the player s total worth  including the current values of all the properties and buildings owned   Players must choose which option before calculating their total worth  and cannot change their mind if it turns out that the $200 was actually less  in 2008  the 10% option was removed  Luxury Tax was originally $75  in 2008  it was increased to $100  Free Parking is just a  free  space  players who land here neither gain nor lose anything   4 1 1  Chance Community Chest  If a player lands on Chance or Community Chest  they draw the top card from the respective pile and obey its instructions  This may include collecting or paying the bank a specified amount of money  or automatically moving to a specific space on the board  Two types of cards that involve jail   Go to Jail  and  Get Out of Jail Free   are explained below   4 1 2  Jail  A player will land in jail if they land on  Go to Jail   throw three straight doubles in a turn  or draw a Community Chest or Chance Card saying  Go to Jail   When a player is sent to jail they move there directly   Do not pass Go  Do not collect $200    and their turn ends  If the player is not  sent  to jail but just lands on that space  they are  Just Visiting   incur no penalty and move in the usual manner on their next turn   If a player is in jail  they do not take a normal turn and must either pay a fine of $50 to be released from jail  use a Chance or Community Chest Get Out of Jail Free card  or attempt to roll doubles on the dice  If a player fails to roll doubles  they lose their turn  Failure to roll doubles thrice will result in paying the $50 fine  or use a Get out of Jail Free card  to be released  While a player is in jail  they may not buy property directly  by virtue of not being able to land on the properties  However  they may sell  trade and mortgage properties  purchase buildings  participate in auctions  and collect rents  If a player does roll doubles to exit Jail  they may immediately move according to the roll  but they cannot roll a second time after exiting jail  If the player instead pays the $50 fine or uses a Get out of Jail Free card and then rolls doubles  they are required to move the amount shown on the dice and then roll again   4 1 3  Properties  If the player lands on an unowned property  whether street  railroad  or utility  they can buy the property for its listed purchase price  If they decline this purchase  the property is auctioned off by the bank to the highest bidder  including the player who declined to buy  If the property landed on is already owned and unmortgaged  they must pay the owner a given rent  the price dependent on whether the property is part of a set or its level of development   When a player owns all of the properties in a color group and none of them are mortgaged  they may develop them during their turn or in between other player s turns  Development involves buying miniature houses or hotels from the bank and placing them on the property spaces  and must be done uniformly across the group  That is  a second house cannot be built on any property within a group until all of them have one house  Once the player owns an entire group  they can collect double rent for any undeveloped properties within it  Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities  the given rent also increases if a player owns more than one of either type  If there is more demand for houses to be built than what remains in the bank  then a housing auction is conducted to determine who will get to purchase each house   4 1 4  Mortgaging  Properties can also be mortgaged  although all developments on a monopoly must be sold before any property of that color can be mortgaged or traded  The player receives money from the bank for each mortgaged property  half of the purchase price   which must be repaid with 10% interest to unmortgage  Houses and hotels can be sold back to the bank for half their purchase price  Players cannot collect rent on mortgaged properties and may not give improved property away to others  however  trading mortgaged properties is allowed  The player receiving the mortgaged property must immediately unmortgage it for the mortgage price plus 10%  or pay the bank just the 10% amount and keep the property mortgaged  if the player chooses the latter  they must still pay the 10% again if the property is later unmortgaged   4 1 5  Bankruptcy  A player who cannot pay what they owe is bankrupt and eliminated from the game  If the bankrupt player owes the bank  they must turn all of their assets over to the bank  who then auctions off their properties  if they have any   except buildings  If the debt is instead to another player  all the assets are instead given to that opponent  but the new owner must still pay the bank to un mortgage any such properties received  The winner is the remaining player left after all the others have gone bankrupt   4 2  Rule modifications  From 1936  the rules booklet included with each Monopoly set contained a short section at the end providing rules for making the game shorter  either by setting a time limit  or by ending the game after the second player goes bankrupt  As well  an additional rules booklet or sheet was included giving the rules for a short variant with several changes  such as starting each player out with two properties selected at random  A later version of the rules included this variant  along with the time limit game  in the main rules booklet  omitting the second bankruptcy method as a third short game   4 3  House rules  Many house rules have emerged for the game since its creation  A popular one is the  Free Parking jackpot rule   where money paid in fines is stockpiled on the Free Parking space instead of being returned to the bank  When a player lands on that square  they may take the money  House rules that slow or prevent money being returned to the bank in this way have a side effect of increasing the time it takes for players to become bankrupt  lengthening the game considerably  as well as decreasing the effects of strategy and prudent investment   House rules that increase the amount of money in the game may change the strategies of the players  such as changing the relative value of different properties  For instance  with the official rules  players can rarely afford to build significant numbers of houses on the third and fourth sides of the board  but with more money in the game  this strategy may become more workable   Video game and computer game versions of Monopoly have options where popular house rules can be used  In 2014  Hasbro determined five popular house rules by public Facebook vote  and released a  House Rules edition  of the board game  Rules selected include collecting paid fines on Free Parking  forcing players to traverse the board once before buying properties  and awarding money for players rolling a double 1 on the dice   5  Strategy  According to Jim Slater in The Mayfair Set  the Orange property group is the best to own because players land on them more often  as a result of the Chance cards Go to Jail  Advance to St  Charles Place  Pall Mall   Advance to Reading Railroad  Marylebone Station  and Go Back Three Spaces   In all  during game play  Illinois Avenue  Trafalgar Square   New York Avenue  Vine Street   B&O Railroad  Fenchurch Street Station   and Reading Railroad  Marylebone Station  are the most frequently landed upon properties  Mediterranean Avenue  Old Kent Road   Baltic Avenue  Whitechapel Road   Park Place  Park Lane   and Oriental Avenue  The Angel Islington  are the least landed upon properties  Among the property groups  the Railroads are most frequently landed upon  as no other group has four properties  Orange has the next highest frequency  followed by Red   5 1  End game  One common criticism of Monopoly is that although it has carefully defined termination conditions  it may take an unlimited amount of time to reach them  Edward P  Parker  a former president of Parker Brothers  is quoted as saying   We always felt that forty five minutes was about the right length for a game  but Monopoly could go on for hours  Also  a game was supposed to have a definite end somewhere  In Monopoly you kept going around and around    Hasbro states that the longest game of Monopoly ever played lasted 1 680 hours  70 days or 10 weeks or 2 months    6  Related games  6 1  Add ons  Numerous add ons have been made for Monopoly  sold independently from the game both before its commercialization and after  with three official ones discussed below   6 1 1  Stock Exchange  The original Stock Exchange add on was published by Capitol Novelty Co  of Rensselaer  New York in early 1936  It was marketed as an add on for Monopoly  Finance  or Easy Money games  Shortly after Capitol Novelty introduced Stock Exchange  Parker Brothers bought it from them then marketed their own  slightly redesigned  version as an add on specifically for their  new  Monopoly game  the Parker Brothers version was available in June 1936  The Free Parking square is covered over by a new Stock Exchange space and the add on included three Chance and three Community Chest cards directing the player to  Advance to Stock Exchange   The Stock Exchange add on was later redesigned and rereleased in 1992 under license by Chessex  this time including a larger number of new Chance and Community Chest cards  This version included ten new Chance cards  five  Advance to Stock Exchange  and five other related cards  and eleven new Community Chest cards  five  Advance to Stock Exchange  and six other related cards  the regular Community Chest card  From sale of stock you get $45  is removed from play when using these cards   Many of the original rules applied to this new version  in fact  one optional play choice allows for playing in the original form by only adding the  Advance to Stock Exchange  cards to each deck    A Monopoly Stock Exchange Edition was released in 2001  although not in the US   this time adding an electronic calculator like device to keep track of the complex stock figures  This was a full edition  not just an add on  that came with its own board  money and playing pieces  Properties on the board were replaced by companies on which shares could be floated  and offices and home offices  instead of houses and hotels  could be built   6 1 2  Playmaster  Playmaster  another official add on  released in 1982  is an electronic device that keeps track of all player movement and dice rolls as well as what properties are still available  It then uses this information to call random auctions and mortgages making it easier to free up cards of a color group  It also plays eight short tunes when key game functions occur  for example when a player lands on a railroad it plays  I ve Been Working on the Railroad   and a police car s siren sounds when a player goes to Jail   6 1 3  Get Out of Jail and Free Parking Mini Games  In 2009  Hasbro released two mini games that can be played as stand alone games or combined with the Monopoly game  In Get Out of Jail  the goal is to manipulate a spade under a jail cell in an attempt to flick out various colored prisoners  The game can be used

 is rolled while there are unowned properties  the player advances forward to the nearest one  Otherwise  the player advances to the nearest property on which rent is owed   The Speed Die is used throughout the game in the  Mega Edition   while in the  Regular Edition  it is used by any player who has passed GO at least once  In these editions it remains optional  although use of the Speed Die was made mandatory for use in the 2009 US & World MONOPOLY Championship   6 2  Spinoffs  Parker Brothers and its licensees have also sold several spin offs of Monopoly  These are not add ons  as they

Although in the past  US entrants had to successfully compete in regional competitions before the national championship  qualifying for the National Championship has been online since 2003  For the 2003 Championship  qualification was limited to the first fifty people who correctly completed an online quiz  Out of concerns that such methods of qualifying might not always ensure a competition of the best players  the 2009 Championship qualifying was expanded to include an online multiple choice quiz  a score of 80% or better was required to advance   followed by an online five question essay test  followed by a two game online tournament at Pogo com  The process was to have produced a field of 23 plus one  Matt McNally  the 2003 national champion  who received a bye and was not required to qualify  However  at the end of the online tournament  there was an eleven way tie for the last six spots  The decision was made to invite all of those who had tied for said spots  In fact  two of those who had tied and would have otherwise been eliminated  Dale Crabtree of Indianapolis  Indiana  and Brandon Baker  of Tuscaloosa  Alabama  played in the final game and finished third and fourth respectively   The 2009 Monopoly US National Championship was held on April 14–15 in Washington  D C  In his first tournament ever  Richard Marinaccio  an attorney from Sloan  New York  a suburb of Buffalo   prevailed over a field that included two previous champions to be crowned the 2009 US National Champion  In addition to the title  Mr  Marinaccio took home $20 580 — the amount of money in the bank of the board game — and competed in the 2009 World Championship in Las Vegas  Nevada on October 21–22  where he finished in third place   8 2  World Championship  Hasbro conducts a worldwide Monopoly tournament  The first Monopoly World Championships took place in Grossinger s Resort in New York  in November 1973  but it wasn t until 1975 that they included competitors from outside the

Monopoly money  in the current Monopoly set used in the tournament   9  Variants  Because Monopoly evolved in the public domain before its commercialization  Monopoly has seen many variant games  The game is licensed in 103 countries and printed in 37 languages  Most of the variants are exact copies of the Monopoly games with the street names replaced with locales from a particular town  university  or fictional place  National boards have been released as well  Over the years  many specialty Monopoly editions  licensed by Parker Brothers Hasbro  and produced by them  or their licensees  including USAopoly and Winning Moves Games  have been sold to local and national markets worldwide  Two well known  families  of  opoly like games  without licenses from Parker Brothers Hasbro  have also been produced   Several published games similar to Monopoly include   Anti Monopoly  one of several games that are a sort of monopoly backwards  The name of this game led to legal action between Anti Monopoly s creator  Ralph Anspach  and the owners of Monopoly   Business  a Monopoly like game not associated with Hasbro  In this version the  properties  to be bought are cities of India  Chance and Community Chest reference lists of results printed in the center of the board  keyed to the dice roll  and money is represented by counters  not paper   Dostihy a sázky  a variant

racing theme   Ghettopoly  released in 2003  caused considerable offense upon its release  The game  intended to be a humorous rendering of ghetto life  was decried as racist for its unflinching use of racial stereotypes  Hasbro sought and received an injunction against Ghettopoly s designer   Make Your Own  OPOLY  This game allows you to customize the board  money  and rules to your liking   9 1

website for the vote  Jerusalem  was chosen as one of the 20 cities to be featured in the newest Monopoly World Edition  Before the vote took place  a Hasbro employee in the London office eliminated the country signifier  Israel  after the city  in response to pressure from pro Palestinian advocacy groups  After the Israeli government protested  Hasbro Inc  issued a statement that read   It was a bad decision  one that we rectified relatively quickly  This is a game  We never wanted to enter into any political debate  We apologize to our Monopoly fans    9 4  Deluxe editions  Hasbro sells a
