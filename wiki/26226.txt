A rhyme is a repetition of similar sounds  or the same sound  in two or more words  most often in the final syllables of lines in poems and songs  The word  rhyme  may also be used as a pars pro toto   a part  taken  for the whole   to refer a short poem  such as a rhyming couplet or other brief rhyming poem such as nursery rhymes   1  Function of rhyming words  Rhyme partly seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear  It also serves as a powerful mnemonic device  facilitating memorization  The regular use of tail rhyme helps to mark off the ends of lines  thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener  As with other poetic techniques  poets use it to suit their own purposes  for example William Shakespeare often used a rhyming couplet to mark off the end of a scene in a play   2  Types of rhyme  The word rhyme can be used in a specific and a general sense  In the specific sense  two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical  two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words  A rhyme in the strict sense is also called a perfect rhyme  Examples are sight and flight  deign and gain  madness and sadness   2 1  Perfect rhymes  Perfect rhymes can be classified according to the number of syllables included in the rhyme  which is dictated by the location of the final stressed syllable   masculine  a rhyme in which the stress is on the final syllable of the words  rhyme  sublime   feminine  a rhyme in which the stress is on the penultimate  second from last  syllable of the words  picky  tricky   dactylic  a rhyme in which the stress is on the antepenultimate  third from last  syllable  cacophonies  Aristophanes   2 2  General rhymes  In the general sense  general rhyme can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words  and to the use of such similar sounding words in organizing verse  Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity   syllabic  a rhyme in which the last syllable of each word sounds the same but does not necessarily contain stressed vowels   cleaver  silver  or pitter  patter  the final syllable of the words bottle and fiddle are   a liquid consonant    imperfect  or near   a rhyme between a stressed and an unstressed syllable   wing  caring   weak  or unaccented   a rhyme between two sets of one or more unstressed syllables   hammer  carpenter   semirhyme  a rhyme with an extra syllable on one word   bend  ending   forced  or oblique   a rhyme with an imperfect match in sound   green  fiend  one  thumb   assonance  matching vowels   shake  hate  Assonance is sometimes referred to as slant rhymes  along with consonance   consonance  matching consonants   rabies  robbers   half rhyme  or slant rhyme   matching final consonants   bent  ant   pararhyme  all consonants match   tell  tall   alliteration  or head rhyme   matching initial consonants   ship  short   2 3  Identical rhymes  Identical rhymes are considered less than perfect in English poetry  but are valued more highly in other literatures such as  for example  rime riche in French poetry   Though homophones and homonyms satisfy the first condition for rhyming—that is  that the stressed vowel sound is the same—they do not satisfy the second  that the preceding consonant be different  As stated above  in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words   If the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical  the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all  An example of such a  super rhyme  or  more than perfect rhyme  is the  identical rhyme   in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical  as in gun and begun  Punning rhymes such are  bare  and  bear  are also identical rhymes  The rhyme may extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel  If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line  so that there are two lines that sound identical  then it is called a  holorhyme    For I scream For ice cream     In poetics these would be considered identity  rather than rhyme   2 4  Eye rhyme  Eye rhymes or sight rhymes or spelling rhymes refer to similarity in spelling but not in sound where the final sounds are spelled identically but pronounced differently  Examples in English are cough  bough  and love  move   Some early written poetry appears to contain these  but in many cases the words used rhymed at the time of writing  and subsequent changes in pronunciation have meant that the rhyme is now lost   2 5  Mind rhyme  Mind rhyme is a kind of substitution rhyme similar to rhyming slang  but it is less generally codified and is “heard” only when generated by a specific verse context  For instance  “this sugar is neat   and tastes so sour ” If a reader or listener thinks of the word “sweet” instead of “sour”  then a mind rhyme has occurred   2 6  Classification by position  Rhymes may be classified according to their position in the verse   Tail rhyme  also called end rhyme or rime couée  is a rhyme in the final syllable s  of a verse  the most common kind    Internal rhyme occurs when a word or phrase in the interior of a line rhymes with a word or phrase at the end of a line  or within a different line   Off centered rhyme is a type of internal rhyme occurring in unexpected places in a given line  This is sometimes called a misplaced rhyme scheme or a spoken word rhyme style   Holorime  mentioned above  occurs when two entire lines have the same sound   Broken rhyme is a type of enjambement producing a rhyme by dividing a word at the line break of a poem to make a rhyme with the end word of another line   Cross rhyme matches a sound or sounds at the end of a line with the same sound or sounds in the middle of the following  or preceding  line  A rhyme scheme is the pattern of rhyming lines in a poem   3  History  In many languages  including modern European languages and Arabic  poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms  such as ballads  sonnets and rhyming couplets  Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language  culture or period  while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages  cultures or time periods  However  the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition  Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes   The earliest surviving evidence of rhyming is the Chinese Shi Jing  ca  10th century BC   Rhyme is also occasionally used in the Bible  Overwhelmingly  Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme  But rhyme is used very occasionally  For instance  Catullus includes partial rhymes in the poem Cui dono lepidum novum libellum  The ancient Greeks knew rhyme  and rhymes in The Wasps by Aristophanes are noted by a translator   According to some archaic sources  Irish literature introduced the rhyme to Early Medieval Europe  though this is a disputed claim  in the 7th century we find the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection  Also in the 7th Century  rhyme was used in the Qur an  The leonine verse is notable for introducing rhyme into High Medieval literature in the 12th century   Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages  in part under the influence of the Arabic language in Al Andalus  modern Spain   Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century  as in their long  rhyming qasidas   Since languages change over time  lines which rhymed in the past may no longer rhyme in today s language and it may not be clear how one would pronounce the words so that they rhyme  For example    Should we really sing  harmonious jine   or  songs divoin      3 1  Etymology  The word is derived from Old French rime or ryme  which may be derived from Old Frankish *rīm  a Germanic term meaning  series  sequence  attested in Old English  Old English rīm meaning  enumeration  series  numeral   and Old High German rīm  ultimately cognate to Old Irish rím  Greek arithmos  number   Alternatively  the Old French words may derive from Latin rhythmus  from Greek  rhythmos  rhythm    The spelling rhyme  from original rime  was introduced at the beginning of the Modern English period  due to a learned  but perhaps etymologically incorrect  association with Latin rhythmus  The older spelling rime survives in Modern English as a rare alternative spelling  A distinction between the spellings is also sometimes made in the study of linguistics and phonology  where rime rhyme is used to refer to the nucleus and coda of a syllable  In this context  some prefer to spell this rime to separate it from the poetic rhyme covered by this article  see syllable rime    4  Rhyme in various languages  4 1  Arabic  Some sura  chapters  of the Qur’an are written in saj‘  a prose genre that uses end rhymes  This particular style was widespread in the Arabic peninsula during the time of the Qur’an s appearance   4 2  Celtic languages  Rhyming in the Celtic Languages takes a drastically different course from most other Western rhyming schemes despite strong contact with the Romance and English patterns  Even today  despite extensive interaction with English and French culture  Celtic rhyme continues to demonstrate native characteristics  Brian Ó Cuív sets out the rules of rhyme in Irish poetry of the classical period  the last stressed vowel and any subsequent long vowels must be identical in order for two words to rhyme  Consonants are grouped into six classes for the purpose of rhyme  they need not be identical  but must belong to the same class  Thus  b  and  d  can rhyme  both being  voiced plosives    as can  bh  and  l   which are both  voiced continuants   but  l   a  voiced continuant   cannot rhyme with  ph   a  voiceless continuant   Furthermore   for perfect rhyme a palatalized consonant may be balanced only by a palatalized consonant and a velarized consonant by a velarized one   In the post Classical period  these rules fell into desuetude  and in popular verse simple assonance often suffices  as can be seen in an example of Irish Gaelic rhyme from the traditional song Bríd Óg Ní Mháille   Translation  Oh young Bridget O Malley   You have left my heart breaking  Here the vowels are the same  but the consonants  although both palatalized  do not fall into the same class in the bardic rhyming scheme   4 3  Chinese  Besides the vowel consonant aspect of rhyming  Chinese language rhymes often include tone quality  that is  tonal contour  as an integral linguistic factor in determining rhyme   Use of rhyme in Classical Chinese poetry typically but not always appears in the form of paired couplets  with end rhyming in the final syllable of each couplet   Another important aspect of rhyme in regard to Chinese language studies is the study or reconstruction of past varieties of Chinese  such as Middle Chinese   4 4  English  Old English poetry is mostly alliterative verse  One of the earliest rhyming poems in English is The Rhyming Poem   As English is a language in which stress is important  lexical stress is one of the factors affecting the similarity of sounds for the perception of rhyme  Perfect rhyme can be defined as the case when two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical   Some words in English  such as  orange  and  silver   are commonly regarded as having no rhyme  Although a clever writer can get around this  for example  by obliquely rhyming  orange  with combinations of words like  door hinge  or with lesser known words like  Blorenge  – a hill in Wales – or the surname Gorringe   it is generally easier to move the word out of rhyming position or replace it with a synonym   orange  could become  amber    Silver  could become a combination of  bright and argent     One view of rhyme in English is from John Milton s preface to Paradise Lost   A more tempered view is taken by W  H  Auden in The Dyer s Hand   Forced or clumsy rhyme is often a key ingredient of doggerel   4 5  French  In French poetry  unlike in English  it is common to have  identical rhymes   in which not only the vowels of the final syllables of the lines rhyme  but their onset consonants   consonnes d appui   as well  To the ear of someone accustomed to English verse  this often sounds like a very weak rhyme  For example  an English perfect rhyme of homophones  flour and flower  would seem weak  whereas a French rhyme of homophones doigt and doit is not only acceptable but quite common   Rhymes are sometimes classified into the categories  rime pauvre    poor rhyme     rime suffisante    sufficient rhyme     rime riche    rich rhyme   and  rime richissime    very rich rhyme    according to the number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses  For example to rhyme  parla  with  sauta  would be a poor rhyme  the words have only the vowel in common   to rhyme  pas  with  bras  a sufficient rhyme  with the vowel and the silent consonant in common   and  tante  with  attente  a rich rhyme  with the vowel  the onset consonant  and the coda consonant with its mute  e  in common   Authorities disagree  however  on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories   Holorime is an extreme example of rime richissime spanning an entire verse  Alphonse Allais was a notable exponent of holorime  Here is an example of a holorime couplet from Marc Monnier   Classical French rhyme not only differs from English rhyme in its different treatment of onset consonants  It also treats coda consonants in a distinctive way   French spelling includes several final letters that are no longer pronounced  and that in many cases have never been pronounced  Such final unpronounced letters continue to affect rhyme according to the rules of Classical French versification  They are encountered in almost all of the pre 20th century French verse texts  but these rhyming rules are almost never taken into account from the 20th century   The most important  silent  letter is the  mute e   In spoken French today  final  e  is  in some regional accents  in Paris for example   omitted after consonants  but in Classical French prosody  it was considered an integral part of the rhyme even when following the vowel   Joue  could rhyme with  boue   but not with  trou   Rhyming words ending with this silent  e  were said to make up a  feminine rhyme   while words not ending with this silent  e  made up a  masculine rhyme   It was a principle of stanza formation that masculine and feminine rhymes had to alternate in the stanza  All 17th century French plays in verse alternate masculine and feminine alexandrine couplets   The  silent  final consonants present a more complex case  They  too  were considered an integral part of the rhyme  so that  pont  could rhyme only with  vont  and not with  long   but this cannot be reduced to a simple rule about the spelling  since  pont  would also rhyme with  rond  even though one word ends in  t  and the other in  d   This is because the correctness of the rhyme depends not on the spelling on the final consonant  but on how it would have been pronounced  There are a few simple rules that govern word final consonants in French prosody   The consonants must  rhyme  give or take their voicing  So  d  and  t  rhyme because they differ only in voicing  So too with  g  and  c   and  p  and  b   and also  s  and  z   and  x     Rhyming words ending with a silent  s   x  or  z  are called  plural rhymes     Nasal vowels rhyme no matter what their spelling    Essaim  can rhyme with  sain   but not with  saint  because the final  t  counts in  saint     If the word ends in a consonant cluster  only the final consonant counts    Temps  rhymes with  lents  because both end in  s    In fact  only the  silent  final consonants which would be able to be pronounced the same way  if they were followed by a vowel  are able to rhyme together   4 6  Greek  4 7  Hebrew  Ancient Hebrew verse generally did not employ rhyme  However  many Jewish liturgical poems rhyme today  because they were written in medieval Europe  where rhymes were in vogue   4 8  Latin  In Latin rhetoric and poetry homeoteleuton and alliteration were frequently used devices   Tail rhyme was occasionally used  as in this piece of poetry by Cicero   But tail rhyme was not used as a prominent structural feature of Latin poetry until it was introduced under the influence of local vernacular traditions in the early Middle Ages  This is the Latin hymn Dies Irae   Medieval poetry may mix Latin and vernacular languages  Mixing languages in verse or rhyming words in different languages is termed macaronic   4 9  Portuguese  Portuguese classifies rhymes in the following manner   rima pobre  poor rhyme   rhyme between words of the same grammatical category  e g  noun with noun  or between very common endings   ão   ar    rima rica  rich rhyme   rhyme between words of different grammatical classes or with uncommon endings   rima preciosa  precious rhyme   rhyme between words with a different morphology  for example estrela  star  with vê la  to see her    rima esdrúxula  odd rhyme   rhyme between proparoxytonic words  example  última   last   and vítima   victim     4 10  Russian  Rhyme was introduced into Russian poetry in the 18th century  Folk poetry had generally been unrhymed  relying more on dactylic line endings for effect  Rhyme depends on a vowel and adjacent consonant  which may include the semivowel Short I   Vowel pairs rhyme   even though non Russian speakers may not perceive them as the same sound  Consonant pairs rhyme if both are devoiced  Early 18th century poetry demanded perfect rhymes which were also grammatical rhymes  namely that noun endings rhymed with noun endings  verb endings with verb endings  and so on  Such rhymes relying on morphological endings become much rarer in modern Russian poetry  and greater use is made of approximate rhymes   4 11  Sanskrit  Patterns of rich rhyme  prāsa  play a role in modern Sanskrit poetry  but only to a minor extent in historical Sanskrit texts  They are classified according to their position within the pada  metrical foot   ādiprāsa  first syllable   dvitīyākṣara prāsa  second syllable   antyaprāsa  final syllable  etc   4 12  Tamil  There are some unique rhyming schemes in Dravidian languages like Tamil  Specifically  the rhyme called etukai  anaphora  occurs on the second consonant of each line   The other rhyme and related patterns are called mōnai  alliteration   toṭai  epiphora  and iraṭṭai kiḷavi  parallelism    Some classical Tamil poetry forms  such as veṇpā  have rigid grammars for rhyme to the point that they could be expressed as a context free grammar   5  See also  Alliteration  Assonance  Glossary of poetry terms  An Introduction to Rhyme  List of
