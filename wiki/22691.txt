Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  OFDM  is a method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies  OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital communication  used in applications such as digital television and audio broadcasting  DSL Internet access  wireless networks  powerline networks  and 4G mobile communications   OFDM is a frequency division multiplexing  FDM  scheme used as a digital multi carrier modulation method  A large number of closely spaced orthogonal sub carrier signals are used to carry data on several parallel data streams or channels  Each sub carrier is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme  such as quadrature amplitude modulation or phase shift keying  at a low symbol rate  maintaining total data rates similar to conventional single carrier modulation schemes in the same bandwidth   The primary advantage of OFDM over single carrier schemes is its ability to cope with severe channel conditions  for example  attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper wire  narrowband interference and frequency selective fading due to multipath  without complex equalization filters  Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal  The low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable  making it possible to eliminate intersymbol interference  ISI  and utilize echoes and time spreading  on analogue TV these are visible as ghosting and blurring  respectively  to achieve a diversity gain  i e  a signal to noise ratio improvement  This mechanism also facilitates the design of single frequency networks  SFNs   where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency  as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be combined constructively  rather than interfering as would typically occur in a traditional single carrier system   1  Example of applications  The following list is a summary of existing OFDM based standards and products  For further details  see the Usage section at the end of the article   1 1  Cable

circuitry  which suffers from poor power efficiency   Loss of efficiency caused by cyclic prefix guard interval   3  Characteristics and principles of operation  3 1  Orthogonality  Conceptually  OFDM is a specialized FDM  the additional constraint being  all the carrier signals are orthogonal to each other   In OFDM  the sub carrier frequencies are chosen so that the sub carriers are orthogonal to each other  meaning that cross talk between the sub channels is eliminated and inter carrier guard bands are not required  This greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver  unlike conventional FDM  a separate filter for each sub channel is not required   The orthogonality requires that the sub carrier spacing is Hertz  where TU seconds is the useful symbol duration  the receiver side window size   and k is a positive integer  typically equal to 1  Therefore  with N sub carriers  the total passband bandwidth will be B ≈ N·Δf  Hz    The orthogonality also allows high spectral efficiency  with a total symbol rate near the Nyquist rate for the equivalent baseband signal  i e  near half the Nyquist rate for the double side band physical passband signal   Almost the whole available frequency band can be utilized  OFDM generally has a nearly  white  spectrum  giving it benign electromagnetic interference properties with respect to other co channel users   OFDM requires very accurate frequency synchronization between the receiver and the transmitter  with frequency deviation the sub carriers will no longer be orthogonal  causing inter carrier interference  ICI   i e   cross talk between the sub carriers   Frequency offsets are typically caused by mismatched transmitter and receiver oscillators  or by Doppler shift due to movement  While Doppler shift alone may be compensated for by the receiver  the situation is worsened when combined with multipath  as reflections will appear at various frequency offsets  which is much harder to correct  This effect typically worsens as speed increases  and is an important factor limiting the use of OFDM in high speed vehicles  In order to mitigate ICI in such scenarios  one can shape each sub carrier in order to minimize the interference resulting in a non orthogonal subcarriers overlapping  For example  a low complexity scheme referred to as WCP OFDM    consists in using short filters at the transmitter output in order to perform a potentially non rectangular pulse shaping and a near perfect reconstruction using a single tap per subcarrier equalization  Other ICI suppression techniques usually increase drastically the receiver complexity   3 2  Implementation using the FFT algorithm  The orthogonality allows for efficient modulator and demodulator implementation using the FFT algorithm on the receiver side  and inverse FFT on the sender side  Although the principles and some of the benefits have been known since the 1960s  OFDM is popular for wideband communications today by way of low cost digital signal processing components that can efficiently calculate the FFT   The time to compute the inverse FFT or FFT transform has to take less than the time for each symbol  Which for example for DVB T means the computation has to be done in or less   For an  point FFT this may be approximated to   MIPS   Million instructions per second The computational demand approximately scales linearly with FFT size so a double size FFT needs double the amount of time and vice versa  As a comparison an Intel Pentium III CPU at 1 266 GHz is able to calculate a FFT in using FFTW  Intel Pentium M at 1 6 GHz does it in Intel Core Duo at 3 0 GHz does it in    3 3  Guard interval for elimination of intersymbol interference  One key principle of OFDM is that since low symbol rate modulation schemes  i e   where the symbols are relatively long compared to the channel time characteristics  suffer less from intersymbol interference caused by multipath propagation  it is advantageous to transmit a number of low rate streams in parallel instead of a single high rate stream  Since the duration of each symbol is long  it is feasible to insert a guard interval between the OFDM symbols  thus eliminating the intersymbol interference   The guard interval also eliminates the need for a pulse shaping filter  and it reduces the sensitivity to time synchronization problems   The cyclic prefix  which is transmitted during the guard interval  consists of the end of the OFDM symbol copied into the guard interval  and the guard interval is transmitted followed by the OFDM symbol  The reason that the guard interval consists of a copy of the end of the OFDM symbol is so that the receiver will integrate over an integer number of sinusoid cycles for each of the multipaths when it performs OFDM demodulation with the FFT  In some standards such as Ultrawideband  in the interest of transmitted power  cyclic prefix is skipped and nothing is sent during the guard interval  The receiver will then have to mimic the cyclic prefix functionality by copying the end part of the OFDM symbol and adding it to the beginning portion   3 4  Simplified equalization  The effects of frequency selective channel conditions  for example fading caused by multipath propagation  can be considered as constant  flat  over an OFDM sub channel if the sub channel is sufficiently narrow banded  i e   if the number of sub channels is sufficiently large   This makes frequency domain equalization possible at the receiver  which is far simpler than the time domain equalization used in conventional single carrier modulation  In OFDM  the equalizer only has to multiply each detected sub carrier  each Fourier coefficient  in each OFDM symbol by a constant complex number  or a rarely changed value   If differential modulation such as DPSK or DQPSK is applied to each sub carrier  equalization can be completely omitted  since these non coherent schemes are insensitive to slowly changing amplitude and phase distortion   In a sense  improvements in FIR equalization using FFTs or partial FFTs leads mathematically closer to OFDM  but the OFDM technique is easier to understand and implement  and the sub channels can be independently adapted in other ways than varying equalization coefficients  such as switching between different QAM constellation patterns and error correction schemes to match individual sub channel noise and interference characteristics   Some of the sub carriers in some of the OFDM symbols may carry pilot signals for measurement of the channel conditions  i e   the equalizer gain and phase shift for each sub carrier   Pilot signals and training symbols  preambles  may also be used for time synchronization  to avoid intersymbol interference  ISI  and frequency synchronization  to avoid inter carrier interference  ICI  caused by Doppler shift    OFDM was initially used for wired and stationary wireless communications  However  with an increasing number of applications operating in highly mobile environments  the effect of dispersive fading caused by a combination of multi path propagation and doppler shift is more significant  Over the last decade  research has been done on how to equalize OFDM transmission over doubly selective channels   3 5  Channel coding and interleaving  OFDM is invariably used in conjunction with channel coding  forward error correction   and almost always uses frequency and or time interleaving   Frequency  subcarrier  interleaving increases resistance to frequency selective channel conditions such as fading  For example  when a part of the channel bandwidth fades  frequency interleaving ensures that the bit errors that would result from those subcarriers in the faded part of the bandwidth are spread out in the bit stream rather than being concentrated  Similarly  time interleaving ensures that bits that are originally close together in the bit stream are transmitted far apart in time  thus mitigating against severe fading as would happen when travelling at high speed   However  time interleaving is of little benefit in slowly fading channels  such as for stationary reception  and frequency interleaving offers little to no benefit for narrowband channels that suffer from flat fading  where the whole channel bandwidth fades at the same time    The reason why interleaving is used on OFDM is to attempt to spread the errors out in the bit stream that is presented to the error correction decoder  because when such decoders are presented with a high concentration of errors the decoder is unable to correct all the bit errors  and a burst of uncorrected errors occurs  A similar design of audio data encoding makes compact disc  CD  playback robust   A classical type of error correction coding used with OFDM based systems is convolutional coding  often concatenated with Reed Solomon coding  Usually  additional interleaving  on top of the time and frequency interleaving mentioned above  in between the two layers of coding is implemented  The choice for Reed Solomon coding as the outer error correction code is based on the observation that the Viterbi decoder used for inner convolutional decoding produces short errors bursts when there is a high concentration of errors  and Reed Solomon codes are inherently well suited to correcting bursts of errors   Newer systems  however  usually now adopt near optimal types of error correction codes that use the turbo decoding principle  where the decoder iterates towards the desired solution  Examples of such error correction coding types include turbo codes and LDPC codes  which perform close to the Shannon limit for the Additive White Gaussian Noise  AWGN  channel  Some systems that have implemented these codes have concatenated them with either Reed Solomon  for example on the MediaFLO system  or BCH codes  on the DVB S2 system  to improve upon an error floor inherent to these codes at high signal to noise ratios   3 6  Adaptive transmission  The resilience to severe channel conditions can be further enhanced if information about the channel is sent over a return channel  Based on this feedback information  adaptive modulation  channel coding and power allocation may be applied across all sub carriers  or individually to each sub carrier  In the latter case  if a particular range of frequencies suffers from interference or attenuation  the carriers within that range can be disabled or made to run slower by applying more robust modulation or error coding to those sub carriers   The term discrete multitone modulation  DMT  denotes OFDM based communication systems that adapt the transmission to the channel conditions individually for each sub carrier  by means of so called bit loading  Examples are ADSL and VDSL   The upstream and downstream speeds can be varied by allocating either more or fewer carriers for each purpose  Some forms of rate adaptive DSL use this feature in real time  so that the bitrate is adapted to the co channel interference and bandwidth is allocated to whichever subscriber needs it most   3 7  OFDM extended with multiple access  OFDM in its primary form is considered as a digital modulation technique  and not a multi user channel access method  since it is utilized for transferring one bit stream over one communication channel using one sequence of OFDM symbols  However  OFDM can be combined with multiple access using time  frequency or coding separation of the users   In orthogonal frequency division multiple access  OFDMA   frequency division multiple access is achieved by assigning different OFDM sub channels to different users  OFDMA supports differentiated quality of service by assigning different number of sub carriers to different users in a similar fashion as in CDMA  and thus complex packet scheduling or Media Access Control schemes can be avoided  OFDMA is used in   the mobility mode of the IEEE 802 16 Wireless MAN standard  commonly referred to as WiMAX   the IEEE 802 20 mobile Wireless MAN standard  commonly referred to as MBWA   the 3GPP Long Term Evolution  LTE  fourth generation mobile broadband standard downlink  The radio interface was formerly named High Speed OFDM Packet Access  HSOPA   now named Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access  E UTRA    the now defunct Qualcomm 3GPP2 Ultra Mobile Broadband  UMB  project  intended as a successor of CDMA2000  but replaced by LTE  OFDMA is also a candidate access method for the IEEE 802 22 Wireless Regional Area Networks  WRAN   The project aims at designing the first cognitive radio based standard operating in the VHF low UHF spectrum  TV spectrum    In Multi carrier code division multiple access  MC CDMA   also known as OFDM CDMA  OFDM is combined with CDMA spread spectrum communication for coding separation of the users  Co channel interference can be mitigated  meaning that manual fixed channel allocation  FCA  frequency planning is simplified  or complex dynamic channel allocation  DCA  schemes are avoided   3 8  Space diversity  In OFDM based wide area broadcasting  receivers can benefit from receiving signals from several spatially dispersed transmitters simultaneously  since transmitters will only destructively interfere with each other on a limited number of sub carriers  whereas in general they will actually reinforce coverage over a wide area  This is very beneficial in many countries  as it permits the operation of national single frequency networks  SFN   where many transmitters send the same signal simultaneously over the same channel frequency  SFNs utilise the available spectrum more effectively than conventional multi frequency broadcast networks  MFN   where program content is replicated on different carrier frequencies  SFNs also result in a diversity gain in receivers situated midway between the transmitters  The coverage area is increased and the outage probability decreased in comparison to an MFN  due to increased received signal strength averaged over all sub carriers   Although the guard interval only contains redundant data  which means that it reduces the capacity  some OFDM based systems  such as some of the broadcasting systems  deliberately use a long guard interval in order to allow the transmitters to be spaced farther apart in an SFN  and longer guard intervals allow larger SFN cell sizes  A rule of thumb for the maximum distance between transmitters in an SFN is equal to the distance a signal travels during the guard interval 舒 for instance  a guard interval of 200 microseconds would allow transmitters to be spaced 60 km apart   A single frequency network is a form of transmitter macrodiversity  The concept can be further utilized in dynamic single frequency networks  DSFN   where the SFN grouping is changed from timeslot to timeslot   OFDM may be combined with other forms of space diversity  for example antenna arrays and MIMO channels  This is done in the IEEE802 11 Wireless LAN standard   3 9  Linear transmitter power amplifier  An OFDM signal exhibits a high peak to average power ratio  PAPR  because the independent phases of the sub carriers mean that they will often combine constructively  Handling this high PAPR requires   a high resolution digital to analogue converter  DAC  in the transmitter  a high resolution analogue to digital converter  ADC  in the receiver  a linear signal chain  Any non linearity in the signal chain will cause intermodulation distortion that  raises the noise floor  may cause inter carrier interference  generates out of band spurious radiation  The linearity requirement is demanding  especially for transmitter RF output circuitry where amplifiers are often designed to be non linear in order to minimise power consumption  In practical OFDM systems a small amount of peak clipping is allowed to limit the PAPR in a judicious trade off against the above consequences  However  the transmitter output filter which is required to reduce out of band spurs to legal levels has the effect of restoring peak levels that were clipped  so clipping is not an effective way to reduce PAPR   Although the spectral efficiency of OFDM is attractive for both terrestrial and space communications  the high PAPR requirements have so far limited OFDM applications to terrestrial systems   The crest factor CF  in dB  for an OFDM system with n uncorrelated sub carriers is  where CFc is the crest factor  in dB  for each sub carrier   CFc is 3 01 dB for the sine waves used for BPSK and QPSK modulation    For example  the DVB T signal in 2K mode is composed of 1705 sub carriers that are each QPSK modulated  giving a crest factor of 35 32 dB   Many crest factor reduction techniques have been developed   The dynamic range required for an FM receiver is while DAB only require about As a comparison  each extra bit per sample increases the dynamic range with  4  Efficiency comparison between single carrier and multicarrier  The performance of any communication system can be measured in terms of its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency  The power efficiency describes the ability of communication system to preserve bit error rate  BER  of the transmitted signal at low power levels  Bandwidth efficiency reflects how efficiently the allocated bandwidth is utilized and is defined as the throughput data rate per Hertz in a given bandwidth  If the large number of subcarriers are used  the bandwidth efficiency of multicarrier system such as OFDM with using optical fiber channel is defined as  Factor 2 is because of two polarization states in the fiber   where is the symbol rate in giga symbol per second  Gsps   and is the bandwidth of OFDM signal   There is saving of bandwidth by using Multicarrier modulation with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing   So the bandwidth for multicarrier system is less in comparison with single carrier system and hence bandwidth efficiency of multicarrier system is larger than single carrier system   There is only 1 dBm increase in receiver power  but we get 76 7% improvement in bandwidth efficiency with using multicarrier transmission technique   5  Idealized system model  This section describes a simple idealized OFDM system model suitable for a time invariant AWGN channel   5 1  Transmitter  An OFDM carrier signal is the sum of a number of orthogonal sub carriers  with baseband data on each sub carrier being independently modulated commonly using some type of quadrature amplitude modulation  QAM  or phase shift keying  PSK   This composite baseband signal is typically used to modulate a main RF carrier   is a serial stream of binary digits  By inverse multiplexing  these are first demultiplexed into parallel streams  and each one mapped to a  possibly complex  symbol stream using some modulation constellation  QAM  PSK  etc    Note that the constellations may be different  so some streams may carry a higher bit rate than others   An inverse FFT is computed on each set of symbols  giving a set of complex time domain samples  These samples are then quadrature mixed to passband in the standard way  The real and imaginary components are first converted to the analogue domain using digital to analogue converters  DACs   the analogue signals are then used to modulate cosine and sine waves at the carrier frequency    respectively  These signals are then summed to give the transmission signal     5 2  Receiver  The receiver picks up the signal   which is then quadrature mixed down to baseband using cosine and sine waves at the carrier frequency  This also creates signals centered on   so low pass filters are used to reject these  The baseband signals are then sampled and digitised using analog to digital converters  ADCs   and a forward FFT is used to convert back to the frequency domain   This returns parallel streams  each of which is converted to a binary stream using an appropriate symbol detector  These streams are then re combined into a serial stream    which is an estimate of the original binary stream at the transmitter   6  Mathematical description  If sub carriers are used  and each sub carrier is modulated using alternative symbols  the OFDM symbol alphabet consists of combined symbols   The low pass equivalent OFDM signal is expressed as   where are the data symbols  is the number of sub carriers  and is the OFDM symbol time  The sub carrier spacing of makes them orthogonal over each symbol period  this property is expressed as   where denotes the complex conjugate operator and is the Kronecker delta   To avoid intersymbol interference in multipath fading channels  a guard interval of length is inserted prior to the OFDM block  During this interval  a cyclic prefix is transmitted such that the signal in the interval equals the signal in the interval   The OFDM signal with cyclic prefix is thus   The low pass signal above can be either real or complex valued  Real valued low pass equivalent signals are typically transmitted at baseband—wireline applications such as DSL use this approach  For wireless applications  the low pass signal is typically complex valued  in which case  the transmitted signal is up converted to a carrier frequency   In general  the transmitted signal can be represented as

comparison table  Key features of some common OFDM based systems are presented in the following table   7 2  ADSL  OFDM is used in ADSL connections that follow the ANSI T1 413 and G dmt  ITU G 992 1  standards  where it is called discrete multitone modulation  DMT   DSL achieves high speed data connections on existing copper wires  OFDM is also used in the successor standards ADSL2  ADSL2+  VDSL  VDSL2  and G fast  ADSL2 uses variable sub carrier modulation  ranging from BPSK to 32768QAM  in ADSL terminology this is referred to as bit loading  or bit per tone  1 to 15 bits per sub carrier    Long copper wires suffer from attenuation at high frequencies  The fact that OFDM can cope with this frequency selective attenuation and with narrow band interference are the main reasons it is frequently used in applications such as ADSL modems  However  DSL cannot be used on every copper pair  interference may become significant if more than 25% of phone lines coming into a central office are used for DSL   7 3  Powerline Technology  OFDM is used by many powerline devices to extend digital connections through power wiring  Adaptive modulation is particularly important with such a noisy channel as electrical wiring  Some medium speed smart metering modems   Prime  and  G3  use OFDM at modest frequencies  30–100 kHz with modest numbers of channels  several hundred  in order to overcome the intersymbol interference in the power line environment  The IEEE 1901 standards include two incompatible physical layers that both use OFDM  The ITU T G hn standard  which provides high speed local area networking over existing home wiring  power lines  phone lines and coaxial cables  is based on a PHY layer that specifies OFDM with adaptive modulation and a Low Density Parity Check  LDPC  FEC code   7 4  Wireless local area networks  LAN  and metropolitan area networks  MAN   OFDM is extensively used in wireless LAN and MAN applications  including IEEE 802 11a g n and WiMAX   IEEE 802 11a g n operating in the 2 4 and 5 GHz bands  specifies a per stream airside data rates ranging from 6 to 54 Mbit s  If both devices can utilize  HT mode  added with 802 11n then the top 20 MHz per stream rate is increased to 72 2 Mbit s with the option of data rates between 13 5 and 150 Mbit s using a 40 MHz channel  Four different modulation schemes are used  BPSK  QPSK  16 QAM  and 64 QAM  along with a set of error correcting rates  1 2–5 6   The multitude of choices allows the system to adapt the optimum data rate for the current signal conditions   7 5  Wireless personal area networks  PAN   OFDM is also now being used in the for high speed wireless personal area networks in the 3 1–10 6 GHz ultrawideband spectrum  see MultiBand OFDM    7 6  Terrestrial digital radio and television broadcasting  Much of Europe and Asia has adopted OFDM for terrestrial broadcasting of digital television  DVB T  DVB H and T DMB  and radio  EUREKA 147 DAB  Digital Radio Mondiale  HD Radio and T DMB    7 6 1  DVB T  By Directive of the European Commission  all television services transmitted to viewers in the European Community must use a transmission system that has been standardized by a recognized European standardization body  and such a standard has been developed and codified by the DVB Project  Digital Video Broadcasting  DVB   Framing structure  channel coding and modulation for digital terrestrial television  Customarily referred to as DVB T  the standard calls for the exclusive use of COFDM for modulation  DVB T is now widely used in Europe and elsewhere for terrestrial digital TV   7 6 2  SDARS  The ground segments of the Digital Audio Radio Service  SDARS  systems used by XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio are transmitted using Coded OFDM  COFDM   The word  coded  comes from the use of forward error correction  FEC    7 6 3  COFDM vs VSB  The question of the relative technical merits of COFDM versus 8VSB for terrestrial digital television has been a subject of some controversy  especially between European and North American technologists and regulators  The United States has rejected several proposals to adopt the COFDM based DVB T system for its digital television services  and has instead opted for 8VSB  vestigial sideband modulation  operation   One of the major benefits provided by COFDM is in rendering radio broadcasts relatively immune to multipath distortion and signal fading due to atmospheric conditions or passing aircraft  Proponents of COFDM argue it resists multipath far better than 8VSB  Early 8VSB DTV  digital television  receivers often had difficulty receiving a signal  Also  COFDM allows single frequency networks  which is not possible with 8VSB   However  newer 8VSB receivers are far better at dealing with multipath  hence the difference in performance may diminish with advances in equalizer design  Moreover  8VSB is nearly a single sideband transmission scheme  while OFDM can be described as a double sideband modulation scheme  This implies that 8VSB  with 3 bit symbol  modulation offers similar bit rate and require similar bandwidth as 64QAM OFDM  with 6 bit per symbol and sub carrier   i e  similar spectral efficiency in  bit s  Hz  However  the small 8VSB alphabet of 8 symbols makes it less prone to noise than the 64QAM alphabet of 64 symbols  resulting in lower bit error rate for the same carrier to noise ratio in case of multipath propagation  8VSB requires less power than 64QAM to transmit a signal the same distance  i e   the received carrier to noise threshold is lower for the same bit error rate    7 6 4  Digital radio  COFDM is also used for other radio standards  for Digital Audio Broadcasting  DAB   the standard for digital audio broadcasting at VHF frequencies  for Digital Radio Mondiale  DRM   the standard for digital broadcasting at shortwave and medium wave frequencies  below 30 MHz  and for DRM+ a more recently introduced standard for digital audio broadcasting at VHF frequencies   30 to 174 MHz   The USA again uses an alternate standard  a proprietary system developed by iBiquity dubbed HD Radio  However  it uses COFDM as the underlying broadcast technology to add digital audio to AM  medium wave  and FM broadcasts   Both Digital Radio Mondiale and HD Radio are classified as in band on channel systems  unlike Eureka 147  DAB  Digital Audio Broadcasting  which uses separate VHF or UHF frequency bands instead   7 6 5  BST OFDM used in ISDB  The band segmented transmission orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  BST OFDM  system proposed for Japan  in the ISDB T  ISDB TSB  and ISDB C broadcasting systems  improves upon COFDM by exploiting the fact that some OFDM carriers may be modulated differently from others within the same multiplex  Some forms of COFDM already offer this kind of hierarchical modulation  though BST OFDM is intended to make it more flexible  The 6 MHz television channel may therefore be  segmented   with different segments being modulated differently and used for different services   It is possible  for example  to send an audio service on a segment that includes a segment composed of a number of carriers  a data service on another segment and a television service on yet another segment—all within the same 6 MHz television channel  Furthermore  these may be modulated with different parameters so that  for example  the audio and data services could be optimized for mobile reception  while the television service is optimized for stationary reception in a high multipath environment   7 7  Ultra wideband  Ultra wideband  UWB  wireless personal area network technology may also utilise OFDM  such as in Multiband OFDM  MB OFDM   This UWB specification is advocated by the WiMedia Alliance  formerly by both the Multiband OFDM Alliance  MBOA  and the WiMedia Alliance  but the two have now merged   and is one of the competing UWB radio interfaces   7 8  FLASH OFDM  Fast low latency access with seamless handoff orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  Flash OFDM   also referred to as F OFDM  was based on OFDM and also specified higher protocol layers  It was developed by Flarion  and purchased by Qualcomm in January 2006  Flash OFDM was marketed as a packet switched cellular bearer  to compete with GSM and 3G networks  As an example  450 MHz frequency bands previously used by NMT 450 and C Net C450  both 1G analogue networks  now mostly decommissioned  in Europe are being licensed to Flash OFDM operators   In Finland  the license holder Digita began deployment of a nationwide  @450  wireless network in parts of the country since April 2007  It was purchased by Datame in 2011  In February 2012 Datame announced they would upgrade the 450 MHz network to competing CDMA2000 technology   Slovak Telekom in Slovakia offers Flash OFDM connections with a maximum downstream speed of 5 3 Mbit s  and a maximum upstream speed of 1 8 Mbit s  with a coverage of over 70 percent of Slovak population   T Mobile Germany uses Flash OFDM to backhaul Wi Fi HotSpots on the Deutsche Bahn s ICE high speed trains   American wireless carrier Nextel

parts of Virginia in March 2006  The maximum speed available was 1 5 Mbit s  The service was discontinued on April 30  2009   Digiweb Ltd  launched a mobile broadband network using Flash OFDM technology at 872 MHz in July 2007 in Ireland and Digiweb also owns a national 872 MHz license in Norway  Voice handsets are not yet available as of November 2007  The deployment is live in a small
