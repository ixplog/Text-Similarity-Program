Netscape Communications  formerly known as Netscape Communications Corporation and commonly known as Netscape  is a U S  computer services company  best known for Netscape Navigator  its web browser  When it was an independent company  its headquarters was in Mountain View  California   Netscape s web browser was once dominant in terms of usage share  but lost most of that share to Internet Explorer during the so called first browser war  The usage share of Netscape had fallen from over 90 percent in the mid 1990s to less than one percent by the end of 2006   Netscape is credited with developing the Secure Sockets Layer Protocol  SSL  for securing online communication  which is still widely used  as well as JavaScript  the most widely used language for client side scripting of web pages   Netscape stock traded from 1995 until 1999 when it was acquired by AOL in a pooling of interests transaction ultimately worth US$10 billion  Shortly before its acquisition by AOL  Netscape released the source code for its browser and created the Mozilla Organization to coordinate future development of its product  The Mozilla Organization rewrote the entire browser s source code based on the Gecko rendering engine  all future Netscape releases were based on this rewritten code  The Gecko engine would later be used to power the Mozilla Foundation s Firefox browser   Under AOL  Netscape s browser development continued until December 2007  when AOL announced that the company would stop supporting the Netscape browser as of early 2008  AOL has continued to use the Netscape brand in recent years to market a discount Internet service provider   1  History  1 1  Early years  Netscape was the first company to attempt to capitalize on the nascent World Wide Web  It was originally founded under the name Mosaic Communications Corporation on April 4  1994  the brainchild of Jim Clark who had recruited Marc Andreessen as co founder and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as investors  Clark recruited other early team members from SGI and NCSA Mosaic  Jim Barksdale came on board as CEO in January 1995  Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen originally created a 20 page concept pitch for an online gaming network to Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 console  but a deal was never reached  Marc Andreessen explains   If they had shipped a year earlier  we probably would have done that instead of Netscape    The company s first product was the web browser  called Mosaic Netscape 0 9  released on October 13  1994  This browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator  and the company took the  Netscape  name  coined by employee Greg Sands  although it was also a trademark of Cisco Systems  on November 14  1994 to avoid trademark ownership problems with NCSA  where the initial Netscape employees had previously created the NCSA Mosaic web browser  The Mosaic Netscape web browser did not use any NCSA Mosaic code  The internal codename for the company s browser was Mozilla  which stood for  Mosaic killer   as the company s goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the world s number one web browser  A cartoon Godzilla like lizard mascot was drawn by artist employee Dave Titus  which went well with the theme of crushing the competition  The Mozilla mascot featured prominently on Netscape s web site in the company s early years  The desire to project a more  professional  image  especially towards corporate clients  led to his being removed  On August 9  1995  Netscape made an extremely successful IPO  The stock was set to be offered at US$14 per share  but a last minute decision doubled the initial offering to US$28 per share  The stock s value soared to US$75 during the first day of trading  nearly a record for first day gain  The stock closed at US$58 25  which gave Netscape a market value of US$2 9 billion  While it was unusual for a company to go public prior to becoming profitable  Netscape s revenues had  in fact  doubled every quarter in 1995  The success of this IPO subsequently inspired the use of the term  Netscape moment  to describe a high visibility IPO that signals the dawn of a new industry  During this period  Netscape also pursued a publicity strategy  crafted by Rosanne Siino  then head of public relations  packaging Andreessen as the company s  rock star   The events of this period ultimately landed Andreessen  barefoot  on the cover of Time Magazine   Netscape advertised that  the web is for everyone  and stated one of its goals was to  level the playing field  among operating systems by providing a consistent web browsing experience across them  The Netscape web browser interface was identical on any computer  Netscape later experimented with prototypes of a web based system which would enable users to access and edit their files anywhere across a network  no matter what computer or operating system they happened to be using  This did not escape the attention of Microsoft  which viewed the commoditization of operating systems as a direct threat to its bottom line  i e  a move from Windows to another operating system would yield a similar browsing experience thus reducing barriers to change  It is alleged that several Microsoft executives visited the Netscape campus in June 1995 to propose dividing the market  an allegation denied by Microsoft and  if true  would have breached antitrust laws   which would have allowed Microsoft to produce web browser software for Windows while leaving all other operating systems to Netscape  Netscape refused the proposition   Microsoft released version 1 0 of Internet Explorer as a part of the Windows 95 Plus Pack add on  According to former Spyglass developer Eric Sink  Internet Explorer was based not on NCSA Mosaic as commonly believed  but on a version of Mosaic developed at Spyglass  which itself was based upon NCSA Mosaic   Microsoft quickly released several successive versions of Internet Explorer  bundling them with Windows  never charging for them  financing their development and marketing with revenues from other areas of the company  This period of time became known as the browser wars  in which Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer added many new features and went through many version numbers  not always in a logical fashion  in attempts to outdo each other  But Internet Explorer had the upper hand  as the amount of manpower and capital dedicated to it eventually surpassed the resources available in Netscape s entire business  By version 3 0  IE was roughly a feature for feature equivalent of Netscape Communicator  and by version 4 0  it was generally considered to be more stable on Windows than on the Macintosh platform  Microsoft also targeted other Netscape products with free workalikes  such as the Internet Information Server  IIS   a web server which was bundled with Windows NT   Netscape could not compete with this strategy  In fact  it didn t attempt to  Netscape Navigator was not free to the general public until January 1998  while Internet Explorer and IIS have always been free or came bundled with an operating system and or other applications  Meanwhile  Netscape faced increasing criticism for the bugs in its products  critics claimed that the company suffered from  featuritis  â€“ putting a higher priority on adding new features than on making them work properly  This was particularly true with Netscape Navigator 2  which was only on the market for 5 months in early 1996 before being replaced by Netscape Navigator 3  The tide of public opinion  having once lauded Netscape as the David to Microsoft s Goliath  steadily turned negative  especially when Netscape experienced its first bad quarter at the end of 1997 and underwent a large round of lay offs in January 1998  Later  former Netscape executives Mike Homer and Peter Currie described the period as  hectic and crazy  and that the company was undone by factors both internal and external   1 2  Open sourcing  January 1998 was also the month that Netscape started the open source Mozilla project  Netscape publicly released the source code of Netscape Communicator 4 0 in the hopes that it would become a popular open source project  It placed this code under the Netscape Public License  which was similar to the GNU General Public License but allowed Netscape to continue to publish proprietary work containing the publicly released code  After having released the Communicator 4 0 code this way  Netscape proceeded to work on Communicator 4 5 which was focused on improving email and enterprise functionality  It eventually became clear that the Communicator 4 0 browser was too difficult to develop  and open source development was halted on this codebase  Instead  the open source development shifted to a next generation browser built from scratch  Using the newly built Gecko layout engine  this browser had a much more modular architecture than Communicator 4 0 and was therefore easier to develop with a large number of programmers  It also included an XML user interface language named XUL that allowed single development of a user interface that ran on Windows  Macintosh  and Unix  The slogan for this open sourcing effort   Free The Lizard   carried comedic sexual overtones   The United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust case against Microsoft in May 1998  Netscape was not a plaintiff in the case  though its executives were subpoenaed and it contributed much material to the case  including the entire contents of the  Bad Attitude  internal discussion forum  In October 1998  Netscape acquired web directory site NewHoo for the sum of US$1 million  renamed it the Open Directory Project  and released its database under an open content license   1 3  Acquisition by America Online  America Online  AOL  on November 24  1998 announced it would acquire Netscape Communications in a tax free stock swap valued at US$4 2 billion at the time of the announcement  By the time the deal closed on March 17  1999  it was valued at US$10 billion  This merger was ridiculed by many who believed that the two corporate cultures could not possibly mesh  one of its most prominent critics was longtime Netscape developer Jamie Zawinski  The acquisition was seen as a way for AOL to gain a bargaining chip against Microsoft  to let it become less dependent on the Internet Explorer web browser  Others believed that AOL was interested in Netcenter  or Netscape s web properties  which drew some of the highest traffic worldwide  Eventually  Netscape s server products and its Professional Services group became part of iPlanet  a joint marketing and development alliance between AOL and Sun Microsystems  On November 14  2000  AOL released Netscape 6  based on the Mozilla 0 6 source code   Version 5 was skipped   Unfortunately  Mozilla 0 6 was far from being stable yet  and so the effect of Netscape 6 was to further drive people away from the Netscape brand  It was not until August 2001 that Netscape 6 1 appeared  based on Mozilla 0 9 2 which was significantly more robust  A year later came Netscape 7 0  based on the Mozilla 1 0 core   1 4  Disbanding  During the acquisition of Netscape by AOL  joint development and marketing of Netscape software products would occur through the Sun Netscape Alliance  The software in the newly branded iPlanet included  messaging and calendar  collaboration  web  application  directory  and certificate servers   as well as  production ready applications for e commerce  including commerce exchange  procurement  selling  and billing   In March 2002  when the alliance was ended   iPlanet became a division of Sun    Sun retained the intellectual property rights for all products and the engineering   On July 15  2003  Time Warner  formerly AOL Time Warner  disbanded Netscape  Most of the programmers were laid off  and the Netscape logo was removed from the building  However  the Netscape 7 2 web browser  developed in house rather than with Netscape staff  with some work outsourced to Sun s Beijing development center  was released by AOL on August 18  2004   On October 12  2004  the popular developer website Netscape DevEdge was shut down by AOL  DevEdge was an important resource for Internet related technologies  maintaining definitive documentation on the Netscape browser  documentation on associated technologies like HTML and JavaScript  and popular articles written by industry and technology leaders such as Danny Goodman  Some content from DevEdge has been republished at the Mozilla website   After the Sun acquisition by Oracle in January 2010  Oracle continued to sell iPlanet branded applications  which originated from Netscape  Applications include  Oracle iPlanet Web Server and Oracle iPlanet Web Proxy Server   1 5  Final release of the browser  The Netscape brand name continued to be used extensively  The company once again had its own programming staff devoted to the development and support for the series of web browsers  Additionally  Netscape also maintained the Propeller web portal  which was a popular social news site  similar to Digg  which was given a new look in June 2006  AOL marketed a discount ISP service under the Netscape brand name   A new version of the Netscape browser  Netscape Navigator 9  based on Firefox 2  was released in October 2007  It featured a green and grey interface  In November 2007  IE had 77 4% of the browser market  Firefox 16 0% and Netscape 0 6%  according to Net Applications  an Internet metrics firm  On December 28  2007  AOL announced that on February 1  2008 it would drop support for the Netscape web browser and would no longer develop new releases  The date was later extended to March 1 to allow a major security update and to add a tool to assist users in migrating to other browsers  These additional features were included in the final version of Netscape Navigator 9  version 9 0 0 6   released on February 20  2008   2  Software  2 1  Classic releases  2 1 1  Netscape Navigator  versions 0 9â€“4 08   Netscape Navigator was Netscape s web browser from versions 1 0â€“4 8  The first beta versions were released in 1994 and were called Mosaic and later Mosaic Netscape  Then  a legal challenge from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications  makers of NCSA Mosaic   which many of Netscape s founders used to develop  led to the name Netscape Navigator  The company s name also changed from Mosaic Communications Corporation to Netscape Communications Corporation   The browser was easily the most advanced available and so was an instant success  becoming market leader while still in beta  Netscape s feature count and market share continued to grow rapidly after version 1 0 was released  Version 2 0 added a full email reader called Netscape Mail  thus transforming Netscape from a single purpose web browser to an Internet suite  The main distinguishing feature of the email client was its ability to display HTML email  During this period  the entire suite was called Netscape Navigator   Version 3 0 of Netscape  the first beta was codenamed  Atlas   was the first to face any serious competition in the form of Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 0  But Netscape easily remained the number one browser for the time being   Netscape also released a Gold version of Navigator 3 0 that incorporated WYSIWYG editing with drag and drop between web editor and email components   2 1 2  Netscape Communicator  versions 4 0â€“4 8   Netscape 4 addressed the problem of Netscape Navigator being used as both the name of the suite and the browser contained within it by renaming the suite to Netscape Communicator  After five preview releases in 1996â€“1997  Netscape released the final version of Netscape Communicator in June 1997  This version  more or less based on Netscape Navigator 3 Code  updated and added new features  The new suite was successful  despite increasing competition from Internet Explorer  IE  4 0  which had a more advanced HTML engine  and problems with the outdated browser core  IE was slow and unstable on the Mac platform until version 4 5  Despite this  Apple entered into an agreement with Microsoft to make IE the default browser on new Mac OS installations  a further blow to Netscape s prestige  The Communicator suite was made up of Netscape Navigator  Netscape Mail & Newsgroups  Netscape Address Book and Netscape Composer  an HTML editor    In January 1998  Netscape Communications Corporation announced that all future versions of its software would be available free of charge and developed by an open source community  Mozilla  Netscape Communicator 5 0 was announced  codenamed  Gromit    However  its release was greatly delayed  and meanwhile there were newer versions of Internet Explorer  starting with version 4  These had more features than the old Netscape version  including better support of HTML 4  CSS  DOM  and ECMAScript  The more advanced Internet Explorer 5 0 became the market leader   In October 1998  Netscape Communicator 4 5 was released  It featured various functionality improvements  especially in the Mail and Newsgroups component  but did not update the browser core  whose functionality was essentially identical to that of version 4 08  One month later  Netscape Communications Corporation was bought by AOL  In November  work on Netscape 5 0 was canceled in favor of developing a completely new program from scratch   2 2  Mozilla based releases  2 2 1  Netscape 6  versions 6 0â€“6 2 3   In 1998  an informal group called the Mozilla Organization was formed and largely funded by Netscape  the vast majority of programmers working on the code were paid by Netscape  to co ordinate the development of Netscape 5  codenamed  Gromit    which would be based on the Communicator source code  The aging Communicator code proved difficult to work with and the decision was taken to scrap Netscape 5 and re write the source code  The re written source code was in the form of the Mozilla web browser  which  with a few additions  Netscape 6 was based on   This decision meant that Netscape s next major version was severely delayed  In the meantime  Netscape was taken over by AOL who  acting under pressure from the Web Standards Project  forced its new division to release Netscape 6 0 in 2000  The suite again consisted of Netscape Navigator and the other Communicator components  with the addition of a built in AOL Instant Messenger client  Netscape Instant Messenger  It was clear that Netscape 6 was not yet ready for release and it flopped badly  It was based on Mozilla 0 6  which was not ready to be used by the general public yet due to many serious bugs that would cause it to crash often or render web pages slowly  Later versions of Netscape 6 were much improved  especially 6 2 x was regarded as a good release   but the browser still struggled to make an impact on a disappointed community   2 2 2  Netscape 7  versions 7 0â€“7 2   Netscape 7 0  based on Mozilla 1 0 1  was released in August 2002 was a direct continuation of Netscape 6 with very similar components  It picked up a few users  but was still very much a minority browser  It came with the Radio@Netscape Internet radio client  AOL had decided to deactivate Mozilla s popup blocker functionality in Netscape 7 0  which created an outrage in the community  AOL learned the lesson for Netscape 7 01 and allowed Netscape to reinstate the popup blocker  Netscape also introduced a new AOL free version  without the usual AOL addons  of the browser suite  Netscape 7 1  codenamed  Buffy  and based on Mozilla 1 4  was released in June 2003   In 2003  AOL closed down its Netscape division and laid off or reassigned all of Netscape s employees  Mozilla org continued as the independent Mozilla Foundation  taking on many of Netscape s ex employees  AOL continued to develop Netscape in house  with help from Sun s Beijing development center   but  due to there being no staff committed to it  improvements were minimal  One year later  in August 2004  the last version based on Mozilla was released  Netscape 7 2  based on Mozilla 1 7 2   After an official poll posted on Netscape s community support board in late 2006  speculation arose of the Netscape 7 series of suites being fully supported and updated by Netscape s in house development team  This was not to be   2 3  Mozilla Firefox based releases  2 3 1  Netscape Browser  version 8 0â€“8 1 3   Between 2005 and 2007  Netscape s releases became known as Netscape Browser  AOL chose to base Netscape Browser on the relatively successful Mozilla Firefox  a re written version of Mozilla produced by the Mozilla Foundation  This release is not a full Internet suite as before  but is solely a web browser  Other controversial decisions include the browser s being made only for Microsoft Windows and its featuring both the Gecko rendering engine of previous releases and the Trident engine used in Internet Explorer  AOL s acquisition of Netscape Communications in November 1998 made it less of a surprise when the company laid off the Netscape team and outsourced development to Mercurial Communications  Netscape Browser 8 1 3 was released on April 2  2007  and included general bug fixes identified in versions 8 0â€“8 1 2  2 3 2  Netscape Navigator  version 9 0   Netscape Navigator 9 s features were said to include newsfeed support and become more integrated with the Propeller Internet portal  alongside more enhanced methods of discussion  submission and voting on web pages  It also sees the browser return to multi platform support across Windows  Linux and Mac OS X  Like Netscape version 8 x  the new release was based upon the popular Mozilla Firefox  version 2 0   and supposedly had full support of all Firefox add ons and plugins  some of which Netscape was already providing  Also for the first time since 2004  the browser was produced in house with its own programming staff  A beta of the program was first released on June 5  2007  The final version was released on October 15  2007   2 4  End of development and support  AOL officially announced that support for Netscape Navigator would end on March 1  2008  and recommended that its users download either the Flock or Firefox browsers  both of which were based on the same technology   The decision met mixed reactions from communities  with many arguing that the termination of product support is significantly belated  Internet security site Security Watch stated that a trend of infrequent security updates for AOL s Netscape caused the browser to become a  security liability   specifically the 2005â€“2007 versions  Netscape Browser 8  Asa Dotzler  one of Firefox s original bug testers  greeted the news with  good riddance  in his blog post  but praised the various members of the Netscape team over the years for enabling the creation of Mozilla in 1998  Others protested and petitioned AOL to continue providing vital security fixes to unknowing or loyal users of its software  as well as protection of a well known brand   2 5  Mozilla Thunderbird based releases  2 5 1  Netscape Messenger 9  On June 11  2007  Netscape announced Netscape Mercury  a stand alone Email   News Client that was to accompany Navigator 9  Mercury was based on Mozilla Thunderbird  The product was later renamed Netscape Messenger 9  and an alpha version was released  In December 2007  AOL announced it was canceling Netscape s development of Messenger 9 as well as Navigator 9   3  Product list  3 1  Initial product line  Netscape s initial product line consisted of   Netscape Navigator web browser for Windows  Macintosh  OS 2  Unix  and Linux  Netsite Communications web server  with a web based configuration interface  Netsite Commerce web server  simply the Communications server with SSL  https  added  Netscape Proxy Server  3 2  Later Netscape products  Netscape s later products included   Netscape Personal Edition  the browser along with PPP software and an account creation wizard to sign up with an ISP   Netscape Communicator  a suite which included Navigator along with tools for mail  news  calendar  VoIP  and composing web pages  and was bundled with AOL Instant Messenger and RealAudio   Netscape FastTrack and Enterprise web servers  Netscape Collabra Server  a NNTP news server acquired in a purchase of Collabra Software  Inc   Netscape Directory Server  an LDAP server  Netscape Messaging Server  an IMAP and POP mail

designing web applications  Netscape Publishing System  for running a commercial site with news articles and charging users per access  Netscape Xpert Servers  ECxpert â€“ a server for EDI message exchange  SellerXpert â€“ B to B Commerce Engine  BuyerXpert â€“ eProcurement Engine  BillerXpert â€“ Online Bill Paying Engine  TradingXpert â€“ HTML EDI transaction frontend  CommerceXpert â€“ Online Retail Store engine  Radio@Netscape and Radio@Netscape Plus  3 3  Propeller  Between June 2006 and September 2007  AOL operated Netscape s website as social news website similar to Digg  The format did not do well  traffic dropped 55 1 percent between November 2006 and August 2007  In September 2007  AOL reverted Netscape s website to a traditional news portal  and rebranded the social news portal as  Propeller   moving the site to the domain  propeller com   AOL shut down the Propeller website on October 1  2010   3 4  Netscape Search  Netscape operated a search engine  Netscape Search  which now redirects to AOL Search  which itself now merely serves Google search results   Another version of Netscape Search was incorporated into Propeller   3 5  Other sites  Netscape also operates a number of country specific Netscape portals  including among others  The portal of was shut down in June 2008   The Netscape Blog was written by Netscape employees discussing the latest on Netscape products and services  Netscape NewsQuake  formally Netscape Reports  is Netscape s news and opinion blog  including video clips and discussions  As of January 2012  no new posts have been made on either of these blogs since August 2008   3 6  Netscape technologies  Netscape created the JavaScript web page scripting language  It also pioneered the development of push technology  which effectively allowed web sites to send regular updates of information  weather  stock updates  package tracking  etc   directly to a user s desktop  aka  webtop    Netscape s implementation of this was named Netcaster  Unfortunately  businesses quickly recognized the use of push technology to deliver ads to users  and annoyed users turned off the feature  so Netcaster was short lived   Netscape was notable for its cross platform efforts  Its client software continued to be made available for Windows  3 1  95  98  NT   Macintosh  Linux  OS 2  BeOS  and many versions of Unix including DEC  Sun Solaris  BSDI  IRIX  IBM AIX  and HP UX  Its server software generally was only available for Unix and Windows NT  though some of its servers were made available on Linux  and a version of Netscape FastTrack Server was made available for Windows 95 98  Today  most of Netscape s server offerings live on as the Sun Java System  formerly under the Sun ONE branding  Although Netscape Browser 8 was Windows only  multi platform support exists in the Netscape Navigator 9 series of browsers   4  Current services  4 1  Netscape Internet Service  Netscape ISP is a 56 kbit s dial up service offered at US$9 95 per month  US$6 95 with 12 month commitment   The company serves webpages in a compressed format to increase effective speeds up to 1300 kbit s  average 500 kbit s   The Internet service provider is run by AOL under the Netscape brand  The low cost ISP was officially launched on January 8  2004  Its main competitor is NetZero  Netscape ISP s advertising is generally aimed at a younger demographic  e g   college students  and people just out of school  as an affordable way to gain access to the Internet   4 1 1  Web Accelerator  The Web Accelerator precompresses text at the Server side to approximately 4% its original size  increasing effective throughput to 1300 kbit s  The accelerator also precompresses Flash executables and images to approximately 30% and 10%  respectively  Netscape advertises this as  DSL speeds over regular phone lines   although such speeds are limited to only web browsing  not downloads of files   Another drawback of this approach is a loss in quality  where the graphics become heavily compacted and smeared  but the speed is dramatically improved such that web pages load in less than 5 seconds   4 2  Netscape com  Netscape always drove lots of traffic from various links included in the browser menus to its web properties  Some say it was very late to leverage this traffic for what would become the start of the major online portal wars  When it did  Netcenter  the new name for its site entered the race with Yahoo   Infoseek  and MSN  which Google would only join years later   The original Netscape com was discontinued in June 2006  replaced by the site that would eventually become Propeller com  Two continuations of the original Netscape com portal are available  Compuserve com  the Web site of Compuserve  and ISP Netscape com  the web site for Netscape s dial up discount ISP service  continue to use the Netscape com layout as it was before June 2006  Of the two  only the latter explicitly uses the Netscape branding   Netscape com is currently an AOL Netscape branded mirror duplicate of the AOL com portal with the URL  replacing the former social news website in September 2007  The social news site moved to the Propeller com domain  where it stayed until ending operations in October 2010  It features facilities such as news  sports  horoscopes  dating  movies  music and more  The change has come to much criticism amongst many site users  because the site has effectively become an AOL clone  and simply re directs to regional AOL portals in some areas across the globe  Netscape s exclusive features  such as the Netscape Blog  Netscape NewsQuake  Netscape Navigator  My Netscape and Netscape Community pages  are less accessible from the AOL Netscape designed portal and in some countries not accessible at all without providing a full URL or completing an Internet search  The new AOL Netscape site was originally previewed in August 2007 before moving the existing site in September 2007   Netscape co uk now redirects to AOL Search  with no Netscape branding at all   4 3  DMOZ  DMOZ  from directory mozilla org  its original domain name  also known as the Open Directory Project or ODP   is a multilingual open content directory of World Wide Web links owned by Netscape that is constructed and maintained by a community of volunteer editors   4 4  Netscape Forum Center  Netscape also has a wide variety of community based forums within Netscape Forum Center  including its browser s community support board  To post on the forums  users must possess an AOL Screenname account in which to sign in  referred to within the site as the Netscape Network  The same service is also available through Compuserve Forum Center   5  See also  Code Rush  a 1998 documentary about Netscape
