Pope John XXI    c  1215 – 20 May 1277   born Pedro Julião or Peter Juliani     was Pope from 13 September 1276 to his death in 1277  A Portuguese often identified with Pedro Hispano       he was the only Portuguese pope  although Damasus I can also be considered Portuguese  as he was born in territory that is nowadays in Portugal   He was also the only pope to have been a physician   Because he decided to skip the number XX  the previous pope named John was Pope John XIX  1024舑32   Pope John XXI is technically the 20th actual Pope John   1  Pre papal life  Pedro Julião was probably born in Lisbon between 1210 and 1220  He started his studies at the episcopal school of Lisbon Cathedral and later joined the University of Paris  although some historians claim that he was educated at Montpellier  Wherever he studied  he concentrated on medicine  theology  logic  physics  metaphysics and Aristotle s dialectic   There are some who believe he must be identified with an individual known as Peter of Spain  On the basis of this premise  he is the person who from 1245 to 1250 became known as Pedro Hispano  because he came from Hispania  the Iberian Peninsula   and taught medicine at the University of Siena  There  he wrote the Summulae Logicales  a reference manual on Aristotelian logic that remained in use in European universities for more than 300 years  He became famous as a university teacher  then returned to Lisbon  At the court of Guimarães he was the councilor and spokesman for King Afonso III of Portugal in church matters  Later  he became prior of Guimarães  He tried to become Bishop of Lisbon  but he was defeated  Instead  he became the master of the school of Lisbon  A notable philosopher with works in logic  he was also the responsible for the creation of the Square of opposition   Pedro became the physician of Pope Gregory X  1271舑76  early in his reign  In March 1273 he was elected Archbishop of Braga  but did not assume that post because on 3 June 1273 Gregory X created him Cardinal Bishop of Frascati   2  Papacy and death  After the death of Pope Adrian V on 18 August 1276  Pedro Hispano was elected Pope on 13 September  He was crowned a week later  One of John XXI s few acts during his brief reign was the reversal of a decree recently passed at the Second Council of Lyon  1274   the decree had not only confined cardinals in solitude until they elected a successor Pope  but also progressively restricted their supplies of food and wine if their deliberations took too long   Though much of John XXI s brief papacy was dominated by the powerful Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini  who succeeded him as Pope Nicholas III   John attempted to launch a crusade for the Holy Land  pushed for a union with the Eastern church  and did what he could to maintain peace between the Christian nations  He also launched a mission to convert the Tatars  but he died before it could start   To secure the necessary quiet for his medical studies  he had an apartment added to the papal palace at Viterbo  to which he could retire when he wished to work undisturbed  On 14 May 1277  while the pope was alone in this apartment  it collapsed  John was buried under the ruins and died on 20 May in consequence of the serious injuries he had received  He was buried in the Duomo di Viterbo  where his tomb can still be seen   3  Legacy  After his death  it was rumored that John XXI had actually been a magician  a suspicion frequently directed towards the few scholars among medieval popes even during their papacy  cf  Sylvester II   and that he was writing a heretical treatise in the room that collapsed on him  by an Act of God   In The Divine Comedy Dante sees John XXI  referred to as  Pietro Spano   in the Heaven of the Sun with the other spirits of great religious scholars   4  Medical works  One of the most comprehensive recipe books for pre  and post coital contraception was written by a  Pedro Hispano   who offered advice on birth control and how to provoke menstruation in his immensely popular Thesaurus Pauperum  Treasure of the Poor   Many of Peter’s recipes have been found surprisingly effective by contemporary research  and it is believed that women in antiquity had more control over their reproduction than previously believed  It is not clear  however  whether the author of the Thesaurus Pauperum was indeed the same person as Pope John XXI   5  References  Maxwell Stuart  P  G  Chronicle of the Popes  The Reign by Reign Record of the Papacy from St  Peter to the Present  Thames & Hudson  2002  p  119  ISBN 0 500 01798 0
