A propaganda film is a film that involves some form of propaganda  Propaganda films may be packaged in numerous ways  but are most often documentary style productions or fictional screenplays  that are produced to convince the viewer of a specific political point or influence the opinions or behavior of the viewer  often by providing subjective content that may be deliberately misleading   Propaganda can be defined as the ability  to produce and spread fertile messages that  once sown  will germinate in large human cultures ” However  in the 20th century  a “new” propaganda emerged  which revolved around political organizations and their need to communicate messages that would “sway relevant groups of people in order to accommodate their agendas”  First developed by the Lumiere brothers in 1896  film provided a unique means of accessing large audiences at once  Film was the first universal mass medium in that it could simultaneously influence viewers as individuals and members of a crowd  which led to it quickly becoming a tool for governments and non state organizations to project a desired ideological message  As Nancy Snow stated in her book  Information War  American Propaganda  Free Speech and Opinion Control Since 9 11  propaganda  begins where critical thinking ends    1  Film as a propaganda tool  Film is a unique medium in that it reproduces images  movement  and sound in a lifelike manner as it fuses meaning with evolvement as time passes in the story depicted  Unlike many other art forms  film produces a sense of immediacy  Film’s ability to create the illusion of life and reality  opening up new  unknown perspectives on the world  is why films  especially those of unknown cultures or places  are taken to be accurate depictions of life   Some film academics have noted film’s great illusory abilities  Dziga Vertov claimed in his 1924 manifesto  “The Birth of Kino Eye” that “the cinema eye is cinema truth ” To paraphrase Hilmar Hoffman  this means that in film  only what the camera ‘sees’ exists  and the viewer  lacking alternative perspectives  conventionally takes the image for reality   Films are effective propaganda tools because they establish visual icons of historical reality and consciousness  define public attitudes of the time they’re depicting or that at which they were filmed  mobilize people for a common cause  or bring attention to an unknown cause  Political and historical films represent  influence  and create historical consciousness and are able to distort events making it a persuasive and possibly untrustworthy medium   2  History  At the turn of the 20th century  films emerged as the new cultural agents  depicting events and showing foreign images to mass audiences in European and American cities  Politics and film began to intertwine with the reconstruction of the Boer War for a film audience and recordings of war in the Balkans  The new medium proved very useful for political and military interests when it came to reaching a broad segment of the population and creating consent or encouraging rejection of the real or imagined enemy  They also provided a forceful voice for independent critics of contemporary events   The earliest known propaganda film was a series of short silent films made during the Spanish–American War in 1898 created by Vitagraph Studios   At an epic 120 min running time  the 1912 Romanian Independenţa României is the first fictional film in the world with a deliberate propagandistic message  Filmed with a budget that will not be reached by a Romanian movie until 1970  Michael the Brave  supported by the Romanian communist regime also for propagandistic purposes   the movie was meant to shift the perception of the Romanian public towards an acceptance of Romanian involvement into an expected Balkan conflict  the First Balkan War    Another of the early fictional films to be used for propaganda was The Birth of a Nation  1915    2 1  World War I  Film was still relatively new to urban audiences with the outbreak of hostilities in 1914  Governments’ use of film as propaganda reflected this  The British and Americans’ initial struggles in the official use of film led to eventual success in their use of the medium  The Germans were off to a faster start in recognizing film’s value as a tool of perpetuating pro German sentiment in the US through The American Correspondent Film Company as well as on the front lines with their mobile cinemas  which showed feature films and newsreels   Though the Allied governments were slow to use film as a medium for conveying a desired position and set of beliefs  individuals  such as Charlie Chaplin were considerably more successful with The Bond and Zepped   2 2  Interwar period  In the years following the October Revolution of 1917  the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films  The development of Russian cinema in the 1920s by such filmmakers as Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein saw considerable progress in the use of the motion picture as a propaganda tool  yet it also served to develop the art of moviemaking  Eisenstein s films  in particular 1925 s The Battleship Potemkin  are seen as masterworks of the cinema  even as they glorify Eisenstein s Communist ideals  In depicting the 1905 Russian Revolution Potemkin sought to create a new history for Russia  one led and triumphed over by the formerly oppressed masses  Eisenstein was heavily influenced by the ideology of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution  which results in it providing better insight into the mindset of the later revolution than that which it depicted  Its dual purpose beyond forging a national Russian identity was to bring its revolutionary Communist message to the West  Its influence was feared in Germany to the extent that the government banned the film when it was released in the late 1920s  Another of Eisenstein s films  1927 s October  depicted the Bolshevik perspective on the October Revolution  culminating in the storming of the Winter Palace which provided Soviet viewers with the victory that the workers and peasants lacked in Battleship Potemkin  ending with Lenin  as played by an unknown worker  declaring that the government is overthrown  Because no documentary material existed of the storming of the palace  Eistenstein s re creation of the event has become the source material for historians and filmmakers  giving it further legitimacy as the accepted historical record  which illustrates its success as a propaganda film   Between the Great Wars American films celebrated the bravery of the American soldiers while depicting war as an existential nightmare  Films such as The Big Parade depicted the horrors of trench warfare  the brutal destruction of villages  and the lack of provisions   Meanwhile  Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films about the suffering of the German minority in Czechoslovakia and Poland  which were crucial towards creating popular support for occupying the Sudetenland and attacking Poland  Films like the 1941 Heimkehr  Homecoming  depicted the plight of homesick ethnic Germans in Poland longing to return to the Reich which in turn set the psychological conditions for the real attack and acceptance of the German policy  Lebensraum  living space    2 2 1  Cannabis and hemp  In the 1930s  anti drug propaganda was exampled in such films as Reefer Madness  1936   originally financed by a church group under the title Tell Your Children  was intended to be shown to parents as a morality tale attempting to teach them about the dangers of cannabis use  and Assassin of Youth  1937  about the supposed ill effects of cannabis  Hemp for Victory  1942  promoted the benefits of hemp and encouraged farmers to grow as much as possible for the war effort   2 3  World War II  The 1930s and 1940s  which saw the rise of totalitarian states and the Second World War  are arguably the  Golden Age of Propaganda   Nazi control of the German film industry is the most extreme example of the use of film in the service of a fascist national program and  in 1933  Hitler created the Reich Ministry for People s Enlightenment and Propaganda and appointed the youthful Joseph Goebbels as its head  Fritz Hippler  producer of one of the most powerful propaganda films of the time  1940 s The Eternal Jew  Der ewige Jude   ran the film department under Goebbels  The Eternal Jew purported to be a documentary depicting the Jewish world  insinuating that the Jewish population consisted of avaricious barbarians putting on a front for civilized European society  remaining indifferent and unaffected by the war  During this time Leni Riefenstahl  a filmmaker working in Nazi Germany  created one of the best known propaganda movies  Triumph of the Will  a film commissioned by Hitler to chronicle the 1934 Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg  Despite its controversial subject  the film is still recognized for its revolutionary approach to using music and cinematography  Another of Riefenstahl’s films  1938’s Olympia  was meant to prove that the Reich was a democratic and open society under Nazi rule  It had the perfect venue  the 1936 Berlin Olympics in which to showcase Adolf Hitler’s Aryan ideals and prowess  One of the most notable shots in the film is Hitler congratulating the African American Jesse Owens on his four gold medals  whose successes spoiled Hitler’s wish to depict those of African descent as racially inferior  The film won a number of prestigious film awards but fell from grace  particularly in the United States when  in November 1938  the world learned of the pogrom against the Jews  Riefenstahl’s cinematic masterpiece  though temporarily effective propaganda  was unable to mitigate the growing awareness of the political realities in Nazi Germany   In the United States during World War II  President Franklin D  Roosevelt recognized that the direct style of propaganda would not win over the American public  He assigned Lowell Mellett to the post of coordinator of government film  Although he had no jurisdiction over Hollywood films  he pressured the industry into helping the war effort  On 13 January 1945 Mellett stated in then confidential testimony that he was assigned to persuade the movie industry to  insert morale building and citizenry arousing themes in its films by all means possible   Luckily  many directors recognized the necessity  and likely the commercial success they would reap  of supporting the battle against fascism as public opinion lay with the war effort  One such filmmaker  Frank Capra  created a seven part U S  government sponsored series of films to support the war effort entitled Why We Fight  1942 5   This series is considered a highlight of the propaganda film genre  Other propaganda movies  such as Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo  1944  and Casablanca  1942   have become so well loved by film viewers that they can stand on their own as dramatic films  apart from their original role as propaganda vehicles  Charlie Chaplin once again joined the U S  war effort  creating The Great Dictator  1940   in which he played the Hitler like character of  Adenoid Hynkel  — this was preceded by some nine months by the short subject starring The Three Stooges  You Nazty Spy   as Moe Howard was the first American actor  as  Moe Hailstone   to spoof Hitler in film   Animation became popular  especially for winning over youthful audiences  Walt Disney and Looney Tunes were among those that actively aided the U S  war effort through their cartoons which provided training and instructions for viewers as well as a political commentary on the times  One of the most popular  Der Fuehrer s Face  1942  was a means of relieving the aggression against Hitler by making him a somewhat comical figure while showcasing the freedom America offered  Disney s Food Will Win the War  1942  attempts to make US citizens feel good by using US agriculture as a means of power  Also popular in the Soviet Union  the government produced such animated shorts as What Hitler Wants  which depicts a devilish Hitler giving Russian factories to capitalists  enslaving and riding once free Soviet citizens  but shows that the U S S R  will be prepared to fight  paying the Germans back in triplicate  ready to beat the  fascist pirates    Many of the dramatic war films in the early 1940s in the United States were designed to create a patriotic mindset and convince viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat  the enemy   Despite fears that too much propaganda could diminish Hollywood’s entertainment appeal  reducing its targeted audience and decreasing profits  military enlistment increased and morale was considered to be higher  in part attributed to America s innovative propaganda  One of the conventions of the genre was to depict a racial and socioeconomic cross section of the United States  either a platoon on the front lines or soldiers training on a base  which come together to fight for the good of the country  In Italy  at the same time  film directors like Roberto Rossellini produced propaganda films for similar purposes   Similar to Nazi Germany  the U S S R  prepared its citizens for war by releasing dramas  such as Sergei Eisenstein s iconic Alexander Nevsky  The U S S R also screened films depicting partisan activity and the suffering inflicted by the Nazis  such as Girl No  217  which showed a Russian girl enslaved by an inhumane German family  Films were shown on propaganda trains while newsreels were screened in subway stations to reach those who were unable to pay to see films in the theater   2 4  Cold War  When describing life in Communist countries  western propaganda sought to depict an image of a brainwashed citizenry which was then held captive by their government  The CIA s Office of Policy Coordination adapted George Orwell s Animal Farm into an animated movie in 1954 that was released in England as production costs were considerably lower   During the 1960s  the United States produced propaganda films that cheerily instructed civilians how to build homemade fallout shelters  to protect themselves in the event of nuclear war   Red Dawn  1984  depicts an alternate 1980s in which the United States is invaded by the Soviet Union  Cuba  Nicaragua  and other Latin American allies of the U S S R  and a group of small town high school students engage in guerrilla warfare in their resistance of the occupation  eventually beating the communists  It has been considered by some to be right wing propaganda   Pork Chop Hill  1959  was the most notable 1950s American anti war propaganda piece about the Korean war  Milestone was known for his previous anti war films  including 1930 s All Quiet on the Western Front and Shangganling  The Battle of Sangkumryung Ridge or Triangle Hill  1956   which was the most influential film on the Chinese in that era  Both Pork Chop Hill and Shangganling depict a single battle in which a small dedicated unit defends a small holdout with very little hope of reprieve  Like all propaganda the importance of the film is not the battle itself but the outstanding characteristics of such individuals who would commit such acts of patriotism for their home and country   2 5  Post 9 11  Over 100 years since its creation  film continues to resonate with viewers and helps influence or reinforce a particular viewpoint  Following the 9 11 attacks  many Americans were split on the success of the government’s response and the ensuing war in Afghanistan and Iraq  Similar to the Vietnam War  filmmakers expressed their view of the attacks and feelings about the war through films  most notably  Fahrenheit 9 11  2004   The film sparked debate across the country  presenting mixed assessments on the role of the U S  government and its response along with the controversy that normally arises when depicting recent  traumatic events  Director Michael Moore omits footage of the planes striking the Twin Towers  cutting directly to the aftermath and destruction  Alan Petersen’s Fahrenhype 9 11 was released in response to Fahrenheit 9 11 s success in theaters  Petersen called Fahrenheit 9 11  the Road Runner of manipulation   removing all avenues of thought through over determination   leaving no room for the viewer s own judgment   It received considerably less press and screentime than Moore s controversial piece   Ayman al Zawahiri stated that “We are in a media battle for the hearts and minds of our umma  community  of Muslims ” Towards winning the hearts and minds of the MENA region  Al Qaeda and its affiliates have produced propaganda films and documentaries depicting jihadist attacks  last will and testament videos  training  and interviews  all meant to boost morale among supporters  Al Qaeda established a Media Committee early in its inception to handle traditional Western and Arab media as well as create an online media presence  which was established through the multi media company as Sahab in 2001  The company  which produces documentary like films and operational videos for Afghanistan is known for its technological sophistication  cinematic effects  and their efforts to reach the west with translations and subtitling  Its operational videos were serialized in Pyre for Americans in Khorasan  Afghanistan   Other productions in North Africa include Apostate in Hell  a Somali film produced by al Fajr Media Center includes interviews with Somali jihadists  training of fighters  preparation for an attack  and actual operations  It along with many other al Qaeda videos is distributed by Arabic jihadist websites as that community relies on the Internet to a high degree to disseminate information to followers   2 6  Food  health  and beyond  Elements of propaganda films can also be incorporated into films that have messages that seek to implement positive change within society  However  what one generation may see as positive  later generations may experience negative effects from    Food As mentioned previously  Walt Disney s Food Will Win the War  1942  attempts to make US citizens feel good by using US agriculture as a means of power  In 1943  the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  introduced its  Basic 7  nutrition guide  a precursor to the food pyramid   In the same year  the United States Office of War Information released Food for Fighters about the importance of nutrition in wartime  Between the 1940s and 1970s the Green Revolution increased agriculture production around the world which led to further increases in farm size and a reduction in the number of farms  Advances in fertilizers  herbicides  insecticides  fungicides  antibiotics  and growth hormones  reduced crop wastage due to weeds  insects  and diseases at the expense of health and safety from agricultural pollution  Good Eating Habits  1951  by Coronet Films is a drama focusing on gluttony and  hidden hunger   where well nourished people eat poorly and malnourish themselves  Miracles From Agriculture  1960  from the USDA presents then supermarkets as the showplaces of agriculture  discussing methods of improvement in the growing  handling  processing  and shipping of food products and the cooperative assistance offered by agricultural and food processing research centers  the film also hypothesizes that a nation grows according to the productivity of its agriculture   Since the 1990s to the present  responses to mad cow disease  genetically modified foods  flu epidemics in pigs and birds  and an increase in foodborne illness outbreaks  agricultural pollution  and Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations  CAFOs  have led people to question where their food comes from and what is actually in it  The use of antibiotics and hormones in cattle and birds  artificial food additives like artificial colors flavors  artificial sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup and aspartame  artificial preservatives  etc   prompted  propaganda  films like Super Size Me  2004   King Corn  2007   Food  Inc   2008   Forks Over Knives  2011   and others to promote food awareness  organic farming and eating local organic food
