Minoru Yamasaki  December 1  1912February 7  1986  was an American architect  best known for designing the original World Trade Center in New York City and several other large scale projects  Yamasaki was one of the most prominent architects of the 20th century  He and fellow architect Edward Durell Stone are generally considered to be the two master practitioners of  New Formalism    1  Early life and education  Yamasaki was born in Seattle  Washington  a second generation Japanese American  son of John Tsunejiro Yamasaki and Hana Yamasaki  He grew up in Auburn  Washington and graduated from Garfield Senior High School in Seattle  He enrolled in the University of Washington program in architecture in 1929  and graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture  B Arch   in 1934  During his college years  he was strongly encouraged by faculty member Lionel Pries  He earned money to pay for his tuition by working at an Alaskan salmon cannery   After moving to New York City in the 1930s  he enrolled at New York University for a master s degree in architecture and got a job with the architecture firm Shreve  Lamb & Harmon  designers of the Empire State Building  In 1945  Yamasaki moved to Detroit  where he was hired by Smith  Hinchman & Grylls  The firm helped Yamasaki avoid internment as a Japanese American during World War II  and he himself sheltered his parents in New York City  Yamasaki left the firm in 1949  and started his own partnership  One of the first projects he designed at his own firm was Ruhl s Bakery at 7 Mile Road and Monica Street in Detroit  In 1964  Yamasaki received a D F A  from Bates College   Yamasaki was first married in 1941 and had two other wives before marrying his first wife again in 1969  He died of stomach cancer in 1986  His firm  Yamasaki & Associates  closed on December 31  2009   2  Career  His first internationally recognized design  the Pacific Science Center with its iconic arches  was constructed by the City of Seattle for the 1962 Seattle World s Fair  His first significant project was the Pruitt–Igoe housing project in St  Louis  Missouri  1955  Despite his love of Japanese traditional design  this was a stark  modernist concrete structure  The housing project experienced so many problems that it was demolished in 1972  less than twenty years after its completion  Its destruction is considered by some to be the beginning of postmodern architecture   In 1955  he also designed the  sleek  terminal at Lambert–St  Louis International Airport which led to his 1959 commission to design the Dhahran International Airport in Saudi Arabia  During this period  he created a number of office buildings which led to his innovative design of the towers of the World Trade Center in 1964  which began construction March 21  1966  The first of the towers was finished in 1970  Many of his buildings feature superficial details inspired by the pointed arches of Gothic architecture  and make use of extremely narrow vertical windows  This narrow windowed style arose from his own personal fear of heights  One particular design challenge of the World Trade Center s design related to the efficacy of the elevator system  which was unique in the world  Yamasaki was able to integrate the fastest elevators created at the time  running at 1 700 feet per minute  Then  instead of placing a large traditional elevator shaft in the core of each tower  Yamasaki created the Twin Towers   Skylobby  system  The Skylobby design created three separate  connected elevator systems which would serve different segments of the building  depending on which floor was chosen  saving approximately 70% of the space that would have been used for a traditional shaft  the space saved was then used for office space   It was in 1978 that Yamasaki also designed the Federal Reserve Bank tower in Richmond  Virginia  The work was designed with a similar appearance as the World Trade Center complex  with its narrow fenestration  and now stands at    Yamasaki was a member of the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission  created in 1961 to restore the grand avenue in Washington  D C   but resigned after disagreements and disillusionment with the design by committee approach   After teaming up with Emery Roth and Sons on the design of the World Trade Center  they teamed up again on other projects including new defense buildings at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington  D C   Yamasaki designed two notable synagogues during this period  North Shore Congregation Israel in Glencoe  Illinois in 1964 and Temple Beth El  in Bloomfield Hills  Michigan  just north of Detroit in 1973  He also designed a number of buildings on the campus of Carleton College in Northfield  Minnesota between 1958 and 1968   3  Gallery  File Pruitt Igoe overview
