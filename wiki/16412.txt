Alice Bradley Sheldon  August 24  1915 舑 May 19  1987  was an American science fiction author better known as James Tiptree  Jr   a pen name she used from 1967 to her death  From 1974 to 1977 the pen name Raccoona Sheldon was also used  She was most notable for breaking down the barriers between writing perceived as inherently  male  or  female  舒 it was not publicly known until 1977 that James Tiptree  Jr  was a woman   Tiptree was inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2012   1  Early life  Bradley came from a family in the intellectual enclave of Hyde Park  a university neighborhood in Chicago  Her father was Herbert Bradley  a lawyer and naturalist  and her mother was Mary Hastings Bradley  a prolific writer of fiction and travel books  She travelled the world with her parents from an early age  In 1921–22  the Bradleys made their first trip to central Africa  which later contributed to Sheldon’s short story   The Women Men Don t See   She was a graphic artist and a painter  and — under the name  Alice Bradley Davey  — an art critic for the Chicago Sun between 1941 and 1942  She met and married William Davey  her first husband  at age 19 because she felt it was her duty as a daughter  They were married from 1934 until 1941   In 1942 she joined the United States Army Air Forces and worked in the Army Air Forces photo intelligence group  She later was promoted to major  a high rank for women  In the army  she  felt she was among free women for the first time   In 1945 she married her second husband  Huntington D Sheldon  at the close of the war on her assignment in Paris  She was discharged from the military in 1946  at which time she set up a small business in partnership with her husband  The same year her first story   The Lucky Ones   was published in the November 16  1946 issue of The New Yorker  and credited to  Alice Bradley  in the magazine itself  In 1952 she and her husband were invited to join the CIA  She resigned in 1955 to return to college   She studied for her Bachelor of Arts degree at American University  1957舑59   going on to achieve a doctorate at George Washington University in Experimental Psychology in 1967  She wrote her doctoral dissertation on the responses of animals to novel stimuli in differing environments  She submitted a few science fiction stories under the name James Tiptree Jr  to protect her academic reputation   Sheldon had a complex sexual orientation  which she described in different terms over the years   I like some men a lot  but from the start  before I knew anything  it was always girls and women who lit me up    2  Science fiction career  Unsure what to do with her new degrees and her new old careers  Sheldon began to write science fiction  She adopted the pseudonym of James Tiptree Jr  in 1967  The name  Tiptree  came from a branded jar of marmalade  and the  Jr   was her husband s idea  In an interview  she said   A male name seemed like good camouflage  I had the feeling that a man would slip by less observed  I ve had too many experiences in my life of being the first woman in some damned occupation   Her first published short story was  Birth of a Salesman  in the March 1968 issue of Analog Science Fiction  edited by John W  Campbell  Three more followed that year in If and Fantastic   The pseudonym was successfully maintained until the late 1970s  partly because  although  Tiptree  was widely known to be a pseudonym  it was generally understood that its use was intended to protect the professional reputation of an intelligence community official  Readers  editors and correspondents were permitted to assume sex  and generally  but not invariably  they assumed  male   There was speculation  based partially on the themes in her stories  that Tiptree might be female     Tiptree  never made any public appearances  but she did correspond regularly with fans and other science fiction authors through the mail  When asked for biographical details  Tiptree Sheldon was forthcoming in everything but her sex  Many of the details given above  the Air Force career  the Ph D   were mentioned in letters  Tiptree  wrote  and also appeared in official author biographies    After the death of Mary Hastings Bradley in 1976   Tiptree  mentioned in a letter that  his  mother  also a writer  had died in Chicago 舒 details that led inquiring fans to find the obituary  with its reference to Alice Sheldon  soon all was revealed  Several prominent science fiction writers suffered some embarrassment  Robert Silverberg had written an introduction to Warm Worlds and Otherwise arguing  from the evidence of stories in that collection  that Tiptree could not possibly be a woman  Harlan Ellison had introduced Tiptree s story in the anthology Again  Dangerous Visions with the opinion that   Kate  Wilhelm is the woman to beat this year  but Tiptree is the man   Silverberg s article in particular  by taking one side  makes it clear that the sex of Tiptree was a topic of some debate   Only then did she complete her first full length novel  Up the Walls of the World  Berkley Books  1978   which was a Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club selection  Before that she worked on and built a reputation only in the field of short stories   3  Works  Tiptree Sheldon was an eclectic writer who worked in a variety of styles and subgenres  often combining the technological focus and hard edged style of  hard  science fiction with the sociological and psychological concerns of  soft  SF  and some of the stylistic experimentation of the New Wave movement   After writing several stories in more conventional modes  she produced her first work to draw widespread acclaim   The Last Flight of Doctor Ain   in 1969  One of her shortest stories   Ain  is a sympathetic portrait of a scientist whose concern for Earth s ecological suffering leads him to destroy the entire human race   Many of her stories have a milieu reminiscent of the space opera and pulp tales she read in her youth  but typically with a much darker tone  the cosmic journeys of her characters are often linked to a drastic spiritual alienation  and or a transcendent experience which brings fulfillment but also death  John Clute  noting Tiptree s  inconsolable complexities of vision   concluded that  It is very rarely that a James Tiptree story does not both deal directly with death and end with a death of the spirit  or of all hope  or of the race   Notable stories of this type include  Painwise   in which a space explorer has been altered to be immune to pain but finds such an existence intolerable  and  A Momentary Taste of Being   in which the true purpose of humanity  found on a distant planet  renders individual human life entirely pointless   Another major theme is the tension between free will and biological determinism  or reason and sexual desire   Love Is the Plan the Plan Is Death   one of the rare SF stories in which no humans appear  describes an alien creature s romantic rationalizations for the brutal instincts that drive its life cycle   The Screwfly Solution  suggests that humans might similarly rationalize a plague of murderous sexual insanity  Sex in Tiptree s writing is frankly portrayed  a sometimes playful but more often threatening force   Before the revelation of Sheldon s identity  Tiptree was often referred to as an unusually macho male  see  e g   Robert Silverberg s commentaries  as well as an unusually feminist science fiction writer  for a male  舒 particularly for  The Women Men Don t See   a story of two women who go looking for aliens to escape from male dominated society on Earth  However  Sheldon s view of sexual politics could be ambiguous  as in the ending of  Houston  Houston  Do You Read    where a society of female clones must deal with three time traveling male astronauts   One of the themes prevalent throughout most of Sheldon’s work is feminism  In  The Women Men Don’t See  Sheldon gives a feminist story a unique spin by making the narrator  Don Fenton  a male  Fenton judges the Parsons based on their attractiveness and is agitated when they do not  fulfil stereotypical female roles   according to Anne Cranny Francis  In addition  Fenton s inability to understand both the plight of woman and Ruth Parson s feelings of alienation further illustrate the differences of men and women in society  The theme of feminism is emphasized by  the feminist ideology espoused by Ruth Parsons and the contrasting sexism of Fenton   The title of the short story itself reflects the idea that women are invisible during Sheldon’s time  As Francis states   ‘The Women Men Don’t See’ is an outstanding example     of the subversive use of genre fiction to produce an unconventional discursive position  the feminist subject    Sheldon s two novels  produced toward the end of her career  were not as critically well received as her best known stories but continued to explore similar themes  Some of her best regarded work can be found in the collection Her Smoke Rose Up Forever  available in paperback through Tachyon Publications as of 2004   4  Death  Sheldon continued writing under the Tiptree pen name for another decade  On May 19  1987  at age 71  Sheldon took the life of her 84 year old  nearly blind husband and then took her own  They were found dead  hand in hand in bed  in their Virginia home  According to biographer Julie Phillips  the suicide note Sheldon left was written years earlier  and saved until needed  In an interview with Charles Platt in the early 1980s Sheldon spoke of her emotional problems and previous suicide attempts  Much of her work contains dark and pessimistic elements  which in retrospect can be seen as reflective of her troubled emotions   The James Tiptree  Jr  Award is given in her honor each year for a work of science fiction or fantasy that expands or explores our understanding of gender  The award winning science fiction authors Karen Joy Fowler and Pat Murphy created the award in February 1991  Novels such as  Half Life  by Shelley Jackson and  Light  by M  John Harrison have received the award   5  Quotes about James Tiptree  Jr   James Tiptree s surface was often airy and at times hilarious  and her control of genre conventions allowed her to convey the bleakness of her abiding insights in tales that remain seductively readable  but she was  in the end  incapable of dissimulation   舒 from The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction  by John Clute and Peter Nicholls   Sheldon was simply one of the best short story writers of our day      She has already had an enormous impact on upcoming generations of SF writers  Her footprints are all over cyberpunk turf      舒 Gardner Dozois  in Locus magazine  1987   Her stories and novels are humanistic  while her deep concern for male female  even human alien  harmony ran counter to the developing segregate the sexes drive amongst feminist writers  What her work brought to the genre was a blend of lyricism and inventiveness  as if some lyric poet had rewritten a number of clever SF standards and then passed them on to a psychoanalyst for final polish   舒 Brian Aldiss  Trillion Year Spree    Tip  was a crucial part of modern SF s maturing process      He      wrote powerful fiction challenging readers  assumptions about everything  especially sex and gender   舒 Suzy McKee Charnas  The Women s Review of Books    Tiptree s work is  proof of what she said  that men and women can and do speak both to and for one another  if they have bothered to learn how   舒 Ursula K  Le Guin  Khatru   It has been suggested that Tiptree is female  a theory that I find absurd  for there is to me something ineluctably masculine about Tiptree s
