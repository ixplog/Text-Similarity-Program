William Bradford Shockley Jr   February 13  1910 – August 12  1989  was an American physicist and inventor  Shockley was the manager of a research group that included John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain  the duo who invented the transistor  The three were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics   Shockley s attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the 1950s and 1960s led to California s  Silicon Valley  becoming a hotbed of electronics innovation  In his later life  Shockley was a professor at Stanford and became a proponent of eugenics   1  Early life and education  Shockley was born in London  England to American parents  and raised in his family s hometown of Palo Alto  California  from age three  His father  William Hillman Shockley  was a mining engineer who speculated in mines for a living  and spoke eight languages  His mother  Mary  née Bradford   grew up in the American West  graduated from Stanford University  and became the first female US Deputy mining surveyor   Shockley received his Bachelor of Science degree from Caltech in 1932  Shockley received his Ph D  degree from MIT in 1936  The title of his doctoral thesis was Electronic Bands in Sodium Chloride  His thesis topic was suggested by his thesis advisor  John C  Slater  After receiving his doctorate  Shockley joined a research group headed by Clinton Davisson at Bell Labs in New Jersey  The next few years were productive ones for Shockley  He published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in Physical Review  In 1938  he got his first patent   Electron Discharge Device   on electron multipliers   2  Career  When World War II broke out  Shockley became involved in radar research at the Bell labs in Manhattan  New York  In May 1942  he took leave from Bell Labs to become a research director at Columbia University s Anti Submarine Warfare Operations Group  This involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved convoying techniques  optimizing depth charge patterns  and so on  This project required frequent trips to the Pentagon and Washington  where Shockley met many high ranking officers and government officials  In 1944  he organized a training program for B 29 bomber pilots to use new radar bomb sights  In late 1944 he took a three month tour to bases around the world to assess the results  For this project  Secretary of War Robert Patterson awarded Shockley the Medal for Merit on October 17  1946   In July 1945  the War Department asked Shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the Japanese mainland  Shockley concluded   This report influenced the decision for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to force Japan to surrender without an invasion   2 1  Development of transistor  Shortly after the end of the war in 1945  Bell Labs formed a solid state physics group  led by Shockley and chemist Stanley Morgan  which included John Bardeen  Walter Brattain  physicist Gerald Pearson  chemist Robert Gibney  electronics expert Hilbert Moore  and several technicians  Their assignment was to seek a solid state alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers  Its first attempts were based on Shockley s ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity  These experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials  The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor  The group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work  The rapport of the group was excellent  and ideas were freely exchanged   By the winter of 1946 they had enough results that Bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to Physical Review  Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor s surface  This led to several more papers  one of them co authored with Shockley   which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments  The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes  Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily  Finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson  acting on a suggestion by Shockley  put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate  a viscous chemical that did not evaporate  commonly used in electrolytic capacitors  and obtained by puncturing an example capacitor with a nail  using a hammer  placed across a P N junction   Bell Labs  attorneys soon discovered Shockley s field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in 1930 by Julius Lilienfeld  who filed his MESFET like patent in Canada on October 22  1925  Although the patent appeared  breakable   it could not work  the patent attorneys based one of its four patent applications only on the Bardeen Brattain point contact design  Three others  submitted first  covered the electrolyte based transistors with Bardeen  Gibney and Brattain as the inventors  Shockley s name was not on any of these patent applications  This angered Shockley  who thought his name should also be on the patents because the work was based on his field effect idea  He even made efforts to have the patent written only in his name  and told Bardeen and Brattain of his intentions   Shockley  angered by not being included on the patent applications  secretly continued his own work to build a different sort of transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts  he expected this kind of design would be more likely to be commercially viable  The point contact transistor  he believed  would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture  Shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection  On February 13  1948 another team member  John N  Shive  built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium  proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought  Shive s invention sparked Shockley s invention of the junction transistor  A few months later he invented an entirely new  considerably more robust  type of transistor with a layer or  sandwich  structure  This structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s  and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor  Shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were  mixture of cooperation and competition   He also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his  hand was forced  by Shive s 1948 advance  Shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the  sandwich  transistor  and a first proof of principle was obtained on April 7  1949   Meanwhile  Shockley worked on his magnum opus  Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors which was published as a 558 page treatise in 1950  The tome included Shockley s critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals  Shockley s diode equation is also described  This seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors   This resulted in his invention of the junction transistor  which was announced at a press conference on July 4  1951   In 1951  he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences  NAS   He was forty one years old  this was rather young for such an election  Two years later  he was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious Comstock Prize for Physics by the NAS  and was the recipient of many other awards and honors   The ensuing publicity generated by the  invention of the transistor  often thrust Shockley to the fore  much to the chagrin of Bardeen and Brattain  Bell Labs management  however  consistently presented all three inventors as a team  Though Shockley would correct the record where reporters gave him sole credit for the invention  he eventually infuriated and alienated Bardeen and Brattain  and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor  Bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs in 1951  Brattain refused to work with Shockley further and was assigned to another group  Neither Bardeen nor Brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention   2 2  Shockley Semiconductor  In 1956 Shockley moved from New Jersey to Mountain View  California to start Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother in Palo Alto  California  The company  a division of Beckman Instruments  Inc   was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley    His way  could generally be summed up as domineering and increasingly paranoid  In one well known incident  he claimed that a secretary s cut thumb was the result of a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit  After receiving the Nobel Prize in 1956  his demeanor changed as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic  erratic and hard to please management style  In late 1957  eight of Shockley s researchers  who would come to be known as the  traitorous eight   resigned after Shockley decided not to continue research into silicon based semiconductors  They went on to form Fairchild Semiconductor  a loss from which Shockley Semiconductor never recovered  Over the course of 20 years  these eight of Shockley s former employees started 65 new enterprises   2 3  Later years  When Shockley was eased out of the directorship of Shockley Semiconductor  he joined Stanford University  where he was appointed the Alexander M  Poniatoff Professor of Engineering and Applied Science   3  Personal life   Marriage and children While still a student  Shockley married Iowan Jean Bailey in August 1933  In March 1934  the couple had a baby girl  Alison  He became an accomplished rock climber  going often to the Shawangunks in the Hudson River Valley  where he pioneered a route across an overhang  known to this day as  Shockley s Ceiling    Shockley was popular as speaker  lecturer  and an amateur magician  He once  magically  produced a bouquet of roses at the end of his address before the American Physical Society  He was also known in his early years for his elaborate practical jokes   Shockley was first to propose a lognormal distribution to model the creation process for scientific research papers  He was an atheist    Political views Late in his life  Shockley became intensely interested in questions of race  human intelligence  and eugenics  He thought this work was important to the genetic future of the human species  and came to describe it as the most important work of his career  even though expressing his views damaged his reputation  Shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect  and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization  Shockley s published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist Cyril Burt and were funded by the Pioneer Fund  Shockley also proposed that individuals with IQs below 100 be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization   Anthropologist Roger Pearson  whose writings are based on an evolutionary and racialist approach and who has received funding from the Pioneer Fund  has defended Shockley in a self published book co authored with Shockley  University of Wisconsin Milwaukee professor Edgar G  Epps argued that  William Shockley s position lends itself to racist interpretations     Genetics He donated sperm to the Repository for Germinal Choice  a sperm bank founded by Robert Klark Graham in hopes of spreading humanity s best genes  The bank  called by the media the  Nobel Prize sperm bank   claimed to have three Nobel Prize winning donors  though Shockley was the only one to publicly acknowledge his donation to the sperm bank  However  Shockley s controversial views brought the Repository for Germinal Choice a degree of notoriety and may have discouraged other Nobel Prize winners from donating sperm    Relation with the media In 1981 he filed a libel suit against the Atlanta Constitution after a science writer  Roger Witherspoon  compared Shockley s advocacy of a voluntary sterilization program to Nazi experiments on Jews  The suit took three years to go to trial  Shockley won the suit but received only one dollar in actual damages and no punitive damages  Shockley s biographer Joel Shurkin  a science writer on the staff of Stanford University during those years  sums this up as saying that the statement was defamatory  but Shockley s reputation was not worth much by the time the trial reached a verdict   Shockley taped his telephone conversations with reporters  and then sent the transcript to them by registered mail  At one point he toyed with the idea of making them take a simple quiz on his work before discussing the subject with them  His habit of saving all his papers  even laundry lists  provides abundant documentation for researchers on his life   4  Death  Shockley died in 1989 of prostate cancer   By the time of his death he was almost completely estranged from most of his friends and family  except his wife who died in 2007  His children are reported to have learned of his death only through the print media   A group of about thirty colleagues  who have met on and off since 1956  met at Stanford in 2002 to reminisce about their time with Shockley and his central role in sparking the information technology revolution  its organizer saying  Shockley is the man who brought silicon to Silicon Valley    5  Honors  He received the National Medal of Merit for his war work in 1946   He received the Comstock Prize in Physics of the National Academy of Sciences in 1953   He was the first recipient of the Oliver E  Buckley Solid State Physics Prize of the American Physical Society in 1953   Shockley was a co recipient of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956  along with Bardeen and Brattain  In his Nobel lecture  he gave full credit to Brattain and Bardeen as the inventors of the point contact transistor  The three of them  together with wives and guests  had a rather raucous late night champagne fueled party to celebrate together   Holley Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1963   He received honorary science doctorates from the University of Pennsylvania  Rutgers University in New Jersey  and Gustavus Adolphus Colleges in Minnesota   Maurice Liebman Memorial Prize from the Institute of Radio Engineers  now the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE  in 1980   Shockley was named by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century   In 2011  he was listed at #3 on the Boston Globe s MIT150 list of the top 150 innovators and ideas in the 150 year history of MIT   6  Patents  Shockley was granted over ninety US patents  Some notable ones are   Apr  4  1950  his first granted patent involving transistors
