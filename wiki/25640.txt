Romania has a developing  upper middle income market economy  the 17th largest in the European Union by total nominal GDP and the 13th largest based on purchasing power parity  The collapse of the Communist regime in 1989  reforms in the 2000s  decade  and its 2007 accession to the European Union have led to an improved economic outlook   Romania has experienced growth in foreign investment with a cumulative FDI totaling more than $170 billion since 1989   Up until the late 2000s financial crisis  the Romanian economy has been referred to as a  Tiger  due to its high growth rates and rapid development   Until 2009  Romanian economic growth was among the fastest in Europe  officially 8 4% in 2008 and more than three times the EU average   The country is a regional leader in multiple fields  such as IT and motor vehicle production   Bucharest  the capital city  is one of the largest financial and industrial centres in Eastern Europe   1  History  1 1  Before World War II  After World War I  the application of radical agricultural reforms and the passing of a new constitution created a democratic framework and allowed for quick economic growth  industrial production doubled between 1923–1938  despite the effects of the Great Depression   With oil production of 7 2 million tons in 1937  Romania ranked second in Europe and seventh in the world  The oil extracted from Romania was essential for the German war campaigns   Before World War II  Romania was Europe s second largest food producer   1 2  Economy during 1944–1989  After the Second World War  Romania became a member of the Eastern Bloc  and switched to a socialist style command economy  During this period the country experienced rapid industrialization in an attempt to create a  multilaterally developed socialist society   Economic growth was further fueled by foreign credits in the 1970s  but this eventually led to a growing foreign debt  which peaked at $11–12 billion   Romania s debt was largely paid off during the 1980s by implementing severe austerity measures which deprived Romanians of basic consumer goods  In 1989  before the Romanian Revolution  Romania had a GDP of about 800 billion lei  or $53 6 billion  Around 58% of the country s gross national income came from industry  and another 15% came from agriculture  The minimum wage was 2 000 lei  or $135   1 3  Free market transition  Privatization of industry was pursued with the 1992 transfer of 30% of the shares of some 6 000 state owned enterprises to five private ownership funds  in which each adult citizen received certificates of ownership  The remaining 70% ownership of the enterprises was transferred to a state ownership fund  with a mandate to sell off its shares at the rate of at least 10% per year  The privatization law also called for direct sale of some 30 specially selected enterprises and the sale of  assets   i e   commercially viable component units  of larger enterprises   As of 2008  inflation stood at 7 8%  up from 4 8% in 2007 estimated by the BNR at coming within 6% for the year 2006  the year on year CPI  published in March 2007  is 3 66%   Also  since 2001  the economy has grown steadily at around 6–8%  Therefore  the PPP per capita GDP of Romania in 2008 was estimated to be between $12 200 and $14 064   Financial and technical assistance continued to flow in from the U S   European Union  other industrial nations  and international financial institutions facilitating Romania s reintegration into the world economy  The International Monetary Fund  IMF   World Bank  IBRD   the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  EBRD   and the U S  Agency for International Development  USAID  all had programs and resident representatives in Romania  Romania also attracted foreign direct investment  which in 2008 rose to $72 billion   Romania was the largest U S  trading partner in Central Eastern Europe until Ceauşescu s 1988 renunciation of Most Favored Nation  non discriminatory  trading status  the latter of which resulted in high U S  tariffs on Romanian products  Congress approved restoration of the MFN status effective 8 November 1993  as part of a new bilateral trade agreement  Tariffs on most Romanian products dropped to zero in February 1994 with the inclusion of Romania in the Generalized System of Preferences  GSP   Major Romanian exports to the U S  include shoes and clothing  steel  and chemicals   Romania signed an Association Agreement with the EU in 1992 and a free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association  EFTA  in 1993  codifying Romania s access to European markets and creating the basic framework for further economic integration  At the Helsinki Summit in December 1999  the European Union invited Romania to formally begin accession negotiations  In 2002  the target date of 2007 was set for Romania  along with Bulgaria  for its accession efforts  This was confirmed in 2003 at the Thessaloniki Summit and then in early 2005 Romania and Bulgaria signed the adherence treaty to EU  They formally joined the EU on 1 January 2007   During the latter part of the Ceauşescu period  Romania earned significant credits from several Arab countries  notably Iraq  for work related to the oil industry  In August 2005  Romania agreed to forgive 43% of the US$1 7 billion debt owed by an Iraq still largely occupied by the military forces of the U S  led  Coalition of the Willing   making Romania the first country outside of the Paris Club of wealthy creditor nations to forgive Iraqi debts   Growth in 2000–07 was supported by exports to the EU  primarily to Italy and Germany  and a strong recovery of foreign and domestic investment  Domestic demand is playing an ever more important role in underpinning growth as interest rates drop and the availability of credit cards and mortgages increases  Current account deficits of around 2% of GDP are beginning to decline as demand for Romanian products in the European Union increases  Recent accession to the EU gives further impetus and direction to structural reform   In early 2004 the government passed increases in the Value Added Tax  VAT  and tightened eligibility for social benefits with the intention to bring the public finance gap down to 4% of GDP by 2006  but more difficult pension and healthcare reforms will have to wait until after the next elections  Privatization of the state owned bank Banca Comercială Română took place in 2005  Intensified restructuring among large enterprises  improvements in the financial sector  and effective use of available EU funds is expected to accelerate economic growth  However  the Romanian economy was affected by the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 and contracted in 2009   1 4  EU membership  2007   On 1 January 2007 Romania entered the EU  This led to some immediate international trade liberalization  but there was no shock to the economy  The government is running annual surpluses of above 2%   This is to be contrasted with enormous current account deficits  Low interest rates guarantee availability of funds for investment and consumption  For example  a boom in the real estate market started around 2000 and has not subsided yet  At the same time annual inflation in the economy is variable and during the mid 2000s  2003–2008  has seen a low of 2 3% and high of 7 8%   Most importantly  this poses a threat to the country s accession to the Eurozone  The Romanian government initially planned for the euro to replace the leu in 2012  However  experts predict that this might happen as late as in 2014  From a political point of view  there is a trade off between Romania s economic growth and the stability required for early accession to the monetary union  Romania s per capita PPP GDP is still only about a 40% of the EU average  while the country s nominal GDP per capita is about 25% of the EU average   In the winter of 2004 the government introduced a flat tax of 16% that was introduced on 1 January 2005  This is done in hope for higher GDP growth and greater tax collection rates  The reform  which some called a  revolution  in taxation  was met with mild discussions and some protests by affected working classes  Romania subsequently enjoyed the lowest fiscal burden in the European Union  until Bulgaria also switched to a flat tax of 10% in 2007   The accession of Romania to the European Union has given the Union access to the Black Sea   1 5  2009 IMF loan  At the end of March 2009 Romania signed a deal for 20 billion Euro in loan  12 95 Billion Euro will come from the IMF  5 Billion Euro will come from the European Union  1 5 Billion – from the World Bank and about 1 Billion – from other international financial institutions  The interest paid by Romania will be 3 5% per year  In return for the loan  Romanian has committed to severe cuts in public spending and wages  One year later  the government cut civil servants  wages by 25%  while thousands of state jobs were axed and VAT was increased by 19% to 24%   2  The economy  In the Romanian press the economy has been referred to as the  Tiger of the East  during the 2000s  Romania is a country of considerable economic potential  over 10 million hectares of agricultural land  diverse energy sources  coal  oil  natural gas  hydro  nuclear and wind   a substantial  if aging  manufacturing base and opportunities for expanded development in tourism on the Black Sea and in the mountains   2 1  National budget  The national budget for 2013 was 230 billion leu  69 38 billion dollars   which represents 32 9% from the GDP according to the Ministry of Finance  National budget was increasing rapidly before the financial crisis  about 8 billion dollars each year for the interval of time 2005–2009  The national defense budget was around 2 38% of the GDP and was estimated at US$4 78 billion for 2008   2 2  Economic growth  GDP growth reached 8 3% in 2006 according to the statistical office of the Romania  the year to year growth amounted to unexpected 9 8% in the 3rd quarter of 2006 and stayed high at 9 5% year to year change in the 4th quarter of 2006   and 8 0% in 2007  Table showing selected PPP GDPs and growth – 2007 to 2014 estimations  as of October 2013   Romania s Gross Domestic Product at purchasing power parity  PPP  is predicted to stand at $16 982 323 per capita in 2015  when the country is expected to join the Eurozone  If this estimation proves correct  Romania will surpass Turkey  Bulgaria and Venezuela in this aspect   2 3  Growing middle class  Romania has growing middle and upper classes with relatively high per capita incomes  World Bank estimated that in 2002 99% of the urban and 94% of the rural population had access to electricity  In 2004  91% of the urban and only 16% of the rural population had access to improved water supply and 94% of the urban population had access to improved sanitation  In 2007 there were about 19 5 million mobile phone users in Romania and about 7 million internet users   The net average monthly wage was 1 617 lei  €387  in March 2013 The net average monthly wage was 1 192 lei  roughly 380 USD  in March 2008  rose to 1 352 lei  430 USD  in 2009 and is expected to reach 1 819 lei  570 USD  by 2013  The income from salaries in Romania had the highest growth rate in the region during 2006  Despite recent growth Romania still has the lowest net average monthly wage in the European Union   3  Currency  The leu  pronounced    plural  lei     ISO 4217 code RON  numeric code 946  is the currency of Romania  It is subdivided into 100 bani  singular  ban   On 1 July 2005  Romania underwent a currency reform  switching from the previous leu  ROL  to a new leu  RON   1 RON is equal to 10 000 ROL  Romania joined the European Union on 1 January 2007 and initially hoped to adopt the euro in 2014  but with the deepening of the Euro crisis and with its own problems  such as a low workforce productivity  postponed its adoption plans indefinitely   3 1  The fulfillment of the Maastricht criteria  Romania  as a member state of the European Union is liable for the adoption of the common European currency  the Euro  For this reason Romania must fulfill the Maastricht criteria  Romania meets 5 out of the 7 criteria   4  Natural resources  Romania is an oil producer  but the current level of production is not enough to make the country self sufficient  Although at one time it was Europe s largest producer of oil  most of its reserves were used and squandered during the Nicolae Ceauşescu period  As a result  it is today a net oil and gas importer   The pipeline network in Romania included 2 427 km for crude oil  3 850 km for petroleum products  and 3 508 km for natural gas in 2006  Several major new pipelines are planned  especially the Nabucco Pipeline for Caspian oilfields  the longest one in the world  Romania could cash in four billion dollars from the Constanta Trieste pipeline   Romania has considerable natural resources for a country of its size  including coal  iron ore  copper  chromium  uranium  antimony  mercury  gold  barite  borate  celestine  strontium   emery  feldspar  limestone  magnesite  marble  perlite  pumice  pyrites  sulfur   clay  arable land and hydropower   Romania s mineral production is adequate to supply its manufacturing output  Energy needs are also met by importing bituminous and anthracite coal and crude petroleum  In 2007 approximately 34 million tons of coal  approximately 4 000 tons of tungsten  565 000 tons of iron ore  and 47 000 tons of zinc ore were mined  Lesser amounts of copper  lead  molybdenum  gold  silver  kaolin  and fluorite also were mined   4 1  Energy  The energy sector is dominated by state owned companies such as Termoelectrica  Hidroelectrica and Nuclearelectrica  Fossil fuels are the country s primary source of energy  followed by hydroelectric power  Due to dependency on oil and gas imports from Russia  the country has placed an increasingly heavy emphasis on nuclear energy since the 1980s  The Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant is currently the only one of its kind in Romania  although there are plans to build a second one in Transylvania  possibly after 2020   For domestic heating cooking a large number  48% of rural and small town households use directly burned solid fuel  almost exclusively domestically produced wood  as the main energy source    www cleancookstoves org countries middle east and europe romania html  Wind power had an installed capacity of 76 MW in 2008  and the country has the largest wind power potential in Southeast Europe  with Dobruja listed as the second best place in Europe to construct wind farms  As a result  there are currently investor connection requests for over 12 000 MW  There are also plans to build a number of solar power stations  such as the Covaci Solar Park  which will be one of the largest in the world   Of the electricity generated in 2007  13 1 percent came from nuclear plants then in operation  41 69 percent from thermal plants  oil and coal   and 25 8 percent from hydroelectric sites   5  Physical infrastructure  The volume of traffic in Romania  especially goods transportation  has increased in recent years due to its strategic location in South East Europe  In the past few decades  much of the freight traffic shifted from rail to road  A further strong increase of traffic is expected in the future   As of December 2012  there are only 527 km of motorways in use  At present 369 km of motorways are under construction with an estimated timetable in 2013 2016  The railway network  which was significantly expanded during the Communist years  is the fourth largest in Europe   Bucharest is the only city in Romania which as of 2009 has an underground railway system  comprising both the Bucharest Metro and the light rail system managed by Regia Autonomă de Transport Bucureşti  Although construction was planned to begin in 1941  due to geo political factors  the Bucharest Metro was only opened in 1979  Now it is one of the most accessed systems of the Bucharest public transport network with an average ridership of 800 000 passengers during the workweek  In total  the network is 67 km long and has 49 stations   6  Sectors of the economy  6 1  Agriculture  Agriculture employs about 29% of the population  one of the highest rates in Europe   and contributes about 8 1% of GDP  The Bărăgan is characterized by large wheat farms  Dairy products  pork  poultry  and apple production are concentrated in the western region   Beef production is located in central Romania  while the production of fruits  vegetables  and wine ranges from central to southern Romania  Romania is a large producer of many agricultural products and is currently expanding its forestry and fishery industries  The implementation of the reforms and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT  have resulted in reforms in the agricultural sector of the economy   6 1 1  Fishing  Fishing is an economic mainstay in parts of the East of Romania and along the Black Sea coast  with important fish markets in places such as Constanta and Galati  Fish such as herring  crab  lobster  haddock and cod are landed at ports such as Constanta   There has been a large scale decrease in employment in the fishing industry within Romania due to the EU s Common Fisheries Policy  which places restrictions on the total tonnage of catch that can be landed  caused by overfishing in the Black Sea  In tandem with the decline of sea fishing  commercial fish farms – especially in salmon  have increased in prominence in the rivers and lochs of the east of Romania  Inland waters are rich in fresh water fish such as salmon  trout  and in particular  carp  which traditionally has been the most popular fish  including its eggs  icre   fresh or canned   6 2  Industry  Romania has been successful in developing its industrial sector in recent years  Industry and construction accounted for 32% of gross domestic product  GDP  in 2003  a comparatively large share even without taking into account related services  The sector employed 26 4% of the workforce  Romania excels in the production of automobiles  machine tools  and chemicals  In 2013  some 410 997 automobiles were produced in Romania  up from 78 165 in 2000   In 2004 Romania enjoyed one of the largest world market share in machine tools  5 3%   Romanian based companies such as Dacia  Petrom  Rompetrol  Bitdefender  Romstal and Mobexpert have expanded operations throughout the region  However  small  to medium sized manufacturing firms form the bulk of Romania s industrial sector   Romania s industrial output is expected to advance 9% in 2007  while agriculture output is projected to grow 12%  Final consumption is also expected to increase by 11% overall – individual consumption by 14 4% and collective consumption by 10 4%  Domestic demand is expected to go up 12 7%   Industrial output growth was 6 9% year on year in December 2009  making it the highest in the EU 27 zone which averaged −1 9%   6 3  Services  In 2003 service sector constituted 55% of gross domestic product  GDP   and the sector employed 51 3% of the workforce  The subcomponents of services are financial  renting  and business activities  20 5%   trade  hotels and restaurants  and transport  18%   and other service activities  21 7%   The service sector in Romania has expanded in recent years  employing some 47% of Romanians and accounting for slightly more than half of GDP   The largest employer is the retail sector  employing almost 12% of Romanians  The retail industry is mainly concentrated in a relatively small number of chain stores clustered together in shopping malls  In recent years the rise of big box stores  such as Cora  hypermarket   of the France  and Carrefour  a subsidiary of the French   have led to fewer workers in this sector and a migration of retail jobs to the suburbs   7  Regional variation  The strength of the Romanian economy varies from region to region  GDP  and GDP per capita is highest in Bucharest  The following table shows the GDP  2005  per capita of the 4 counties and 2 areas  with data supplied by Eurostat   The highest GDP per capita is found in Bucharest and surrounding Ilfov County  Values well above the national average are found in Timiş  Argeş  Braşov  Cluj  Constanţa  Sibiu and Prahova  Values well below the national average are found in  Vaslui  Botoşani  Călăraşi  Neamţ  Vrancea  Suceava  Giurgiu  Mehedinţi  Olt and Teleorman   8  Foreign trade  Italy is Romania s largest trading partner  two way trade totalled some $22 6 billion in 2007  The principal exports from Italy to Romania include computers  integrated circuits  aircraft parts and other defense equipment  wheat  and automobiles  along with remittances  Romania s chief exports to Italy include cut diamonds  jewelry  integrated circuits  printing machinery  and telecommunications equipment  2 8% of the country s GDP is derived from Agricultural activity  While Romania imports substantial quantities of grain  it is largely self sufficient in other agricultural products and food stuffs  due to the fact that food must be regulated for sale in the Romania retail market  and hence imports almost no food products from other countries   Romania imported in 2006 food products of 2 4 billion euros  up almost 20% versus 2005  when the imports were worth slightly more than 2 billion euros  The EU is Romania s main partner in the trade with agri food products  The exports to this destination represent 64%  and the imports from the EU countries represent 54%  Other important partners are the CEFTA countries  Turkey  Republic of Moldova and the USA  Despite a decline of the arms industry in the post communist era  Romania is a significant exporter of military equipment  accounting for 3–4% of the world total in 2007  EU members are represented by a single official at the World Trade Organization   During the first trimester of 2010  Romanian exports increased by 21%  one of the largest rates in the European Union  surpassed only by Malta  The trade deficit currently stands at roughly 2 billion EUR  the eighth largest in the EU   9  Miscellaneous data  Households with access to fixed and mobile telephone access  landline telephone – 46%  2009   mobile telephone – 72%  2009  Broadband penetration rate  13%  2010
