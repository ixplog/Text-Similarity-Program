origins and celebrations  The earliest May Day celebrations appeared in pre Christian times  with the Floralia  festival of Flora  the Roman goddess of flowers  held April 27 during the Roman Republic era  and with the Walpurgis Night celebrations of the Germanic countries  It is also associated with the Gaelic Beltane  most commonly held on April 30  The day was a traditional summer holiday in many pre Christian European pagan cultures  While February 1 was the first day of Spring  May 1 was the first day of summer  hence  the summer solstice on June 25  now June 21  was Midsummer   As Europe became Christianised  the pagan holidays lost their religious character and May Day changed into a popular secular celebration  A significant celebration of May Day occurs in Germany where it is one of several days on which St  Walburga  credited with bringing Christianity to Germany  is celebrated  The secular versions of May Day  observed in Europe and America  may be best known for their traditions of dancing around the maypole and crowning the Queen of May  Fading in popularity since the late 20th century is the giving of  May baskets   small baskets of sweets or flowers  usually left anonymously on neighbors  doorsteps   Since the 18th Century  many Roman Catholics have observed May — and May Day — with various May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary In works of art  school skits  and so forth  Mary s head will often be adorned with flowers in a May crowning  May 1st is also one of two feast days of the Catholic patron saint of workers St Joseph the Worker  a carpenter  husband to Mother Mary  and surrogate father of Jesus  Replacing another feast to St  Joseph  this date was chosen by the Pope Pius XII in 1955 to create as a counterpoint to the Communist

fashionable since the 1970s  possibly due to the presence of television cameras  In recent years  the bridge has been closed on 1 May to prevent people from jumping  as the water under the bridge is

political or social declarations  During the height of the communist influence in the Valley between the wars  large and small red flags were carried by hand  attached to bicycles  or baby carriages   Although May Day was big in Drumheller  it was not universally loved   especially by law enforcement  On more than one occasion  mounted police were ordered  on horseback  to forcibly confiscate Red Banners and any pro labour placards   Drumheller’s Miners’ Day was also an opportunity for picnic speeches  Labour organisers such as Kid Burns  Slim Evans  and Pat Lenihan gave fiery speeches  often in Newcastle  as hundreds eagerly listened and picnicked  The police  out in force but often in dress uniform watched on from a short distance   The day wasn’t complete without ice cream  contests  dances  sports  and games  Some of the events were held at Newcastle Park  some downtown  Everyone who worked at the mines had the day off  and it became an unofficial school holiday too   “I can recall the coal loading contests  climbing the greasy pole for the big ham that was tied to the top  releasing a greased pig amongst the huge throng of miners and their families  the games of quoits and the horseshoes  playing cricket  and the bagpipes ” Ido Michielin  Drumheller Valley Coal Miner   Drumheller’s Miners’ Day disappeared in the 1950’s  but was revived for the Valley’s Mining
