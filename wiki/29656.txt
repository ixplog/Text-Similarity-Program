on August 12  2014   1  Early life  Ballmer was born in Detroit  the son of Beatrice Dworkin and Frederic Henry Ballmer  a manager at the Ford Motor Company  His father was a Swiss immigrant  and his mother was Jewish  her family was from Belarus   Ballmer grew up in the affluent community of Farmington Hills  Michigan  In 1973  he attended college prep and engineering classes at Lawrence Technological University  He graduated from Detroit Country Day School  a private college preparatory school in Beverly Hills  Michigan  with a perfect score of 800 on the mathematical section of the SAT and was a National Merit Scholar  He now sits on the school s board of directors  In 1977  he graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College with an A B  in applied mathematics and economics   At

Business to join Microsoft   2  History with Microsoft  Steve Ballmer joined Microsoft on June 11  1980  and became Microsoft s 30th employee  the first business manager hired by Gates   Ballmer was initially offered a salary of $50 000 as well as a percentage of ownership of the company  When Microsoft was incorporated in 1981  Ballmer owned 8 percent of the company  In 2003  Ballmer sold 8 3% of his shareholdings  leaving him with a 4% stake in the company  The same year  Ballmer replaced Microsoft s employee stock options program   In the 20 years following his hire  Ballmer headed several Microsoft divisions  including operations  operating systems development  and sales and support  From February 1992 onwards  he was Executive Vice President  Sales and Support  Ballmer led Microsoft s development of the  NET Framework  Ballmer was then promoted to President of Microsoft  a title that he held from July 1998 to February 2001  making him the de facto number two in the company to the Chairman and CEO  Bill Gates   2 1  Chief Executive Officer  In January 2000  Ballmer was officially named Chief Executive Officer  As CEO  Ballmer handled company finances and daily operations  but Gates remained chairman of the board and still retained control of the  technological vision  as chief software architect  Gates relinquished day to day activities when he stepped down as chief software architect in 2006  while staying on as chairman  and that gave Ballmer the autonomy needed to make major management changes at Microsoft   When Ballmer took over as CEO  the company was fighting an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the U S  government and 20 states  plus class action lawsuits and complaints from rival companies  While it was said that Gates would have continued fighting the suit  Ballmer made it his priority to settle these saying  Being the object of a lawsuit  effectively  or a complaint from your government is a very awkward  uncomfortable position to be in  It just has all downside  People assume if the government brought a complaint that there s really a problem  and your ability to say we re a good  proper  moral place is tough  It s actually tough  even though you feel that way about yourselves    Upon becoming CEO  Ballmer required detailed business justification in order to approve of new products  rather than allowing hundreds of products that sounded potentially interesting or trendy  In 2005  he recruited B  Kevin Turner from Wal Mart Stores  where he was executive vice president  to become Microsoft s chief operating officer to add  scorecards  for measuring customer satisfaction and other key sales metrics   Since Bill Gates  retirement  Ballmer oversaw a  dramatic shift away from the company s PC first heritage   replacing most major division heads in order to break down the  talent hoarding fiefdoms   and Businessweek said that the company  arguably now has the best product lineup in its history   Ballmer was instrumental in driving Microsoft s cloud computing strategy  with acquisitions such as Skype   Under Ballmer s tenure as CEO  Microsoft s annual revenue surged from $25 billion to $70 billion  while its net income increased 215 percent to $23 billion  and its gross profit of 75 cents on every dollar in sales is double that of Google or International Business Machines Corp  In terms of leading the company s total annual profit growth  Ballmer s tenure at Microsoft  16 4 percent  surpassed the performances of other well known CEOs such as General Electric s Jack Welch  11 2 percent  and IBM s Louis V  Gerstner  Jr   2 percent   These gains came from the existing Windows and Office franchises  with Ballmer maintaining their profitability  fending off threats from cheaper competitors such as GNU Linux and other open source operating systems and Google Docs  Ballmer also built half a dozen new businesses such as the data centers division  $6 6 billion in profit for 2011  and the Xbox entertainment and devices division  $8 9 billion   which has prevented the Sony PlayStation and other gaming consoles from undermining Windows   and oversaw the acquisition of Skype  Ballmer also constructed the company s $20 billion Enterprise Business  consisting of new products and services such as Exchange  Windows Server  SQL Server  SharePoint  System Center  and Dynamics CRM  each of which initially faced an uphill battle for acceptance but have emerged as leading or dominant in each category  This diversified product mix helped to offset the company s reliance on PCs and mobile computing devices as the company entered the Post PC era  in reporting quarterly results during April 2013  while Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 had not managed to increase their market share above single digits  the company increased its profit 19 percent over the previous quarter in 2012  as the Microsoft Business Division  including Office 365  and Server and Tools division  cloud services  are each larger than the Windows division   Ballmer attracted criticism for failing to capitalize on several new consumer technologies  forcing Microsoft to play catch up in the areas of tablet computing  smartphones and music players with mixed results  Under Ballmer s watch   In many cases  Microsoft latched onto technologies like smartphones  touchscreens   smart  cars and wristwatches that read sports scores aloud long before Apple or Google did  But it repeatedly killed promising projects if they threatened its cash cows  Windows and Office     Microsoft s share price stagnated during Ballmer s tenure  As a result  in May 2012  hedge fund manager David Einhorn called on Ballmer to step down as CEO of Microsoft   His continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft s stock   Einhorn said in reference to Ballmer  In a May 2012 column in Forbes magazine  Adam Hartung described Ballmer as  the worst CEO of a large publicly traded American company   saying he had  steered Microsoft out of some of the fastest growing and most lucrative tech markets  mobile music  handsets and tablets     In 2009  and for the first time since Bill Gates resigned from day to day management at Microsoft  Ballmer delivered the opening keynote at CES   On June 19  2012  Ballmer revealed Microsoft s new tablet device called Microsoft Surface at an event held in Hollywood  Los Angeles   On August 23  2013  Microsoft announced that Ballmer would retire within the next 12 months  A special committee that included Bill Gates would decide on the next CEO   There was a list of potential successors to Ballmer as Microsoft CEO  but all had departed the company  Jim Allchin  Brad Silverberg  Paul Maritz  Nathan Myhrvold  Greg Maffei  Pete Higgins  Jeff Raikes  J  Allard  Robbie Bach  Bill Veghte  Ray Ozzie  Bob Muglia and Steven Sinofsky  B  Kevin Turner  Microsoft s Chief Operating Officer  COO   was considered by some to be a de facto number two to Ballmer  with Turner having a strong grasp of business and operations but lacking technological vision  On February 4  2014  Satya Nadella succeeded Ballmer as CEO   Ballmer has also served as director of Accenture Ltd  and a general partner of Accenture SCA since October 2001   2 2  Persona  Ballmer is known for his energetic and exuberant persona  which is meant to motivate employees and partners  His flamboyant stage appearances at Microsoft events are widely circulated on the Internet as viral videos   A widely circulated video  captured at a developers  conference  features a perspiring Ballmer chanting the word  developers   At the MIX 08 event on March 6  2008  during a question and answer interview with Guy Kawasaki  one person from the public requested Ballmer to do a  web developers  chant  mirroring the  developers  chant he had done around eight years before  Ballmer screamed  I ve been in PR mode the whole time  and you want to hear web developers  web developers  web developers    receiving a round of applause from the audience   2 3  Relationship with Bill Gates  The Wall Street Journal has reported that there was tension surrounding the 2000 transition of authority from Bill Gates to Ballmer  Things became so bitter that  on one occasion  Gates stormed out of a meeting in a huff after a shouting match in which Ballmer jumped to the defense of several colleagues  according to an individual present at the time  After the exchange  Ballmer seemed  remorseful   the person said  Once Gates leaves   I m not going to need him for anything  That s the principle   Ballmer said   Use him  yes  need him  no    In October 2014  a Vanity Fair profile stated that Ballmer and Gates no longer talk due to bad blood over Ballmer s resignation   2 4  Retirement  After saying in 2008 that he intended to remain CEO for another decade  Ballmer announced his retirement in 2013  after losing billions of dollars in acquisitions and on the Surface tablet  Microsoft s stock price rebounded on the news   Ballmer says that he regretted the lack of focus on Windows Mobile in the early 2000s  leaving Microsoft a distant third in the current smartphone market   Ballmer hosted his last company meeting in September 2013   Ballmer stepped down from the company Board of Directors in August 2014   On December 24  2014  the Seattle Times reported that the IRS sued Ballmer  Craig Mundie  Jeff Raikes  Jim Allchin  Orlando Ayala and David Guenther in an effort to compel them to testify in Microsoft’s corporate tax audit  The IRS has been looking into how Microsoft and other companies deal with transfer pricing   3  On competing companies and software  3 1  Apple  In 2007  Ballmer said  There s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share  No chance    Speaking at a conference in NYC in 2009  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer criticized Apple s pricing  saying   Now I think the tide has turned back the other direction  against Apple   The economy is helpful  Paying an extra $500 for a computer in this environment—same piece of hardware—paying $500 more to get a logo on it  I think that s a more challenging proposition for the average person than it used to be    3 2  Free and open source software  He has referred to the free software Linux kernel as a  cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches   Ballmer used the notion of  viral  licensing terms to express his concern over the fact that the GNU General Public License  GPL  employed by such software requires that all derivative software be under the GPL or a compatible license   3 3  Google  In 2005  Microsoft sued Google for hiring one of its previous vice presidents  Kai Fu Lee  claiming it was in violation of his one year non compete clause in his contract  Mark Lucovsky  who left for Google in 2004  alleged in a sworn statement to a Washington state court that Ballmer became enraged upon hearing that Lucovsky was about to leave Microsoft for Google  picked up his chair  and threw it across his office  and that  referring to Google CEO Eric Schmidt  who previously worked for competitors Sun and Novell   Ballmer vowed to  kill Google   Lucovsky reports   Ballmer then resumed attempting to persuade Lucovsky to stay at Microsoft  Ballmer has described Lucovsky s account of the incident as a  gross exaggeration of what actually took place    During the 2011 Web 2 0 Summit in San Francisco  he said   You don t need to be a computer scientist to use a Windows Phone and you do to use an Android phone     It is hard for me to be excited about the Android phones    4  Sports  On March 6  2008  Seattle mayor Greg Nickels announced that a local ownership group involving Ballmer made a  game changing  commitment to invest $150 million in cash toward a proposed $300 million renovation of KeyArena and were ready to purchase the Seattle SuperSonics from the Professional Basketball Club LLC in order to keep the team in Seattle  However  this initiative failed  and the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City  Oklahoma  where they now play as the Oklahoma City Thunder   In June 2012
