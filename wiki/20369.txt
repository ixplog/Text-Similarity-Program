Mitosis is the cell cycle process by which chromosomes in a cell nucleus are separated into two identical sets of chromosomes  each in its own nucleus  In general  karyokinesis  division of the nucleus  is followed by cytokinesis  which divides the cytoplasm  organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components  Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic  M  phase of the cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells  genetically identical to each other and to their parent cell   The process of mitosis is fast and highly complex  The sequence of events is divided into stages corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next  These stages are prophase  prometaphase  metaphase  anaphase  and telophase  During mitosis  the chromosomes  which have already duplicated  condense and attach to fibers that pull one copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell  The cell then divides by cytokinesis to produce two genetically identical daughter cells  Errors during mitosis can induce apoptosis  programmed cell death  or cause mutations  Certain types of cancer can arise from such mutations   Mitosis occurs only in eukaryotic cells and the process varies in different organisms  For example  animals undergo an  open  mitosis  where the nuclear envelope breaks down before the chromosomes separate  while fungi undergo a  closed  mitosis  where chromosomes divide within an intact cell nucleus  Prokaryotic cells  which lack a nucleus  divide by a different process called binary fission   1  Discovery  German zoologist Otto Bütschli was one of the first researchers who might have claimed the discovery of the process presently known as  mitosis   a term coined by Walther Flemming in 1882   Mitosis was discovered in frog  rabbit  and cat cornea cells in 1873 and described for the first time by the Polish histologist Wacław Mayzel in 1875  The term is derived from the Greek word μίτος mitos  warp thread    2  Overview of mitosis  The primary result of mitosis and cytokinesis is the transfer of a parent cell s genome into two daughter cells  The genome is composed of a number of chromosomes—complexes of tightly coiled DNA that contain genetic information vital for proper cell function  Because each resultant daughter cell should be genetically identical to the parent cell  the parent cell must make a copy of each chromosome before mitosis  This occurs during the S phase of interphase  Chromosome duplication results in two identical sister chromatids bound together by cohesin proteins at the centromere   When mitosis begins  the chromosomes condense and become visible  In most eukaryotes  the nuclear envelope  which segregates the DNA from the cytoplasm  disintegrates into small vesicles  The nucleolus  which makes ribosomes in the cell  also disappears  Microtubules project from opposite ends of the cell  attach to the centromeres  and align the chromosomes centrally within the cell  The microtubules then contract to pull the sister chromatids of each chromosome apart  Sister chromatids at this point are called daughter chromosomes  As the cell elongates  corresponding daughter chromosomes are pulled toward opposite ends of the cell  A new nuclear envelope forms around the separated daughter chromosomes   As mitosis concludes  the cell begins cytokinesis  In animal cells  the cell membrane pinches inward between the two developing nuclei to produce two new cells  In plant cells  a cell plate forms between the two nuclei   3  Phases of cell cycle and mitosis  3 1  Interphase  The mitotic phase is a relatively short period of the cell cycle  It alternates with the much longer interphase  where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division  Interphase is divided into three phases  G1  first gap   S  synthesis   and G2  second gap   During all three phases  the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles  However  chromosomes are replicated only during the S phase  Thus  a cell grows  G1   continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes  S   grows more and prepares for mitosis  G2   and finally divides  M  before restarting the cycle  All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins  cyclin dependent kinases  and other cell cycle proteins  The phases follow one another in strict order and there are  checkpoints  that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to another  Cells may also temporarily or permanently leave the cell cycle and enter G0 phase to stop dividing  This can occur when cells become overcrowded  density dependent inhibition  or when they differentiate to carry out specific functions for the organism  as is the case for human heart muscle cells and neurons  Some G0 cells have the ability to re enter the cell cycle   3 2  Preprophase  plant cells   In plant cells only  prophase is preceded by a pre prophase stage  In highly vacuolated plant cells  the nucleus has to migrate into the center of the cell before mitosis can begin  This is achieved through the formation of a phragmosome  a transverse sheet of cytoplasm that bisects the cell along the future plane of cell division  In addition to phragmosome formation  preprophase is characterized by the formation of a ring of microtubules and actin filaments  called preprophase band  underneath the plasma membrane around the equatorial plane of the future mitotic spindle  This band marks the position where the cell will eventually divide  The cells of higher plants  such as the flowering plants  lack centrioles  instead  microtubules form a spindle on the surface of the nucleus and are then organized into a spindle by the chromosomes themselves  after the nuclear envelope breaks down  The preprophase band disappears during nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle formation in prometaphase   3 3  Prophase  During prophase  which occurs after G2 interphase  the cell prepares to divide by tightly condensing its chromosomes and initiating mitotic spindle formation  During interphase  the genetic material in the nucleus consists of loosely packed chromatin  At the onset of prophase  chromatin fibers condense into discrete chromosomes that are typically visible at high magnification through a light microscope  The nucleolus also disappears during early prophase  Close to the nucleus of animal cells are structures called centrosomes  consisting of a pair of centrioles surrounded by a loose collection of proteins  The centrosome is the coordinating center for the cell s microtubules  A cell inherits a single centrosome at cell division  which is duplicated by the cell before a new round of mitosis begins  giving a pair of centrosomes  The two centrosomes polymerize tubulin to help form a microtuble spindle apparatus  Motor proteins then push the centrosomes along these microtubules to opposite sides of the cell  Although centrosomes help organize microtubule assembly  they are not essential for the formation of the spindle apparatus  since they are absent from plants  and are not absolutely required for animal cell mitosis   3 4  Prometaphase  At the beginning of prometaphase  phosphorylation of nuclear lamins causes the nuclear envelope to disintegrate into small membrane vesicles  As this happens  microtubules invade the nuclear space  This is called open mitosis  and it occurs in most multicellular organisms  Fungi and some protists  such as algae or trichomonads  undergo a variation called closed mitosis where the spindle forms inside the nucleus  or the microtubules penetrate the intact nuclear envelope   In late prometaphase  kinetochore microtubules begin to search for and attach to chromosomal kinetochores  A kinetochore is a proteinaceous microtubule binding structure that forms on the chromosomal centromere during late prophase  A number of polar microtubules find and interact with corresponding polar microtubules from the opposite centrosome to form the mitotic spindle  Although the kinetochore structure and function are not fully understood  it is known that it contains some form of molecular motor  When a microtubule connects with the kinetochore  the motor activates  using energy from ATP to  crawl  up the tube toward the originating centrosome  This motor activity  coupled with polymerisation and depolymerisation of microtubules  provides the pulling force necessary to later separate the chromosome s two chromatids   3 5  Metaphase  After the microtubules have located and attached to the kinetochores in prometaphase  the two centrosomes begin pulling the chromosomes towards opposite ends of the cell  The resulting tension causes the chromosomes to align along the metaphase plate or equatorial plane  an imaginary line that is centrally located between the two centrosomes  at approximately the midline of the cell   To ensure equitable distribution of chromosomes at the end of mitosis  the metaphase checkpoint guarantees that kinetochores are properly attached to the mitotic spindle and that the chromosomes are aligned along the metaphase plate  If the cell successfully passes through the metaphase checkpoint  it proceeds to anaphase   3 6  Anaphase  During anaphase A  the cohesins that bind sister chromatids together are cleaved  forming two identical daughter chromosomes  Shortening of the kinetochore microtubules pulls the newly formed daughter chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell  During anaphase B  polar microtubules push against each other  causing the cell to elongate  In most animal cells  anaphase A precedes anaphase B  but some vertebrate egg cells demonstrate the opposite order of events   3 7  Telophase  Telophase  from the Greek word τελος meaning  end   is a reversal of prophase and prometaphase events  At telophase  the polar microtubules continue to lengthen  elongating the cell even more  A new nuclear envelope  using the membrane vesicles of the parent cell s old nuclear envelope  forms around each set of separated daughter chromosomes  though the membrane does not enclose the centrosomes  and the nucleolus reappears  Both sets of chromosomes  now surrounded by new nuclear membrane  begin to  relax  or decondense  Mitosis is complete  but cell division is not   3 8  Cytokinesis  Cytokinesis is not  in the technical sense  a phase of mitosis but rather a separate process  necessary for completing cell division  In animal cells  a cleavage furrow  pinch  containing a contractile ring develops where the metaphase plate used to be  pinching off the separated nuclei  In both animal and plant cells  cell division is also driven by vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus  which move along microtubules to the middle of the cell  In plants  this structure coalesces into a cell plate at the center of the phragmoplast and develops into a cell wall  separating the two nuclei  The phragmoplast is a microtubule structure typical for higher plants  whereas some green algae use a phycoplast microtubule array during cytokinesis  Each daughter cell has a complete copy of the genome of its parent cell  The end of cytokinesis marks the end of the M phase   There are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately  forming single cells with multiple nuclei  The most notable occurrence of this is among the fungi and slime molds  but the phenomenon is found in various organisms  Even in animals  cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently  for instance during certain stages of fruit fly embryonic development   4  Significance  Mitosis is important for the maintenance of the chromosomal set  each cell formed receives chromosomes that are alike in composition and equal in number to the chromosomes of the parent cell   Mitosis occurs in the following circumstances   Development and growth  The number of cells within an organism increases by mitosis  This is the basis of the development of a multicellular body from a single cell  i e   zygote and also the basis of the growth of a multicellular body    Cell replacement  In some parts of body  e g  skin and digestive tract  cells are constantly sloughed off and replaced by new ones  New cells are formed by mitosis and so are exact copies of the cells being replaced  In like manner  red blood cells have short lifespan  only about 4 months  and new RBCs are formed by mitosis    Regeneration  Some organisms can regenerate body parts  The production of new cells in such instances is achieved by mitosis  For example  starfish regenerate lost arms through mitosis    Asexual reproduction  Some organisms produce genetically similar offspring through asexual reproduction  For example  the hydra reproduces asexually by budding  The cells at the surface of hydra undergo mitosis and form a mass called a bud  Mitosis continues in the cells of the bud and this grows into a new individual  The same division happens during asexual reproduction or vegetative propagation in plants   5  Errors and variations of mitosis  Errors can occur during mitosis  especially during early embryonic development in humans  Mitotic errors can create aneuploid cells that have too few or too many of one or more chromosomes  a condition associated with cancer   In nondisjunction  sister chromatids fail to separate during anaphase  One daughter cell receives both sister chromatids from the nondisjoining chromosome and the other cell receives none  As a result  the former cell gets three copies of the chromosome  a condition known as trisomy  and the latter will have only one copy  a condition known as monosomy  On occasion  when cells experience nondisjunction  they fail to complete cytokinesis and retain both nuclei in one cell  resulting in binucleated cells   Anaphase lag occurs when the movement of one chromatid is impeded during anaphase  This may be caused by a failure of the mitotic spindle to properly attach to the chromosome  The lagging chromatid is excluded from both nuclei and is lost  Therefore  one of the daughter cells will be monosomic for that chromosome   Endoreduplication  or endoreplication  occurs when chromosomes duplicate but the cell does not subsequently divide  This results in polyploid cells or  if the chromosomes duplicates repeatedly  polytene chromosomes  Endoreduplication is found in many species and appears to be a normal part of development  Endomitosis is a variant of endoreduplication in which cells replicate their chromosomes during S phase and enter  but prematurely terminate  mitosis  Instead of being divided into two new daughter nuclei  the replicated chromosomes are retained within the original nucleus  The cells then re enter G1 and S phase and replicate their chromosomes again  This may occur multiple times  increasing the chromosome number with each round of replication and endomitosis  Platelet producing megakaryocytes go through endomitosis during cell differentiation   6  Timeline in pictures  Mitotic cells can be visualized microscopically by staining them with fluorescent antibodies and dyes   7  See also  Aneuploidy  Binary fission  Chromosome abnormality  Cytoskeleton  Meiosis  Mitogen  Mitosis Promoting Factor  Motor protein  8  References  9  Cited texts  10
