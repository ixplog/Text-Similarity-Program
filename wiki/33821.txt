A whistleblower  whistle blower or whistle blower  is a person who exposes misconduct  alleged dishonest or illegal activity occurring in an organization  The alleged misconduct may be classified in many ways  for example  a violation of a law  rule  regulation and or a direct threat to public interest  such as fraud  health and safety violations  and corruption  Whistleblowers may make their allegations internally  for example  to other people within the accused organization  or externally  to regulators  law enforcement agencies  to the media or to groups concerned with the issues    Whistleblowers frequently face reprisal  sometimes at the hands of the organization or group which they have accused  sometimes from related organizations  and sometimes under law   Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing  the moral responsibility of whistleblowing  and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of political ethics   1  Overview  1 1  Origin of term  The term whistle blower comes from the whistle a referee uses to indicate an illegal or foul play  US civic activist Ralph Nader coined the phrase in the early 1970s to avoid the negative connotations found in other words such as  informers  and  snitches    1 2  Internal  Most whistleblowers are internal whistleblowers  who report misconduct on a fellow employee or superior within their company  One of the most interesting questions with respect to internal whistleblowers is why and under what circumstances people will either act on the spot to stop illegal and otherwise unacceptable behavior or report it  There are some reason to believe that people are more likely to take action with respect to unacceptable behavior  within an organization  if there are complaint systems that offer not just options dictated by the planning and control organization  but a choice of options for absolute confidentiality   1 3  External  External whistleblowers  however  report misconduct to outside persons or entities  In these cases  depending on the information s severity and nature  whistleblowers may report the misconduct to lawyers  the media  law enforcement or watchdog agencies  or other local  state  or federal agencies  In some cases  external whistleblowing is encouraged by offering monetary reward  This is  however  an act of treason if one has signed non disclosure agreements   1 4  Third party  The third party service involves utilising an external agency to inform the individuals at the top of the organisational pyramid of misconduct  without disclosing the identity of the whistleblower  This is a relatively new phenomenon and has been developed due to whistleblower discrimination  International Whistleblowers is an example of an organisation involved in delivering a third party service for whistleblowers   2  Common reactions  Whistleblowers are sometimes seen as selfless martyrs for public interest and organizational accountability  others view them as  traitors  or  defectors   Some even accuse them of solely pursuing personal glory and fame  or view their behavior as motivated by greed in qui tam cases  Some academics  such as Thomas Alured Faunce  feel that whistleblowers should at least be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are attempting to apply ethical principles in the face of obstacles and that whistleblowing would be more respected in governance systems if it had a firmer academic basis in virtue ethics   It is probable that many people do not even consider blowing the whistle  not only because of fear of retaliation  but also because of fear of losing their relationships at work and outside work   Persecution of whistleblowers has become a serious issue in many parts of the world   Employees in academia  business or government might become aware of serious risks to health and the environment  but internal policies might pose threats of retaliation to those who report these early warnings  Private company employees in particular might be at risk of being fired  demoted  denied raises and so on for bringing environmental risks to the attention of appropriate authorities  Government employees could be at a similar risk for bringing threats to health or the environment to public attention  although perhaps this is less likely  There are examples of  early warning scientists  being harassed for bringing inconvenient truths about impending harm to the notice of the public and authorities  There have also been cases of young scientists being discouraged from entering controversial scientific fields for fear of harassment   Although whistleblowers are often protected under law from employer retaliation  there have been many cases where punishment for whistleblowing has occurred  such as termination  suspension  demotion  wage garnishment  and or harsh mistreatment by other employees  For example  in the United States  most whistleblower protection laws provide for limited  make whole  remedies or damages for employment losses if whistleblower retaliation is proven  However  many whistleblowers report there exists a widespread  shoot the messenger  mentality by corporations or government agencies accused of misconduct and in some cases whistleblowers have been subjected to criminal prosecution in reprisal for reporting wrongdoing   As a reaction to this many private organizations have formed whistleblower legal defense funds or support groups to assist whistleblowers  three such examples are the National Whistleblowers Center in the United States  Whistleblowers UK and Public Concern at Work  PCaW  in the United Kingdom  Depending on the circumstances  it is not uncommon for whistleblowers to be ostracized by their co workers  discriminated against by future potential employers  or even fired from their organization  This campaign directed at whistleblowers with the goal of eliminating them from the organization is referred to as mobbing  It is an extreme form of workplace bullying wherein the group is set against the targeted individual   2 1  Psychiatric reprisals  Whistle blowers who part ranks with their organizations have had their mental stability questioned  such as  for example  the NYPD veteran who alleged falsified crime statistics in his department and was forcibly committed to a mental institution   3  Legal protection  Legal protection for whistleblowing varies from country to country and may depend on any of the country of the original activity  where and how secrets were revealed  and how they eventually became published or publicized  Over a dozen countries have now adopted comprehensive whistleblower protection laws which create mechanisms for reporting  investigate reports  and provide legal protections to the people who informed them  Over 50 countries have adopted more limited protections as part of their anti corruption  freedom of information  or employment laws  For purposes of the English Wikipedia  this section emphasizes the English speaking world and covers other regimes only insofar as they represent exceptionally greater or lesser protections   3 1  Australia  There are also laws in a number of states  The former NSW Police Commissioner Tony Lauer summed up official government and police attitudes as   Nobody in Australia much likes whistleblowers  particularly in an organisation like the police or the government   Mr Lauer s comments are clearly at odds with public support for WikiLeaks   Whistleblowers Australia is an association for those who have exposed corruption or any form of malpractice  especially if they were then hindered or abused   3 2  Canada  The provides a safe and confidential mechanism enabling public servants and the general public to disclose wrongdoings committed in the public sector  It also protects from reprisal public servants who have disclosed wrongdoing and those who have cooperated in investigations  The Office’s goal is to enhance public confidence in Canada’s federal public institutions and in the integrity of public servants   Mandated by the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act  The Act   PSIC is a permanent and independent Agent of Parliament  The Act  which came into force on April 15  2007  applies to most of the federal public sector  approximately 400 000 public servants  This includes government departments and agencies  parent Crown corporations  the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other federal public sector bodies   Not all disclosures lead to an investigation as the Act sets out the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and gives the option not to investigate under certain circumstances  On the other hand  if PSIC conducts an investigation and finds no wrongdoing was committed  the Commissioner must report his findings to the discloser and to the organization’s chief executive  Also  reports of founded wrongdoing are presented before the House of Commons and the Senate in accordance with The Act  As of June 2014  a total of 9 reports have been tabled in Parliament   The Act also established the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal  PSDPT  to protect public servants by hearing reprisal complaints referred by the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner  The Tribunal can grant remedies in favour of complainants and order disciplinary action against persons who take reprisals   PSIC’s current Commissioner is Mr  Mario Dion  Previously  he has served in various senior roles in the public service  including as Associate Deputy Minister of Justice  Executive Director and Deputy Head of the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada  and as Chair of the National Parole Board   3 3  Jamaica  In Jamaica  the Protected Disclosures Act  2011 received assent in March 2011  It creates a comprehensive system for the protection of whistleblowers in the public and private sector  It is based on the UK s Public Interest Disclosure Act   3 4  India  The Government of India has been considering adopting a whistleblower protection law for several years  In 2003  the Law Commission of India recommended the adoption of the Public Interest Disclosure  Protection of Informers  Act  2002  In August 2010  the Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill  2010 was introduced into the Lok Sabha  lower house of the Parliament of India  The Bill was approved by the cabinet in June  2011  The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill  2010 was renamed as The Whistleblowers  Protection Bill  2011 by the Standing Committee on Personnel  Public Grievances  Law and Justice  The Whistleblowers  Protection Bill  2011 was passed by the Lok Sabha on 28 December 2011  and by the Rajyasabha on 21 February 2014  The Whistle Blowers Protection Act  2011 has received the Presidential assent on May 9  2014 and the same has been subsequently published in the official gazette of the Government of India on May 9  2014 by the Ministry of Law and Justice  Government of India   3 5  Ireland  The government of Ireland committed to adopting a comprehensive whistleblower protection law in January 2012  The bill will reportedly cover both the public and private sectors   3 6  Netherlands  The Netherlands has measures in place to mitigate the risks of whistleblowing  the whistleblower advice centre  Adviespunt Klokkenluiders  offers advice to whistleblowers  and the Parliament recently passed a proposal to establish a so called house for whistleblowers  to protect them from the severe negative consequences that they might endure  Kamerstuk  2013   Dutch media organisations also provide whistleblower support  on 9 September 2013 a number of major Dutch media outlets supported the launch of   which provides a secure website for people to leak documents to the media  Publeaks is designed to protect whistleblowers  It operates on the GlobaLeaks software developed by the   which supports whistleblower oriented technologies internationally   3 7  Switzerland  The Swiss Council of States agreed on a draft amendment of the Swiss Code of Obligations in September 2014  The draft introduces articles 321abis to 321asepties  328 3   336 2  d   An amendment of article 362 1  adds articles 321abis to 321asepties to the list of provisions that may not be overruled by labour and bargaining agreements  Article 321ater introduces an obligation on employees to report irregularities to their employer before reporting to an authority  An employee will  however  not breach his duty of good faith if he reports an irregularity to an authority and  a period set by the employer and no longer than 60 days has lapsed since the employee has reported the incident to his employer  and  the employer has not addressed the irregularity or it is obvious that the employer has insufficiently addressed the irregularity  Article 321aquarter provides that an employee may exceptionally directly report to an authority  Exceptions apply in cases  where the employee is in a position to objectively demonstrate that a report to his employer will prove ineffective   where the employee has to anticipate dismissal   where the employee must assume that the competent authority will be hindered in investigating the irregularity  or  where there is a direct and serious hazard to life  to health  to safety  or to the environment  The draft does not improve on protection against dismissal for employees who report irregularities to their employer  The amendment does not provide for employees anonymously filing their observations of irregularities   3 8  United Kingdom  The United Kingdom  UK  Government s Department of Business  Innovation and Skills  BIS  initiated a Whistleblowing Commission in October 2013 to explore whether there are any other aspects of the law governing whistleblowing which may not be protecting whistleblowers OR encouraging them to come forward about wrongdoing  The UK Government are endeavouring to encourage a cultural change on the workplace so that employees can feel confident enough to air concerns without fear of reprisal  Recognizing that the Public Interest Disclosure Act  PIDA  1998 is more concerned with detriment after the whistleblowing event  the Whistleblowing Commission is particularly concerned with additional whistleblower protections that may be instituted from the very outset  or even from BEFORE the initial disclosure of wrongdoing  through a Whistleblower Registration Scheme overseen by an independent body  Recommendations and Guidelines across all industrial and governmental sectors are due publication in Spring 2014   3 9  United States  Under most federal whistleblower statutes  in order to be considered a whistleblower in the United States  the federal employee must have reason to believe his or her employer has violated some law  rule or regulation  testify or commence a legal proceeding on the legally protected matter  or refuse to violate the law   In cases where whistleblowing on a specified topic is protected by statute  U S  courts have generally held that such whistleblowers are protected from retaliation  However  a closely divided U S  Supreme Court decision  Garcetti v  Ceballos  2006  held that the First Amendment free speech guarantees for government employees do not protect disclosures made within the scope of the employees  duties   Whistleblowing in the U S  is affected by a complex patchwork of contradictory laws   In the United States  legal protections vary according to the subject matter of the whistleblowing  and sometimes the state in which the case arises  In passing the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act  the Senate Judiciary Committee found that whistleblower protections were dependent on the  patchwork and vagaries  of varying state statutes  Still  a wide variety of federal and state laws protect employees who call attention to violations  help with enforcement proceedings  or refuse to obey unlawful directions   The first US law adopted specifically to protect whistleblowers was the 1863 United States False Claims Act  revised in 1986   which tried to combat fraud by suppliers of the United States government during the Civil War  The act encourages whistleblowers by promising them a percentage of the money recovered or damages won by the government and protects them from wrongful dismissal   Another US law that specifically protects whistleblowers is the Lloyd–La Follette Act of 1912  It guaranteed the right of federal employees to furnish information to the United States Congress  The first US environmental law to include an employee protection was the Clean Water Act of 1972  Similar protections were included in subsequent federal environmental laws  including the Safe Drinking Water Act  1974   Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  1976   Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976  Energy Reorganization Act of 1974  through 1978 amendment to protect nuclear whistleblowers   Comprehensive Environmental Response  Compensation  and Liability Act  CERCLA  or the Superfund Law   1980   and the Clean Air Act  1990   Similar employee protections enforced through OSHA are included in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act  1982  to protect truck drivers  the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act  PSIA  of 2002  the Wendell H  Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century   AIR 21    and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act  enacted on July 30  2002  for corporate fraud whistleblowers    Investigation of retaliation against whistleblowers under 20 federal statutes falls under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program of the United States Department of Labor s Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA   New whistleblower statutes enacted by Congress which are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor are generally delegated by a Secretary s Order to OSHA s Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program  OWPP    The patchwork of laws means that victims of retaliation need to be alert to the laws at issue to determine the deadlines and means for making proper complaints  Some deadlines are as short as 10 days  for Arizona State Employees to file a  Prohibited Personnel Practice  Complaint before the Arizona State Personnel Board  and Ohio public employees to file appeals with the State Personnel Board of Review   It is 30 days for environmental whistleblowers to make a written complaint to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA   Federal employees complaining of discrimination  retaliation or other violations of the civil rights laws have 45 days to make a written complaint to their agency s equal employment opportunity  EEO  officer  Airline workers and corporate fraud whistleblowers have 90 days to make their complaint to OSHA  Nuclear whistleblowers and truck drivers have 180 days to make complaints to OSHA  Victims of retaliation against union organizing and other concerted activities to improve working conditions have six months to make complaints to the National Labor Relations Board  NLRB   Private sector employees have either 180 or 300 days to make complaints to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  depending on whether their state has a  deferral  agency  for discrimination claims on the basis of race  gender  age  national origin or religion  Those who face retaliation for seeking minimum wages or overtime have either two or three years to file a civil lawsuit  depending on whether the court finds the violation was  willful    Those who report a false claim against the federal government  and suffer adverse employment actions as a result  may have up to six years  depending on state law  to file a civil suit for remedies under the US False Claims Act  FCA   Under a qui tam provision  the  original source  for the report may be entitled to a percentage of what the government recovers from the offenders  However  the  original source  must also be the first to file a federal civil complaint for recovery of the federal funds fraudulently obtained  and must avoid publicizing the claim of fraud until the US Justice Department decides whether to prosecute the claim itself  Such qui tam lawsuits must be filed under seal  using special procedures to keep the claim from becoming public until the federal government makes its decision on direct prosecution   Federal employees could benefit from the Whistleblower Protection Act  and the No FEAR Act  which made individual agencies directly responsible for the economic sanctions of unlawful retaliation   Federal protections are enhanced in those few cases where the Office of Special Counsel will support the whistleblower s appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board  MSPB   The MSPB rejects the vast majority of whistleblower appeals  however  as does the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals  Efforts to strengthen the law have met with failure in recent years  but minor reforms seem likely  See  e g  Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2011  S  743  H  Rep  3289  112th Cong   2011    3 10  Other countries  There are comprehensive laws in New Zealand and South Africa  A number of other countries have recently adopted comprehensive whistleblower laws including Ghana  South Korea  and Uganda  They are also being considered in Kenya and Rwanda  The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2008 that whistleblowing was protected as freedom of expression   4  See also  5  Notes and references  6  Bibliography  Engineering Ethics concepts and cases by Charles E
