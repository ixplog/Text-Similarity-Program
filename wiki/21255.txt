North Korea     officially the Democratic People s Republic of Korea  DPRK  Chosŏn gŭl    Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk   is a country in East Asia  in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula  The capital and largest city is Pyongyang  North Korea shares a land border with China to the north and north west  along the Amnok  Yalu  and Tumen rivers  A small section of the Tumen River also forms North Korea s short border with Russia to the northeast  The Korean Demilitarized Zone marks the boundary between North Korea and South Korea  The legitimacy of this border is not accepted by either side  as both states claim to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula   Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910  In 1945  when Japan was defeated in World War II  Korea was divided into two zones  with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south by the United States  Negotiations on unification failed  and in 1948 two separate governments were formed  the Democratic People s Republic of Korea in the north  and the Republic of Korea in the south  The conflicting claims of sovereignty led to the Korean War in 1950  An armistice in 1953 committed both to a cease fire  but the two countries remain officially at war because a formal peace treaty was never signed  Both states were accepted into the United Nations in 1991   The DPRK holds elections and describes itself as a self reliant socialist state  but it is widely considered a dictatorship and has been described as totalitarian and Stalinist  with an elaborate cult of personality around Kim Il sung and his family  Human rights violations in North Korea are in a category of their own  with no parallel in the contemporary world as assessed by international human rights organizations  The Workers  Party of Korea  led by a member of the ruling family  holds power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be a member   Over time North Korea has gradually distanced itself from the world Communist movement  Juche  an ideology of national self reliance  was introduced into the constitution as a  creative application of Marxism–Leninism  in 1972  In 2009  the constitution was amended again  quietly removing the brief references to communism  Chosŏn gŭl      The means of production are owned by the state through state run enterprises and collectivized farms  and most services such as healthcare  education  housing and food production are state funded or subsidized  In the 1990s North Korea suffered from a famine and continues to struggle with food production   North Korea follows Songun  or  military first  policy  It is the world s most militarized society  with a total of 9 495 000 active  reserve  and paramilitary personnel  Its active duty army of 1 21 million is the 4th largest in the world  after China  the U S   and India  It also possesses nuclear weapons   1  Etymology  The name Korea is derived from Goryeo  or Koryo   a name used by ancient and medieval kingdoms   2  History  2 1  Early history  Korea has a long history going back to ancient times  It has been governed by many different kingdoms  with different borders  including multiple kingdoms existing at the same time  For centuries it struggled under Chinese domination  At the end of the nineteenth century  it decisively asserted its independence  creating the Korean Empire  Its resistance to foreign influence led to it being dubbed the  hermit kingdom    2 2  Japanese occupation  1910–1945   In 1910  in the aftermath of the Russo Japanese War  Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan   Japan tried to suppress Korean traditions and culture and ran the economy primarily for its own benefit  Anti Japanese  pro liberation rallies took place nationwide on 1 March 1919  the 1 March Movement   About 7 000 people were killed during the suppression of this movement  Continued anti Japanese uprisings  such as the nationwide uprising of students in 1929  led to the strengthening of military rule in 1931  After the outbreaks of the Sino Japanese War in 1937 and World War II  Japan stepped up efforts to extinguish Korean culture   Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names  Worship at Japanese Shinto shrines was made compulsory  The school curriculum was radically modified to eliminate teaching in the Korean language and history  Numerous Korean cultural artifacts were destroyed or taken to Japan  Resistance groups known as Dongnipgun  Liberation Army  operated along the Sino Korean border  fighting guerrilla warfare against Japanese forces  Some of them took part in allied action in China and parts of South East Asia  One of the guerrilla leaders was the Communist Kim Il sung  who later became the leader of North Korea   During World War II  Koreans at home were forced to support the Japanese war effort  Tens of thousands of men were conscripted into Japan s military  Around 200 000 girls and women  many from Korea  were forced to engage in sexual services for the Japanese military  with the euphemism  comfort women    2 3  Division of Korea  1945   At the end of World War II in 1945  the Korean peninsula was divided into two zones along the 38th parallel  with the northern half of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet Union and the southern half by the United States   The Provisional People s Committee for North Korea was set up in February 1946 in the Soviet zone  headed by Kim Il sung  He introduced sweeping land reforms and nationalized key industries  Talks on the future of Korea were held in Moscow and Seoul but without result  Initial hopes for a unified  independent Korea evaporated as the politics of the Cold War resulted in the establishment of two separate nations with diametrically opposed political  economic  and social systems   There was sporadic unrest in the South  In September 1946  South Korean citizens had risen up against the Allied Military Government  In April 1948  an uprising of the Jeju islanders was violently crushed  The South declared its statehood in May 1948 and two months later the ardent anti Communist Syngman Rhee became its ruler  The Democratic People s Republic of Korea was established in the North on 9 September 1948   The Rhee regime consolidated itself through harsh persecution of all suspected opponents  It conducted a number of military campaigns against left wing insurgents during which 30 000 to 100 000 people lost their lives  In October 1948  the Yeosu Suncheon Rebellion occurred and on 24 December 1949  the South Korean Army massacred Mungyeong citizens who were suspected communist sympathizers and affixed the blame on communists   Soviet forces withdrew from the North in 1948 and most American forces withdrew from the South the following year   2 4  Korean War  1950–1953   The military of North Korea invaded the South on 25 June 1950  and swiftly overran most of the country  A United Nations force  led by the United States  intervened to defend the South  and rapidly advanced into North Korea  As they neared the border with China  Chinese forces intervened on behalf of North Korea  shifting the balance of the war again  Fighting ended on 27 July 1953  with an armistice that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea  More than one million civilians and soldiers were killed in the war  As a result of the war  almost every substantial building in North Korea was destroyed   Although some have referred to the conflict as a civil war  other important factors were involved  The Korean War was also the first armed confrontation of the Cold War and set the standard for many later conflicts  It is often viewed as an example of the proxy war  where the two superpowers would fight in another country  forcing the people in that country to suffer most of the destruction and death involved in a war between such large nations  The superpowers avoided descending into an all out war against one another  as well as the mutual use of nuclear weapons  It also expanded the Cold War  which to that point had mostly been concerned with Europe   A heavily guarded demilitarized zone still divides the peninsula  and an anti Communist and anti North Korea sentiment remains in South Korea  Since the war  the United States has maintained a strong military presence in the South which is depicted by the North Korean government as an imperialist occupation force   2 5  Post war 20th century  The relative peace between the South and the North following the armistice was interrupted by border skirmishes  celebrity abductions  and assassination attempts  The North failed in several assassination attempts on South Korean leaders  most notably in 1968  1974 and the Rangoon bombing in 1983  tunnels were frequently found under the DMZ and war nearly broke out over the axe murder incident at Panmunjom in 1976  In 1973  extremely secret  high level contacts began to be conducted through the offices of the Red Cross  but ended after the Panmunjom incident  with little progress having been made and the idea that the two Koreas would join international organizations separately   North Korea remained closely aligned to China and the Soviet Union until the mid 1960s  Recovery from the war was quick — by 1957 industrial production reached 1949 levels  The last Chinese troops withdrew from the country in October 1958  In 1959  relations with Japan had improved somewhat  and North Korea began allowing the repatriation of Japanese citizens in the country  The same year  North Korea revalued the North Korean won  which held greater value than its South Korean counterpart  Until the 1960s  economic growth was higher than in South Korea  and North Korean GDP per capita was equal to that of its southern neighbor as late as 1976   In the early 1970s China began normalizing its relations with the West  particularly the U S   and reevaluating its relations with North Korea  The diplomatic problems culminated in 1976 with the death of Mao Zedong  In response  Kim Il Sung began severing ties with China and reemphasizing national and economic self reliance enshrined in his Juche Idea  which promoted producing everything within the country  By the 1980s the economy had begun to stagnate  started its long decline in 1987  and almost completely collapsed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 when all Russian aid was suddenly halted  The North began reestablishing trade relations with China shortly thereafter  but the Chinese could not afford to provide enough food aid to meet demand  Flooding in the mid 1990s exacerbated the economic crisis  severely damaging crops and infrastructure and led to widespread famine which the government proved incapable of curtailing  In 1996  the government accepted UN food aid   In 1992  as Kim Il sung s health began deteriorating  Kim Jong il slowly began taking over various state tasks and after his father died of a heart attack in 1994  declared a three year period of national mourning before officially announcing his position as the new leader  Kim Jong il instituted a policy called Songun  or  military first   There is much speculation about this policy being used as a strategy to strengthen the military while discouraging coup attempts  Restrictions on travel were tightened and the state security apparatus was strengthened   In the late 1990s  North Korea began making attempts at normalizing relations with the West and negotiating disarmament deals with U S  officials in exchange for economic aid  At the same time  building on Nordpolitik  South Korea began to engage with the North as part of its Sunshine Policy   2 6  21st century  The international environment changed with the election of U S  President George W Bush in 2001  His administration rejected South Korea s Sunshine Policy and former President Bill Clinton s negotiations with North Korea  The U S  government treated North Korea as a rogue state  while North Korea redoubled its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons to avoid the fate of Iraq   On October 9  2006  North Korea announced it had conducted its first nuclear weapons test  In August 2009  former U S  president Bill Clinton met with Kim Jong il to secure the release of two American journalists who had been sentenced for entering the country illegally  Current U S  President Barack Obama s position towards North Korea has been to resist making deals with North Korea for the sake of defusing tension  a policy known as  strategic patience    Tensions with South Korea and the United States increased in 2010 with the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan and North Korea s shelling of Yeonpyeong Island   On 17 December 2011  the Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong il died from a heart attack  His youngest son Kim Jong un was announced as his successor   In 2013 an international crisis erupted regarding North Korea s attempts to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles  It escalated as North Korea threatened to launch a nuclear strike against the United States and announced it had pulled out of the armistice agreement   3  Geography  North Korea occupies the northern portion of the Korean Peninsula  lying between latitudes 37° and 43°N  and longitudes 124° and 131°E  It covers an area of   North Korea shares land borders with China and Russia to the north  and borders South Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone  To its west are the Yellow Sea and Korea Bay  and to its east lies Japan across the Sea of Japan  East Sea of Korea    The capital and largest city is Pyongyang  other major cities include Kaesong in the south  Sinuiju in the northwest  Wonsan and Hamhung in the east and Chongjin in the northeast   Early European visitors to Korea remarked that the country resembled  a sea in a heavy gale  because of the many successive mountain ranges that crisscross the peninsula  Some 80% of North Korea is composed of mountains and uplands  separated by deep and narrow valleys  All of the Korean peninsula s mountains with elevations of or more are located in North Korea  The coastal plains are wide in the west and discontinuous in the east  A great majority of the population lives in the plains and lowlands  According to a United Nations Environmental Programme report in 2003  forest covers over 70 percent of the country  mostly on steep slopes  The longest river is the Amnok  Yalu  River which flows for    The highest point in North Korea is Baekdu Mountain  a volcanic mountain which forms part of the Chinese North Korean border with basalt lava plateau with elevations between above sea level  The Hamgyong Range  located in the extreme northeastern part of the peninsula  has many high peaks including Kwanmobong at approximately    Other major ranges include the Rangrim Mountains  which are located in the north central part of North Korea and run in a north south direction  making communication between the eastern and western parts of the country rather difficult  and the Kangnam Range  which runs along the North Korea–China border  Mount Kumgang  or Diamond Mountain   approximately   in the Taebaek Range  which extends into South Korea  is famous for its scenic beauty   3 1  Climate  North Korea has a combination of a continental climate and an oceanic climate  with four distinct seasons  Most of North Korea is classified as being of a humid continental climate within the Köppen climate classification scheme  with warm summers and cold  dry winters  In summer  there is a short rainy season called changma   Long winters bring bitter cold and clear weather interspersed with snow storms as a result of northern and northwestern winds that blow from Siberia  The daily average high and low temperatures for Pyongyang in January are   On average  it snows thirty seven days during the winter  Winter can be particularly harsh in the northern  mountainous regions   Summer tends to be short  hot  humid  and rainy because of the southern and southeastern monsoon winds that bring moist air from the Pacific Ocean  Spring and autumn are transitional seasons marked by mild temperatures and variable winds and bring the most pleasant weather  The daily average high and low temperatures for Pyongyang in August are    On average  approximately 60% of all precipitation occurs from June to September  Natural hazards include late spring droughts which are often followed by severe flooding  Typhoons affect the peninsula on an average of at least once every summer or early autumn   3 2  Environment  The environment of North Korea has been reported to be in a state of  crisis    catastrophe   or  collapse    In 2013 a delegation of visiting scientists reported major environmental devastation  They described an absence of wildlife and said that the  landscape is basically dead   This situation was described as  so severe it could destabilize the whole country    Cultivation  logging  and natural disasters have all put pressure on North Korea s forests  During the economic crisis of the 1990s  deforestation accelerated  as people turned to the woodlands to provide firewood and food  This in turn has led to soil erosion  soil depletion  and increased risk of flooding  In response  the government has promoted a tree planting program   Based on satellite imagery  it has been estimated that 40 percent of forest cover has been lost since 1985   4  Administrative divisions  5  Government and politics  North Korea functions as a highly centralized  single party republic  According to its 2009 constitution  it is a revolutionary Socialist state  guided in its activities by the Juche idea and the Songun idea   The Korean Workers  Party has an estimated 3 000 000 members and dominates every aspect of North Korean politics  It has two satellite organizations  the Korean Social Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party which participate in the KWP led Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland  Another highly influential structure is the independent National Defence Commission  NDC   Kim Jong un of the Kim family heads all major governing structures  he is First Secretary of the KWP  First Chairman of the NDC  and Supreme Commander of the Korean People s Army  Kim Il sung  who died in 1994  is the country s  Eternal President   while Kim Jong il was announced  Eternal General Secretary  after his death in 2011   The unicameral Supreme People s Assembly  SPA  is the highest organ of state authority and holds the legislative power  Its 687 members are elected every five years by universal suffrage  Supreme People s Assembly sessions are convened by the SPA Presidium  whose president  Kim Yong nam since 1998  also represents the state in relations with foreign countries  Deputies formally elect the President  the vice presidents and members of the Presidium and take part in the constitutionally appointed activities of the legislature  pass laws  establish domestic and foreign policies  appoint members of the cabinet  review and approve the state economic plan  among others  However  the SPA itself cannot initiate any legislation independently of Party or state organs  It is unknown whether it has ever criticized or amended bills placed before it  and the elections are based around a single list of KWP approved candidates who stand without opposition   Executive power is vested in the Cabinet of North Korea  which is headed by Premier Pak Pong ju  The Premier represents the government and functions independently  His authority extends over two vice premiers  30 ministers  two cabinet commission chairmen  the cabinet chief secretary  the president of the Central Bank  the director of the Central Statistics Bureau and the president of the Academy of Sciences  A 31st ministry  the Ministry of the People s Armed Forces  is under the jurisdiction of the National Defence Commission   5 1  Political ideology  The Juche ideology is the cornerstone of party works and government operations  It is viewed by the official North Korean line as an embodiment of Kim Il sung s wisdom  an expression of his leadership  and an idea which provides  a complete answer to any question that arises in the struggle for national liberation   Juche was pronounced in December 1955 in order to emphasize a Korea centered revolution  Its core tenets are economic self sufficiency  military self reliance and an independent foreign policy  The roots of Juche were made up of a complex mixture of factors  including the cult of personality centred on Kim Il sung  the conflict with pro Soviet and pro Chinese dissenters  and Korea s centuries long struggle for independence   It was initially promoted as a  creative application  of Marxism–Leninism  but in the mid 1970s  it was described by state propaganda as  the only scientific thought   and most effective revolutionary theoretical structure that leads to the future of communist society   Juche eventually replaced Marxist–Leninism entirely by the 1980s  and in 1992 references to the latter were omitted from the constitution  The 2009 constitution dropped references to communism  but retained references to socialism  Juche s concepts of self reliance have thus evolved with time and circumstances  but still provide the groundwork for the spartan austerity  sacrifice and discipline demanded by the Party   Some foreign observers have instead described North Korea s political system as an absolute monarchy or a  hereditary dictatorship   Others view its ideology as a racialist focused nationalism similar to that of Shōwa Japan  or bearing a resemblance to European Fascism  A defected North Korean scholar dismisses the idea that Juche is the country s leading ideology  regarding its public exaltation as designed to deceive foreigners   5 2  Personality cult  The North Korean government exercises control over many aspects of the nation s culture  and this control is used to perpetuate a cult of personality surrounding Kim Il sung  and  to a lesser extent  Kim Jong il  While visiting North Korea in 1979  journalist Bradley Martin noted that nearly all music  art  and sculpture that he observed glorified  Great Leader  Kim Il sung  whose personality cult was then being extended to his son   Dear Leader  Kim Jong il  Bradley Martin also reported that there is even widespread belief that Kim Il sung  created the world   and Kim Jong il could  control the weather    Such reports are contested by North Korea researcher Brian R  Myers   divine powers have never been attributed to either of the two Kims  In fact  the propaganda apparatus in Pyongyang has generally been careful not to make claims that run directly counter to citizens’ experience or common sense   He further explains that the state propaganda painted Kim Jong il as someone whose expertise lay in military matters and that the famine of the 1990s was partially caused by natural disasters out of Kim Jong il s control   The song  No Motherland Without You   당신이없으면 조국도없다   sung by the North Korean Army Choir  was created especially for Kim Jong il and is one of the most popular tunes in the country  Kim Il sung is still officially revered as the nation s  Eternal President   Several landmarks in North Korea are named for Kim Il sung  including Kim Il sung University  Kim Il sung Stadium  and Kim Il sung Square  Defectors have been quoted as saying that North Korean schools deify both father and son  Kim Il sung rejected the notion that he had created a cult around himself  and accused those who suggested this of  factionalism   Following the death of Kim Il sung  North Koreans were prostrating and weeping to a bronze statue of him in an organized event  similar scenes were broadcast by state television following the death of Kim Jong il   Critics maintain this Kim Jong il personality cult was inherited from his father  Kim Il sung  Kim Jong il was often the center of attention throughout ordinary life in the DPRK  His birthday is one of the most important public holidays in the country  On his 60th birthday  based on his official date of birth   mass celebrations occurred throughout the country  Kim Jong il s personality cult  although significant  was not as extensive as his father s  One point of view is that Kim Jong il s cult of personality was solely out of respect for Kim Il sung or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage  Media and government sources from outside of North Korea generally support this view  while North Korean government sources say that it is genuine hero worship   B  R  Myers also argues that the worship is real and not unlike worship of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany  In a more recent event – on – a 14 year old North Korean schoolgirl drowned while attempting to rescue portraits of Kim Il sung and Kim Jong il from a flood   5 3  Law enforcement and internal security  North Korea has a civil law system based on the Prussian model and influenced by Japanese traditions and Communist legal theory  Judiciary procedures are handled by the Central Court  the highest court of appeal   provincial or special city level courts  people s courts and special courts  People s courts are at the lowest level of the system and operate in cities  counties and urban districts  while different kinds of special courts handle cases related to military  railroad or maritime matters   Judges are theoretically elected by their respective local people s assemblies  but in practice they re appointed by the Korean Workers  Party  The penal code is based on the principle of nullum crimen sine lege  no crime without a law   but remains a tool for political control despite several amendments reducing ideological influence  Courts carry out legal procedures related to not only criminal and civil matters  but also political cases as well  Political prisoners are sent to labor camps  while criminal offenders are incarcerated in a separate system   The Ministry of People s Security  MPS  maintains most law enforcement activities  It is one of the most powerful state institutions in North Korea and oversees the national police force  investigates criminal cases and manages non political correctional facilities  It also handles other aspects of domestic security like civil registration  traffic control  fire departments and railroad security  The State Security Department was separated from the MPS in 1973 to conduct domestic and foreign intelligence  counterintelligence and manage the political prison system  Political camps can be short term reeducation zones or  total control zones  for lifetime detention  Camp 14 in Kaechon  Camp 15 in Yodok and Camp 18 in Bukchang are described in detailed testimonies   The security apparatus is very extensive  exerting strict control over residence  travel  employment  clothing  food and family life  Security establishments tightly monitor cellular and digital communications  The MPS  State Security and the Police allegedly conduct real time monitoring of text messages  online data transfer  monitor phone calls and automatically transcribe recorded conversations  They reportedly have the capacity to triangulate a subscriber s exact location  while military intelligence monitors phone and radio traffic as far as 140 kilometers south of the Demilitarized zone  Mass surveillance is carried out through a system which includes 100 000 CCTV cameras  many of which are installed at the border with China   5 4  Foreign relations  Initially  North Korea had diplomatic ties with only other Communist countries  In the 1960s and 1970s  it pursued an independent foreign policy  established relations with many developing countries  and joined the Non Aligned Movement  In the late 1980s and the 1990s its foreign policy was thrown into turmoil with the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Suffering an economic crisis  it closed 30% of its embassies  At the same time  North Korea sought to build relations with developed free market countries  As a result of its isolation  it is sometimes known as the  hermit kingdom    As of 2012  North Korea had diplomatic relations with 162 countries  as well as the European Union and the Palestinian Authority  and embassies in 42 countries  North Korea continues to have strong ties with its socialist southeast Asian allies in Vietnam and Laos  as well as with Cambodia  Most of the foreign embassies to North Korea are located in Beijing rather than in Pyongyang  The Korean Demilitarized Zone with South Korea is the most heavily fortified border in the world   As a result of the North Korean nuclear weapons program  the six party talks were established to find a peaceful solution to the growing tension between the two Korean governments  the Russian Federation  the People s Republic of China  Japan  and the United States  North Korea was previously designated a state sponsor of terrorism because of its alleged involvement in the 1983 Rangoon bombing and the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner  On 11 October 2008  the United States removed North Korea from its list of states that sponsor terrorism after Pyongyang agreed to cooperate on issues related to its nuclear program  The kidnapping of at least 13 Japanese citizens by North Korean agents in the 1970s and the 1980s was another major issue in the country s foreign policy   5 4 1  Korean reunification  North Korea s policy is to seek reunification without what it sees as outside interference  through a federal structure retaining each side s leadership and systems  In 2000  both North and South Korea signed the June 15th North–South Joint Declaration in which both sides made promises to seek out a peaceful reunification  The Democratic Federal Republic of Korea is a proposed state first mentioned by then North Korean president Kim Il sung on 10 October 1980  proposing a federation between North and South Korea in which the respective political systems would initially remain   Inter Korean relations are at the core of North Korean diplomacy and have seen numerous shifts in the last few decades  In 1972  the two Koreas agreed in principle to achieve reunification through peaceful means and without foreign interference  Despite this  relations remained cool well until the early 1990s  with the exception of a brief period in the early 1980s when North Korea provided flood relief to its southern neighbor and the two countries organized a reunion of 92 separated families   The Sunshine Policy instituted by South Korean president Kim Dae jung in 1998 was a watershed in inter Korean relations  It encouraged other countries to engage with the North  which allowed Pyongyang to normalize relations with a number of European Union states and contributed to the establishment of joint North South economic projects  The culmination of the Sunshine Policy was the 2000 Inter Korean Summit  when Kim Dae jung visited Kim Jong il in Pyongyang  On 4 October 2007  South Korean President Roh Moo hyun and Kim Jong il signed an 8 point peace agreement   Relations worsened yet again in the late 2000s and early 2010s when South Korean president Lee Myung bak adopted a more hard line approach and suspended aid deliveries pending the de nuclearization of the North  North Korea responded by ending all of its previous agreements with the South  It also deployed additional ballistic missiles and placed its military on full combat alert after South Korea  Japan and the United States threatened to intercept a Unha 2 space launch vehicle  The next few years witnessed a string of hostilities  including the alleged North Korean involvement in the sinking of South Korean warship Cheonan  mutual ending of diplomatic ties  a North Korean artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island  and an international crisis involving threats of a nuclear exchange   5 5  Military  The Korean People s Army  KPA  is the name of North Korea s military organization  The KPA has 1 106 000 active and 8 389 000 reserve and paramilitary troops  making it the largest military institution in the world  About 20% of men aged 17–54 serve in the regular armed forces  and approximately one in every 25 citizens is an enlisted soldier  The KPA has five branches  Ground Force  Naval Force  Air Force  Special Operations Force  and Rocket Force  Command of the Korean People s Army lies in both the Central Military Commission of the Korean Workers  Party and the independent National Defense Commission  The Ministry of the People s Armed Forces is subordinated to the latter   Of all KPA branches  the Ground Force is the largest  It has approximately 1 million personnel divided into 80 infantry divisions  30 artillery brigades  25 special warfare brigades  20 mechanized brigades  10 tank brigades and seven tank regiments  They are equipped with 3 700 tanks  2 100 APCs and IFVs  17 900 artillery pieces  11 000 anti aircraft guns and some 10 000 MANPADS and anti tank guided missiles  Other equipment includes 1 600 aircraft in the Air Force and 1 000 vessels in the Navy  North Korea has the largest special forces and the largest submarine fleet in the world   North Korea possesses nuclear weapons  but its arsenal remains limited  Various estimates put its stockpile at less than 10 plutonium warheads and 12–27 nuclear weapon equivalents if uranium warheads are considered  Delivery capabilities are provided by the Rocket Force  which has some 1 000 ballistic missiles with a range of up to 3 000 kilometres   According to a 2004 South Korean assessment  North Korea possesses a stockpile of chemical weapons estimated to amount to 2 500–5 000 tons  including nerve  blister  blood  and vomiting agents  as well as the ability to cultivate and produce biological weapons including anthrax  smallpox  and cholera  Because of its nuclear and missile tests  North Korea has been sanctioned under United Nations Security Council resolutions 1695 of July 2006  1718 of October 2006  1874 of June 2009  and 2087 of January 2013   The military faces some issues limiting its conventional capabilities  including obsolete equipment  insufficient fuel supplies and a shortage of digital command and control assets  To compensate for these deficiencies  the KPA has deployed a wide range of asymmetric warfare technologies like anti personnel blinding lasers  GPS jammers  midget submarines and human torpedoes  stealth paint  electromagnetic pulse bombs  and cyberwarfare units  KPA units have also attempted to jam South Korean military satellites   Much of the equipment is engineered and produced by a domestic defense industry  Weapons are manufactured in roughly 1 800 underground defense industry plants scattered throughout the country  most of them located in Chagang Province  The defense industry is capable of producing a full range of individual and crew served weapons  artillery  armoured vehicles  tanks  missiles  helicopters  surface combatants  submarines  landing and infiltration craft  Yak 18 trainers and possibly co production of jet aircraft  According to official North Korean media  military expenditures for 2010 amount to 15 8% of the state budget   6  Society  6 1  Demographics  With the exception of a small Chinese community and a few ethnic Japanese  North Korea s 24 852 000 people are ethnically homogeneous  Demographic experts in the 20th century estimated that the population would grow to 25 5 million by 2000 and 28 million by 2010  but this increase never occurred due to the North Korean famine  It began in 1995  lasted for three years and resulted in the deaths of between 300 000 and 800 000 North Koreans annually  The deaths were most likely caused by malnutrition related illnesses like pneumonia and tuberculosis rather than starvation   International donors led by the United States initiated shipments of food through the World Food Program in 1997 to combat the famine  Despite a drastic reduction of aid under the Bush Administration  the situation gradually improved  the number of malnourished children declined from 60% in 1998 to 37% in 2006 and 28% in 2013  Domestic food production almost recovered to the recommended annual level of 5 37 million tons of cereal equivalent in 2013  but the World Food Program reported a continuing lack of dietary diversity and access to fats and proteins   The famine had a significant impact on the population growth rate  which declined to 0 9% annually in 2002 and 0 53% in 2014  Late marriages after military service  limited housing space and long hours of work or political studies further exhaust the population and reduce growth  The national birth rate is 14 5 births per 1 000 population  Two thirds of households consist of extended families mostly living in two room units  Marriage is virtually universal and divorce is extremely rare   6 2  Health  North Korea had an life expectancy of 69 8 years in 2013  While North Korea is classified as a low income country  the structure of North Korea s causes of death  2013  are unlike that of other low income countries  Instead  it is closer to worldwide averages  with non communicable diseases—such as cardiovascular disease and cancers—accounting for two thirds of the total deaths   A 2013 study reported that communicable diseases and malnutrition are responsible for 29% of the total deaths in North Korea  This figure is higher than those of high income countries and South Korea  but half of the average 57% of all deaths in other low income countries  Infectious diseases like tuberculosis  malaria  and hepatitis B are considered to be endemic to the country as a result of the famine   Cardiovascular disease as a single disease group is the largest cause of death in North Korea  2013   The three major causes of death in DPR Korea are ischaemic heart disease  13%   lower respiratory infections  11%  and cerebrovascular disease  7%   Non communicable diseases risk factors in North Korea include high rates of urbanisation  an aging society  high rates of smoking and alcohol consumption amongst men   Almost 100% of the population has access to water and sanitation  60% of the population had access to improved sanitation facilities in 2000   A free universal insurance system is in place  but quality of medical care varies significantly by region  Preventive medicine is emphasized through physical exercise and sports  nationwide monthly checkups and routine spraying of public places against disease  Every individual has a lifetime health card which contains a full medical record   6 3  Education  The 2008 census listed the entire population as literate  including those in the age group beyond 80  An 11 year free  compulsory cycle of primary and secondary education is provided in more than 27 000 nursery schools  14 000 kindergartens  4 800 four year primary and 4 700 six year secondary schools  Some 77% of males and 79% of females aged 30–34 have finished secondary school  An additional 300 universities and colleges offer higher education  Kim Il sung University is the only one with four year courses   Most graduates from the compulsory program do not attend university but begin their obligatory military service or proceed to work in farms or factories instead  The main deficiencies of higher education are the heavy presence of ideological subjects  which comprise 50% of courses in social studies and 20% in sciences  and the imbalances in curriculum  The study of natural sciences is greatly emphasized while social sciences are neglected  Heuristics is actively applied to develop the independence and creativity of students throughout the system  Studying of Russian and English language was made compulsory in upper middle schools in 1978   6 4  Language  North Korea shares the Korean language with South Korea  although some dialect differences exist within both Koreas  North Koreans refer to their Pyongyang dialect as munhwa   cultured language   as opposed to South Korea s Seoul dialect  the p yojuno   standard language    which is viewed as decadent because of its usage of Japanese and English loanwords   Words from Japanese  Chinese or Western origin have been eliminated from munhwa along with the usage of Chinese hanja characters  Written language uses the chosŏn gul phonetic alphabet  developed under Sejong the Great  1418 – 1450    6 5  Religion  Freedom of religion and the right to religious ceremonies are constitutionally guaranteed  but religions are restricted in practice  According to Religious Intelligence  64 3% of the population are irreligious adherents of the Juche idea  16% practice Korean shamanism  13 5% practice Chondoism  4 5% are Buddhist and 1 7% are Christian   The influence of Buddhism and Confucianism still has an effect on cultural life  Buddhists reportedly fare better than other religious groups  They are given limited funding by the government to promote the religion  because Buddhism played an integral role in traditional Korean culture   Chondoism   Heavenly Way   is an indigenous syncretic belief combining elements of Korean shamanism  Buddhism  Taoism and Catholicism that is officially represented by the KWP controlled Chongu Party  In contrast  the Open Doors mission claims the most severe persecution of Christians in the world occurs in North Korea  Four state sanctioned churches exist  but freedom of religion advocates claim these are showcases for foreigners  Amnesty International has also expressed concerns about religious persecution in North Korea   6 6  Formal ranking of citizen s loyalty  According to North Korean documents and refugee testimonies  all North Koreans are sorted into groups according to their Songbun  an ascribed status system based on a citizen s assessed loyalty to the regime  Based on their own behavior and the political  social  and economic background of their family for three generations as well as behavior by relatives within that range  Songbun is allegedly used to determine whether an individual is trusted with responsibility  given opportunities  or even receives adequate food   Songbun allegedly affects access to educational and employment opportunities and particularly whether a person is eligible to join North Korea s ruling party  There are 3 main classifications and about 50 sub classifications  According to Kim Il sung  speaking in 1958  the loyal  core class  constituted 25% of the North Korean population  the  wavering class  55%  and the  hostile class  20%  The highest status is accorded to individuals descended from those who participated with Kim Il sung in the resistance against Japanese occupation during and before World War II and to those who were factory workers  laborers or peasants in 1950   While some analysts believe private commerce recently changed the Songbun system to some extent  most North Korean refugees say it remains a commanding presence in everyday life  However the North Korean government claims all citizens are equal and denies any discrimination on the basis of family background   6 7  Human rights  North Korea is widely accused of having one of the worst human rights records in the world  North Koreans have been referred to as  some of the world s most brutalized people  by Human Rights Watch  because of the severe restrictions placed on their political and economic freedoms  The North Korean population is strictly managed by the state and all aspects of daily life are subordinated to party and state planning  Employment is managed by the party on the basis of political reliability  and travel is tightly controlled by the Ministry of People s Security   Amnesty International also reports of severe restrictions on the freedom of association  expression and movement  arbitrary detention  torture and other ill treatment resulting in death  and executions  North Korea also applies capital punishment  including public executions  Human rights organizations estimate that 1 193 executions had been carried out in the country by 2009   The State Security Department extrajudicially apprehends and imprisons those accused of political crimes without due process  People perceived as hostile to the government  such as Christians or critics of the leadership  are deported to labor camps without trial  often with their whole family and mostly without any chance of being released   Based on satellite images and defector testimonies  Amnesty International estimates that around 200 000 prisoners are held in six large political prison camps  where they are forced to work in conditions approaching slavery  Supporters of the government who deviate from the government line are subject to reeducation in sections of labor camps set aside for that purpose  Those who are deemed politically rehabilitated may reassume responsible government positions on their release   North Korean defectors have provided detailed testimonies on the existence of the total control zones where abuses such as torture  starvation  rape  murder  medical experimentation  forced labor  and forced abortions have been reported  On the basis of these abuses  as well as persecution on political  religious  racial and gender grounds  forcible transfer of populations  enforced disappearance of persons and forced starvation  the United Nations Commission of Inquiry has accused North Korea of crimes against humanity  The International Coalition to Stop Crimes Against Humanity in North Korea  ICNK  estimates that over 10 000 people die in North Korean prison camps every year   The North Korean government rejects the human rights abuses claims  calling them  a smear campaign  and a  human rights racket  aimed at regime change  In a report to the UN  North Korea dismissed accusations of atrocities as  wild rumors   The government also admitted some human rights issues related to living conditions and stated that it is working to improve them   7  Economy  North Korea has been maintaining one of the most closed and centralized economies in the world since the 1940s  For several decades it followed the Soviet pattern of five year plans with the ultimate goal of achieving self sufficiency  Extensive Soviet and Chinese support allowed North Korea to rapidly recover from the Korean War and register very high growth rates  Systematic inefficiency began to arise around 1960  when the economy shifted from the extensive to the intensive development stage  The shortage of skilled labor  energy  arable land and transportation significantly impeded long term growth and resulted in consistent failure to meet planning objectives  The major slowdown of the economy contrasted with South Korea  which surpassed the North in terms of absolute Gross Domestic Product and per capita income by the 1980s  North Korea declared the last seven year plan unsuccessful in December 1993 and thereafter abandoned planning   The loss of Eastern Bloc trading partners and a series of natural disasters throughout the 1990s caused severe hardships  including widespread famine  By 2000  the situation improved owing to a massive international food assistance effort  but the economy continues to suffer from food shortages  dilapidated infrastructure and a critically low energy supply  In an attempt to recover from the collapse  the government began structural reforms in 1998 that formally legalized private ownership of assets and decentralized control over production  A second round of reforms in 2002 led to an expansion of market activities  partial monetization  flexible prices and salaries  and the introduction of incentives and accountability techniques  Despite these changes  North Korea remains a command economy where the state owns almost all means of production and development priorities are defined by the government   North Korea has the structural profile of a relatively industrialized country where nearly half of the Gross Domestic Product is generated by industry and human development is at medium levels  Purchasing power parity  PPP  GDP is estimated at $40 billion  with a very low per capita value of $1 800  In 2012  Gross national income per capita was $1 523  compared to $28 430 in South Korea  The North Korean won is the national currency  issued by the Central Bank of the Democratic People s Republic of Korea   The economy is heavily socialized  Food and housing are extensively subsidized by the state  education and healthcare are free  and the payment of taxes was officially abolished in 1974  A variety of goods are available in department stores and supermarkets in Pyongyang  though most of the population relies on small scale janmadang markets  In 2009  the government attempted to stem the expanding free market by banning janmadang and the use of foreign currency  but the resulting inflation spike and rare public protests caused a reversal of these policies  Private trade is dominated by women because most men are required to be present at their workplace  even though many state owned enterprises are non operational   Industry and services employ 65% of North Korea s 12 6 million labor force  Major industries include machine building  military equipment  chemicals  mining  metallurgy  textiles  food processing and tourism  Iron ore and coal production are among the few sectors where North Korea performs significantly better than its southern neighbor – it produces about 10 times larger amounts of each resource  The agricultural sector was shattered by the natural disasters of the 1990s  Its 3 500 cooperatives and state farms were among the most productive and successful in the world around 1980 but now experience chronic fertilizer and equipment shortages  Rice  corn  soybeans and potatoes are some of the primary crops  A significant contribution to the food supply comes from commercial fishing and aquaculture  Tourism has been a growing sector for the past decade  North Korea aims to increase the number of foreign visitors from 200 000 to one million by 2016 through projects like the Masikryong Ski Resort   Foreign trade surpassed pre crisis levels in 2005 and continues to expand  North Korea has a number of special economic zones  SEZs  and Special Administrative Regions where foreign companies can operate with tax and tariff incentives while North Korean establishments gain access to improved technology  Initially four such zones existed  but they yielded little overall success  The SEZ system was overhauled in 2013 when 14 new zones were opened and the Rason Special Economic Zone was reformed as a joint Chinese North Korean project  The Kaesong Industrial Region is a special economic zone where more than 100 South Korean companies employ some 52 000 North Korean workers  Outside inter Korean trade  more than 89% of external trade is conducted with China  Russia is the second largest foreign partner with $100 million worth of imports and exports for the same year  In 2014  Russia wrote off 90% of North Korea s debt and the two countries agreed to conduct all transactions in rubles  Overall  external trade in 2013 reached a total of $7 3 billion  the highest amount since 1990   while inter Korean trade dropped to an eight year low of $1 1 billion   7 1  Infrastructure  North Korea s energy infrastructure is obsolete and in disrepair  Power shortages are chronic and would not be alleviated even by electricity imports because the poorly maintained grid causes significant losses during transmission  Coal accounts for 70% of primary energy production  followed by hydroelectric power with 17%  The government under Kim Jong un has increased emphasis on renewable energy projects like wind farms  solar parks  solar heating and biomass  A set of legal regulations adopted in 2014 stressed the development of geothermal  wind and solar energy along with recycling and environmental conservation   North Korea also strives to develop its own civilian nuclear program  These efforts are under much international dispute due to their military applications and concerns about safety  Russian energy company Gazprom has a project for a $2 5 billion gas pipeline to South Korea through Pyongyang  which is expected to generate an annual revenue of $100 million from transit fees   Transport infrastructure includes railways  highways  water and air routes  but rail transport is by far the most widespread  North Korea has some 5 200 kilometres of railways mostly in standard gauge which carry 80% of annual passenger traffic and 86% of freight  but electricity shortages undermine their efficiency  Construction of a high speed railway connecting Kaesong  Pyongyang and Sinuiju with speeds exceeding 200 km h was approved in 2013  North Korea connects with the Trans Siberian Railway through Rajin   Road transport is very limited — only 724 kilometers of the 25 554 kilometer road network are paved  and maintenance on most roads is poor  Only 2% of the freight capacity is supported by river and sea transport  and air traffic is negligible  All port facilities are ice free and host a merchant fleet of 158 vessels  Eighty two airports and 23 helipads are operational and the largest serve the state run airline  Air Koryo  Cars are relatively rare  but bicycles are common   7 2  Science and technology  R&D efforts are concentrated at the State Academy of Sciences  which runs 40 research institutes  200 smaller research centers  a scientific equipment factory and six publishing houses  The government considers science and technology to be directly linked to economic development  A five year scientific plan emphasizing IT  biotechnology  nanotechnology  marine and plasma research was carried out in the early 2000s  A 2010 report by the South Korean Science and Technology Policy Institute identified polymer chemistry  animal cloning  single carbon materials  nanoscience  mathematics  software  nuclear technology and rocketry as potential areas of inter Korean scientific cooperation  North Korean institutes are strong in these fields of research  although their engineers require additional training and laboratories need equipment upgrades   Under its  constructing a powerful knowledge economy  slogan  the state has launched a project to concentrate education  scientific research and production into a number of  high tech development zones   However  international sanctions remain a significant obstacle to their development  The Miraewon network of electronic libraries was established in 2014 under similar slogans   Significant resources have been allocated to the national space program  which is managed by the Korean Committee of Space Technology  Domestically produced launch vehicles and the Kwangmyŏngsŏng satellite class are launched from two spaceports  the Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground and the Sohae Satellite Launching Station  After four failed attempts  North Korea became the tenth spacefaring nation with the launch of Kwangmyŏngsŏng 3 Unit 2 in December 2012  which successfully reached orbit but was believed to be crippled and non operational  It joined the Outer Space Treaty in 2009 and has stated its intentions to undertake manned and Moon missions  The government insists the space program is for peaceful purposes  but the United States  Japan  South Korea and other countries maintain that it serves to advance military ballistic missile programs   Usage of communication technology is controlled by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications  An adequate nationwide fiber optic telephone system with 1 18 million fixed lines and expanding mobile coverage is in place  Most phones are installed for senior government officials and installation requires written explanation why the user needs a telephone and how it will be paid for  Cellular coverage is available with a 3G network operated by Koryolink  a joint venture with Orascom Telecom Holding  The number of subscribers has increased from 3 000 in 2002 to almost two million in 2013  International calls through either fixed or cellular service are restricted  and mobile Internet is not available   Internet access itself is limited to a handful of elite users and scientists  Instead  North Korea has a walled garden intranet system called Kwangmyong  which is maintained and monitored by the Korea Computer Center  Its content is limited to state media  chat services  message boards  an e mail service and an estimated 1 000 5 500 websites  Computers employ the Red Star OS  an operating system derived from Linux  with a user shell visually similar to OS X  North Korea s only Internet café is in Pyongyang   8  Culture  Despite a historically strong Chinese influence  Korean culture has shaped its own unique identity  It came under attack during the Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945  when Japan enforced a cultural assimilation policy  Koreans were encouraged to learn and speak Japanese  adopt the Japanese family name system and Shinto religion  and were forbidden to write or speak the Korean language in schools  businesses  or public places   After the peninsula was divided in 1945  two distinct cultures formed out of the common Korean heritage  North Koreans have almost no exposure to foreign influence apart from occasional performances like the New York Philharmonic Orchestra concert in February 2008  Contemporary cultural expression in the country serves a primarily didactic purpose by promoting the Juche idea and Korean reunification  The revolutionary struggle and the brilliance of the leadership are some of the main themes in art   Reactionary  elements from traditional culture have been discarded and cultural forms with a  folk  spirit have been reintroduced   Korean heritage is protected and maintained by the state  Over 190 historical sites and objects of national significance are cataloged as National Treasures of North Korea  while some 1 800 less valuable artifacts are included in a list of Cultural Assets  The Historic Sites and Monuments in Kaesong and the Complex of Goguryeo Tombs are UNESCO World Heritage Sites   8 1  Art  Visual arts are generally produced in the aesthetics of Socialist realism  North Korean painting combines the influence of Soviet and Japanese visual expression to instill a sentimental loyalty to the system  All artists in North Korea are required to join the Artists  Union  and the best among them can receive an official licence to portray the leaders  Portraits and sculptures depicting Kim Il sung  Kim Jong il and Kim Jong un are classed as  Number One works    Most aspects of art have been dominated by Mansudae Art Studio since its establishment in 1959  It employs around 1 000 artists in what is likely the biggest art factory in the world where paintings  murals  posters and monuments are designed and produced  The studio has commercialized its activity and sells its works to collectors in a variety of countries including China  where it is in high demand  Mansudae Overseas Projects is a subdivision of Mansudae Art Studio that carries out construction of large scale monuments for international customers  Some of the projects include the African Renaissance Monument in Senegal  and the Heroes  Acre in Namibia   8 2  Music  The government emphasized optimistic folk based tunes and revolutionary music throughout most of the 20th century  Ideological messages are conveyed through massive orchestral pieces like the  Five Great Revolutionary Operas  based on traditional Korean ch angguk  Revolutionary operas differ from their Western counterparts by adding traditional instruments to the orchestra and avoiding recitative segments  Sea of Blood is the most widely performed of the Five Great Operas  since its premiere in 1971  it has been played over 1 500 times  and its 2010 tour in China was a major success  Western classical music by Brahms  Tchaikovsky  Stravinsky and other composers is performed both by the State Symphony Orchestra and student orchestras   Pop music appeared in the 1980s with the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble and Wangjaesan Light Music Band  Improved relations with South Korea following the Inter Korean Summit caused a decline in direct ideological messages in pop songs  but themes like comradeship  nostalgia and the construction of a powerful country remained  Today  the all girl Moranbong Band is the most popular group in the country  North Koreans have also been exposed to K pop which spreads through illegal markets   8 3  Literature  Unlike the former Soviet Union  no literary underground exists and there are no known dissident writers  All publishing houses are owned by the government or the KWP because they are considered an important tool for propaganda and agitation  The Workers  Party of Korea Publishing House is the most authoritative among them and publishes all works of Kim Il sung  ideological education materials and party policy documents  Foreign literature did not appear until 1984  when North Korean editions of Indian  German  Chinese and Russian fairy tales  Tales from Shakespeare and some works of Bertolt Brecht and Erich Kästner were printed   Kim Il sung s personal works are considered  classical masterpieces  while the ones created under his instruction are labeled  models of Juche literature   These include The Fate of a Self Defense Corps Man  The Song of Korea and Immortal History  a series of historical novels depicting the suffering of Koreans under Japanese occupation  More than four million literary works were published between the 1980s and the early 2000s  but almost all of them belong to a narrow variety of political genres like  army first revolutionary literature    Science fiction is considered a secondary genre because it somewhat departs from the traditional standards of detailed descriptions and metaphors of the leader  The exotic settings of the stories give authors more freedom to depict cyberwarfare  violence  sexual abuse and crime  which are absent in other genres  Sci fi works glorify technology and promote the Juche concept of anthropocentric existence through depictions of robotics  space exploration and immortality   8 4  Media  Government policies towards film are no different than those applied to other arts — motion pictures serve to fulfill the targets of  social education   Some of the most influential films are based on historic events  An Jung geun shoots Itō Hirobumi  or folk tales  Hong Gildong   Most movies have predictable propaganda story lines which make cinema an unpopular entertainment  Viewers only see films that feature their favorite actors  Western productions are only available at private showings to high ranking Party members  although the 1997 Titanic is frequently shown to university students as an example of Western culture  Access to foreign media products is available through smuggled DVDs and television or radio broadcasts in border areas   North Korean media are under some of the strictest government control in the world  Freedom of the press in 2013 was 177th out of 178 countries in a Reporters Without Borders index  According to Freedom House  all media outlets serve as government mouthpieces  all journalists are Party members and listening to foreign broadcasts carries the threat of a death penalty  The main news provider is the Korean Central News Agency  All 12 newspapers and 20 periodicals  including Rodong Sinmun  are published in the capital   There are three state owned TV stations  Two of them broadcast only on weekends and the Korean Central Television is on air every day in the evenings  Uriminzokkiri and its associated YouTube and Twitter accounts distribute imagery  news and video issued by government media  The Associated Press opened the first Western all format  full time bureau in Pyongyang in 2012   Bias in reporting on North Korea has occurred in international media as a result of the country s isolation  Nonsensical stories like Kim Jong un undergoing surgery to look like his grandfather  executing his ex girlfriend or feeding his uncle to a pack of hungry dogs have been circulated by foreign media as truth despite the lack of a credible source  Many of the claims originate from the South Korean right wing newspaper The Chosun Ilbo  Max Fischer of The Washington Post has written that  almost any story  on North Korea  is treated as broadly credible  no matter how outlandish or thinly sourced   Occasional deliberate disinformation on the part of North Korean establishments further complicates the issue   8 5  Cuisine  Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change  Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in southern Manchuria and the Korean peninsula  it has gone through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends  Rice dishes and kimchi are staple Korean food  In a traditional meal  they accompany both side dishes  panch an  and main courses like juk  pulgogi or noodles  Soju liquor is the best known traditional Korean spirit   North Korea s most famous restaurant  Okryugwan  is known for its raengmyeon cold noodles  Other dishes served there include gray mullet soup with boiled rice  beef rib soup  green bean pancake  sinsollo and dishes made from terrapin  Okryugwan sends research teams into the countryside to collect data on Korean cuisine and introduce new recipes  Some Asian cities host branches of the Pyongyang restaurant chain where waitresses perform music and dance   8 6  Sports  North Koreans have an almost obsessive sports mentality and most schools have daily practice in association football  basketball  table tennis  gymnastics  boxing and others  The DPR Korea League is popular inside the country and its games are often televised  The national football team  Chollima  competed in the FIFA World Cup in 2010  when it lost all three matches against Brazil  Portugal and Ivory Coast  Its 1966 appearance was much more successful  seeing a surprise 1 0 victory over Italy and a quarter final loss to Portugal by 3 5  A national team represents the nation in international basketball competitions as well  In December 2013  former American basketball professional Dennis Rodman visited North Korea to help train the national team after he developed a friendship with Kim Jong un   North Korea s first appearance in the Olympics came in 1964  The 1972 Olympics saw its summer games debut and five medals  including one gold  With the exception of the boycotted Los Angeles and Seoul Olympics  North Korean athletes have won medals in all summer games since then  Weightlifter Kim Un guk broke the world record of the Men s 62 kg category at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London  Successful Olympians receive luxury apartments from the state in recognition for their achievements   The Arirang Festival has been recognized by the Guinness World Records as the biggest choreographic event in the world  Some 100 000 athletes perform rhythmic gymnastics and dances while another 40 000 participants create a vast animated screen in the background  The event is an artistic representation of the country s history and pays homage to Kim Il sung and Kim Jong il  Rungrado 1st of May Stadium  the largest stadium in the world with its capacity of 150 000  hosts the Festival  The Pyongyang Marathon is another notable sports event  It is a IAAF Bronze Label Race where amateur runners from around the world can participate   9  See also  Index of North Korea related articles  List of documentary films about North Korea  North Korea Uncovered
