Tax Freedom Day is a US concept relating to taxation  It is the first day of the year in which a nation as a whole has theoretically earned enough income to pay its taxes   Every dollar that is officially considered income by the government is counted  and every payment to the government that is officially considered a tax is counted  Taxes at all levels of government—local  state and federal—are included   1  Purpose  According to Neil Veldhuis  Director of Fiscal Studies  Fraser Institute  the purpose of Tax Freedom Day is to provide citizens of tax paying countries with a metric with which to estimate their  total tax bill   The premise is that by comparing the benefits received by citizens to the amount they pay in taxes  the value of paying taxes can be assessed   2  History and methodology  The concept of Tax Freedom Day was developed in 1948 by Florida businessman Dallas Hostetler  who trademarked the phrase  Tax Freedom Day  and calculated it each year for the next two decades  In 1971  Hostetler retired and transferred the trademark to the Tax Foundation  The Tax Foundation has calculated Tax Freedom Day for the United States ever since  using it as a tool for illustrating the proportion of national income diverted to fund the annual cost of government programs  In 1990  the Tax Foundation began calculating the specific Tax Freedom Day for each individual state   Tax Freedom Day should be amended to account for the transfers of value from the people to the government  debt and inflation  These forms of wealth transfers benefit the government immediately and have a delayed effect on the people   Debt is the tax on future labor  Governments secure debts by promising creditors to service and repay debts by taxing future labor  Since the US Federal Government is deficit spending about 43 cents per dollar  Tax Freedom Day should be calculated over a month later   Inflation or currency debasement decreases the value of savings by printing money not backed by the value of labor  gold  or other tangible asset  Printing wealth for itself  government decreases the wealth created by people laboring  This tax on future labor is most easily measured by increasing gasoline prices from $1 03 in 1998 to $3 30 in 2012  As the value of currency decreases  commodity prices increase   2 1  Leap year effects  Leap years have one day more  29 February  This creates some bias in Tax Freedom Day charts  However  this bias is equal to roughly 1 366  which is about 0 27%   3  United States  In the United States  it is annually calculated by the Tax Foundation 舑 a neoconservative Washington  D C  based tax research organization  In the U S   Tax Freedom Day for 2010 is April 3  for a total average effective tax rate of 26 9 percent of the nation s income  The latest that Tax Freedom Day has occurred was May 1 in 2000  In 1900  Tax Freedom Day arrived January 22  for an effective average total tax rate of 5 9 percent of the nation s income  According to the Tax Foundation  the most important factor driving changes in Tax Freedom Day from year to year is growth in incomes  as the progressive structure of the U S  federal tax system causes taxes as a percentage of income to rise along with inflation   Tax Freedom Day varies among the 50 U S  states  as incomes and state & local taxes differ from state to state  In 2010  Alaska had the lowest total tax burden  earning enough to pay all their tax obligations by March 26  Connecticut had the heaviest tax burden—Tax Freedom Day there arrived April 27  New Jersey had the second heaviest tax burden  having to work until April 25 to pay their total taxes   According to the Tax Foundation  the following is a list of Tax Freedom Days in the U S  since 1900   4  Tax Freedom Day around the world  Many other organizations in countries throughout the world now produce their own  Tax Freedom Day  analysis  According to the Tax Foundation  Tax Freedom Day reports are currently being published in eight countries  Due to the different ways that nations collect and categorize public finance data  however  Tax Freedom Days are not comparable from one country to another   4 1  Tax Freedom Day for workers in the European Union  A 2010 study published in L Anglophone  a Brussels newspaper  compared the tax burdens of  Average Joes  in each of the 27 EU member states and projected the Tax Freedom Day for workers earning a typical wage  Income taxes  social security contributions  by the employee and the employer  and projected VAT contributions were included in the calculations   Regarding the discrepancy between their calculation of August 3 as the typical Belgian worker s Tax Freedom Day and that of PriceWaterhouseCoopers  PWC   L Anglophone s authors wrote    PWC s  figures count revenue from all taxes  including those on corporate profits  petrol  cigarettes  &c   and thus present a more complete picture of the country’s total tax burden   adding that it is  an average applied to all Belgians – not all Belgian workers  in 2008  less than half of Belgium’s population  4 99 million working out of 10 67 million citizens  was legally working  Consequently  a huge share of Belgium’s tax burden is borne by the working population    5  Criticism  In the book Filthy Lucre  Joseph Heath criticizes the idea that tax paying is inherently different from consumption   It would make just as much sense to declare an annual  mortgage freedom day   in order to let mortgage owners know what day they  stop working for the bank and start working for themselves      But who cares  Homeowners are not really  working for the bank   they re merely financing their own consumption  After all  they re the ones living in the house  not the bank manager   5 1  Mathematical  For Canada the Fraser Institute also includes a “Personal Tax Freedom Day Calculator” that estimates a customized Tax Freedom Day based on additional variables such as age of household head  sex of household head  marital status and number of children  However  the Fraser Institute s figures have been disputed  For example  a 2005 study by Osgoode Hall Law Professor Neil Brooks argues the Fraser Institute s Tax Freedom Day analysis includes flawed accounting  including the exclusion of several important forms of income and overstating tax figures  moving the date nearly two months later   In America  while Tax Freedom Day presents an  average American  tax burden  it is not a tax burden typical for an American  That is  the tax burdens of most Americans are substantially overstated by Tax Freedom Day  The larger tax bills associated with higher incomes increases the average tax burden above that of most Americans   Another criticism is that the calculation includes capital gains taxes but not capital gains income  thus overstating the tax burden  For example  in the late 1990s the US Tax Freedom Day moved later  reaching its latest date ever in 2000  but this was largely due to capital gains taxes on the bull market of that era rather than an increase in tax rates  In other words  variations in capital gains income and their associated taxes cause changes in the amount of taxes  but not in the income used in the calculation of Tax Freedom Day   The Tax Foundation defends its methodology by pointing out that Tax Freedom Day is the U S  economy s overall average tax burden—not the tax burden of the  average  American  which is how it is often misinterpreted by members of the media  Tax Foundation materials do not use the phrase  tax burden of the average American   although members of the media often make this mistake   Secondly  the Tax Foundation argues that the Tax Freedom Day calculation does not include capital gains as income because it uses income and tax data directly from the Bureau of Economic Analysis  BEA   BEA has never counted capital gains as income since they don t represent current production available to pay taxes  and so the Tax Foundation excludes them as well  Additionally  the Tax Foundation argues that the exclusion of capital gains income is irrelevant in most years since including capital gains would only shift Tax Freedom Day by 1 percent in either direction in most years  A 1 percent change would represent 3 65 days  From 1968 to 2009 the date has never left the 21 day range of April 13 to May 3   6  See also  List of countries by tax rates  List of countries by tax revenue as percentage of GDP  Rahn curve  Government spending  Laffer curve  7  Notes  8
