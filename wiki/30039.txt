Triumph of the Will    is a 1935 propaganda film directed  produced  edited and co written by Leni Riefenstahl  It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg  which was attended by more than 700 000 Nazi supporters  The film contains excerpts from speeches given by Nazi leaders at the Congress  including Adolf Hitler  Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher  interspersed with footage of massed Sturmabteilung and Schutzstaffel troops and public reaction  Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer  his name appears in the opening titles  The film s overriding theme is the return of Germany as a great power  with Hitler as the leader who will bring glory to the nation  Because the film was made after the 1934 Night of the Long Knives  on June 30  many prominent Sturmabteilung  SA  members are absent since they were murdered in that Party purge organized and orchestrated by Hitler to replace the SA  led by his rival Ernst Roehm  with the Schutzstaffeln  SS  as his main instrument of mass terror   Triumph of the Will was released in 1935 and became a prominent example of propaganda in film history  Riefenstahl s techniques—such as moving cameras  aerial photography  the use of long focus lenses to create a distorted perspective  and the revolutionary approach to the use of music and cinematography—have earned Triumph of the Will recognition as one of the greatest films in history  Riefenstahl helped to stage the scenes  directing and rehearsing some of them at least fifty times  Riefenstahl won several awards  not only in Germany but also in the United States  France  Sweden  and other countries  The film was popular in the Third Reich  and has continued to influence movies  documentaries  and commercials to this day  However  it is banned from showing in Germany owing to its support for Nazism and its numerous portrayals of the swastika   An earlier film by Riefenstahl—Der Sieg des Glaubens—showed Hitler and SA leader Ernst Röhm together at the 1933 Nazi party congress  After Röhm s murder  the party attempted the destruction of all copies  leaving only one known to have survived in Britain  This can be viewed at the Internet Archive  The direction and sequencing of images is almost the same as that Riefenstahl used in Triumph of the Will a year later   Frank Capra s seven film series Why We Fight is said to have been directly inspired by  and the United States  response to  Triumph of the Will   1  Synopsis  The film begins with a prologue  the only commentary in the film  It consists of the following text  shown sequentially  against a grey background   Day 1  The film opens with shots of the clouds above the city  and then moves through the clouds to float above the assembling masses below  with the intention of portraying beauty and majesty of the scene  The cruciform shadow of Hitler s plane is visible as it passes over the tiny figures marching below  accompanied by an orchestral arrangement of the Horst Wessel Lied  Upon arriving at the Nuremberg airport  Hitler and other Nazi leaders emerge from his plane to thunderous applause and a cheering crowd  He is then driven into Nuremberg  through equally enthusiastic people  to his hotel where a night rally is later held   Day 2  The second day begins with images of Nuremberg at dawn  accompanied by an extract from the Act III Prelude  Wach Auf   of Richard Wagner s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg  Following this is a montage of the attendees preparing for the opening of the Reich Party Congress  and footage of the top Nazi officials arriving at the Luitpold Arena  The film then cuts to the opening ceremony  where Rudolf Hess announces the start of the Congress  The camera then introduces much of the Nazi hierarchy and covers their opening speeches  including Joseph Goebbels  Alfred Rosenberg  Hans Frank  Fritz Todt  Robert Ley  and Julius Streicher  Then the film cuts to an outdoor rally for the Reichsarbeitsdienst  Labor Service   which is primarily a series of pseudo military drills by men carrying spades  This is also where Hitler gives his first speech on the merits of the Labor Service and praising them for their work in rebuilding Germany  The day then ends with a torchlight SA parade in which Viktor Lutze speaks to the crowds   Day 3  The third day starts with a Hitler Youth rally on the parade ground  Again the camera covers the Nazi dignitaries arriving and the introduction of Hitler by Baldur von Schirach  Hitler then addresses the Youth  describing in militaristic terms how they must harden themselves and prepare for sacrifice  Everyone present  including General Werner von Blomberg  then assemble for a military pass and review  featuring Wehrmacht cavalry and various armored vehicles  That night Hitler delivers another speech to low ranking party officials by torchlight  commemorating the first year since the Nazis took power and declaring that the party and state are one entity   Day 4  The fourth day is the climax of the film  where the most memorable of the imagery is presented  Hitler  flanked by Heinrich Himmler and Viktor Lutze  walks through a long wide expanse with over 150 000 SA and SS troops standing at attention  to lay a wreath at a World War I Memorial  Hitler then reviews the parading SA and SS men  following which Hitler and Lutze deliver a speech where they discuss the Night of the Long Knives purge of the SA several months prior  Lutze reaffirms the SA s loyalty to the regime  and Hitler absolves the SA of any crimes committed by Ernst Röhm  New party flags are consecrated by letting them touch the Blutfahne  the same cloth flag said to have been carried by the fallen Nazis during the Beer Hall Putsch  and  following a final parade in front of the Nuremberg Frauenkirche  Hitler delivers his closing speech  In it he reaffirms the primacy of the Nazi Party in Germany  declaring   All loyal Germans will become National Socialists  Only the best National Socialists are party comrades   Hess then leads the assembled crowd in a final Sieg Heil salute for Hitler  marking the close of the party congress  The entire crowd sings the Horst Wessel Lied as the camera focuses on the giant Swastika banner  which fades into a line of silhouetted men in Nazi party uniforms  marching in formation as the lyrics  Comrades shot by the Red Front and the Reactionaries march in spirit together in our columns  are sung   2  Origins  Riefenstahl  a popular German actress  had directed her first movie called Das blaue Licht  The Blue Light  in 1932  Around the same time she first heard Hitler speak at a Nazi rally and  by her own admission  was impressed  She later began a correspondence with him that would last for years  Hitler  by turn  was equally impressed with Das blaue Licht  and in 1933 asked her to direct a film about the Nazis  annual Nuremberg Rally  The Nazis had only recently taken power amid a period of political instability  Hitler was the fourth Chancellor of Germany in less than a year  and were considered an unknown quantity by many Germans  to say nothing of the world   In Mein Kampf  Hitler talks of the success of British propaganda in World War I  believing people s ignorance meant simple repetition and an appeal to feelings over reason would suffice  Hitler chose Riefenstahl as he wanted the film as  artistically satisfying  as possible to appeal to a non political audience  but he also believed that propaganda must admit no element of doubt  As such  Triumph of the Will may be seen as a continuation of the unambiguous World War I style propaganda  though heightened by the film s artistic or poetic nature   Riefenstahl was initially reluctant  not because of any moral qualms  but because she wanted to continue making feature films  Hitler persisted and Riefenstahl eventually agreed to make a film at the 1933 Nuremberg Rally called Der Sieg des Glaubens  Victory of Faith   However the film had numerous technical problems  including a lack of preparation  Riefenstahl reported having just a few days  and Hitler s apparent unease at being filmed  To make matters worse  Riefenstahl had to deal with infighting by party officials  in particular Joseph Goebbels who tried to have the film released by the Propaganda Ministry  Though Der Sieg des Glaubens apparently did well at the box office  it later became a serious embarrassment to the Nazis after SA Leader Ernst Röhm  who had a prominent role in the film  was executed during the Night of the Long Knives  All references to Röhm were ordered to be erased from German history  which included the destruction of all known copies of Der Sieg des Glaubens   In 1934  Riefenstahl had no wish to repeat the fiasco of Der Sieg des Glaubens and initially recommended fellow director Walter Ruttmann  Ruttmann s film  which would have covered the rise of the Nazi Party from 1923 to 1934 and been more overtly propagandistic  the opening text of Triumph of the Will was his   did not appeal to Hitler  He again asked Riefenstahl  who finally relented  there is still debate over how willing she was  after Hitler guaranteed his personal support and promised to keep other Nazi organizations  specifically the Propaganda Ministry  from meddling with her film   3  Production  The film follows a script similar to Der Sieg des Glaubens  which is evident when one sees both films side by side  For example  the city of Nuremberg scenes   even to the shot of a cat included in the city driving sequence in both films  Furthermore  Herbert Windt reused much of his musical score for that film in Triumph des Willens  which he also scored  But unlike Der Sieg des Glaubens  Riefenstahl shot Triumph of the Will with a large budget  extensive preparations  and vital help from high ranking Nazis like Goebbels  As Susan Sontag observed   The Rally was planned not only as a spectacular mass meeting  but as a spectacular propaganda film   Albert Speer  Hitler s personal architect  designed the set in Nuremberg and did most of the coordination for the event  Pits were dug in front of the speakers  platform so Riefenstahl could get the camera angles she wanted  and tracks were laid so that her cameramen could get traveling shots of the crowd  When rough cuts weren t up to par  major party leaders and high ranking public officials reenacted their speeches in a studio for her  Riefenstahl also used a film crew that was extravagant by the standards of the day  Her crew consisted of 172 people  including 10 technical staff  36 cameramen and assistants  operating in 16 teams with 30 cameras   nine aerial photographers  17 newsreel men  12 newsreel crew  17 lighting men  two photographers  26 drivers  37 security personnel  four labor service workers  and two office assistants  Many of her cameramen also dressed in SA uniforms so they could blend into the crowds   Riefenstahl had the difficult task of condensing an estimated 61 hours of film into two hours  She labored to complete the film as fast as she could  going so far as to sleep in the editing room filled with hundreds of thousands of feet of film footage   4  Themes  4 1  Religion  Triumph of the Will is sometimes seen as an example of Nazi political religion  The primary religion in Germany before the Second World War was Christianity  With the primary sects being Roman Catholic and Protestant  the Christian views in this movie are clearly meant to allow the movie to better connect with the intended audience   Religion is a major theme in Triumph of the Will  The film opens with Hitler descending god like out of the skies past twin cathedral spires  It contains many scenes of church bells ringing  and individuals in a state of near religious fervor  as well as a prominent shot of Reich Protestant Bishop Ludwig Müller standing in his vestments among high ranking Nazis  It is probably not a coincidence that the final parade of the film was held in front of the Nuremberg Frauenkirche  In his final speech in the film  Hitler also directly compares the Nazi party to a holy order  and the consecration of new party flags by having Hitler touch them to the  blood banner  has obvious religious overtones  Hitler himself is portrayed in a messianic manner  from the opening where he descends from the clouds in a plane  to his drive through Nuremberg where even a cat stops what it is doing to watch him  to the many scenes where the camera films from below and looks up at him  Hitler  standing on his podium  will issue a command to hundreds of thousands of followers  The audience happily complies in unison  As Frank P  Tomasulo comments   Hitler is cast as a veritable German Messiah who will save the nation  if only the citizenry will put its destiny in his hands    4 2  Power  Germany had not seen images of military power and strength since the end of World War I  and the huge formations of men would remind the audience that Germany was becoming a great power once again  Though the Labor Service men carried spades  they handled them as if they were rifles  The Eagles and Swastikas could be seen as a reference to the Roman Legions of antiquity  The large mass of well drilled party members could be seen in a more ominous light  as a warning to dissidents thinking of challenging the regime   Hitler s arrival in an airplane should also be viewed in this context  According to Kenneth Poferl   Flying in an airplane was a luxury known only to a select few in the 1930s  but Hitler had made himself widely associated with the practice  having been the first politician to campaign via air travel  Victory reinforced this image and defined him as the top man in the movement  by showing him as the only one to arrive in a plane and receive an individual welcome from the crowd  Hitler s speech to the SA also contained an implied threat  if he could have Röhm  the commander of the hundreds of thousands of troops on the screen  shot  it was only logical to assume that Hitler could get away with having anyone executed    4 3  Unity  It was very important to Adolf Hitler that his propaganda messages carry a unified theme  If a country isn t unified in saying the enemy is bad  the audience starts to have doubts  Unity is seen throughout this film  even in the camps where soldiers live  The camp outside of Nuremberg is very uniform and clean  the tents are aligned in perfect rows  each one the same as the next  The men there also make a point not to wear their shirts  because their shirts display their rankings and status  Shirtless they are all equals  unified  When they march  it is in unison and they all carry their weapons identically  one to another   Hitler s message to the workers also includes the notion of unity   Children were also used to convey unity   Triumph of the Will has many scenes that blur the distinction between the Nazi Party  the German state  and the German people  Germans in peasant farmers  costumes and other traditional clothing greet Hitler in some scenes  The torchlight processions  though now associated by many with the Nazis  would remind the viewer of the medieval Karneval celebration  The old flag of Imperial Germany is also shown several times flying alongside the Swastika  and there is a ceremony where Hitler pays his respects to soldiers who died in World War I  as well as to President Paul von Hindenburg  who had died a month before the convention   There is also a scene where the Labor Servicemen individually call out which town or area in Germany they are from  reminding the viewers that the Nazi Party had expanded from its stronghold in Bavaria to become a pan German movement   5  Hitler s speeches  Among the themes presented  the desire for pride in Germany and the purification of the German people is well exemplified through the speeches and ideals of the Third Reich in Triumph of the Will   In every speech given and shown in Triumph of the Will  pride is one of the major focuses  Hitler advocates to the people that they should not be satisfied with their current state and they should not be satisfied with the descent from power and greatness Germany has endured since World War I  The German people should believe in themselves and the movement that is occurring in Germany  Hitler promotes pride in Germany through the unification of it  Unifying Germany would force the elimination of what does not amount to the standards of the Nazi regime   To unify Germany  Hitler believes purification would have to take place  This meant not only eliminating the citizens of Germany who are not of the Aryan race  but the sick  weak  handicapped  or any other citizens deemed unhealthy or impure  In Triumph of the Will  Hitler preaches to the people that Germany must take a look at itself and seek out that which does not belong    T he elements that have become bad  and therefore do not belong with us   Though within the context  he seems to be referring to the corrupt elements of the power structure  it later could seem in hindsight to imply that the elimination of the  inferior  people of Germany would  in theory  return Germany to its once prideful and powerful former self  Julius Streicher stresses the importance of purification in his speech  a direct reference to his own virulent anti semitism  Hundreds of thousands mentally sick and disabled would be murdered in the Action T4  a programme run directly from Hitler s Chancellery  Kanzlei des Führers    Hitler preaches to the people in his speeches that they should believe in their country and themselves  The German people are better than what they have become because of the impurities in society  Hitler wants them to believe in him and believe what he wants to do for his people  and what he is doing is for the country s and people s benefit  Hess says in the last scene of Triumph of the Will   Heil Hitler  hail victory  hail victory   Everyone in attendance yells in support  This verbal sign represents their faith to their leader and his most trusted advisors that they believe in the Nazi cause  This is directly following Hitler s yell   Long live the National Socialist Movement  Long live Germany   and the crowd erupts with cheering and the fulfillment of pride for themselves and their political party   In the closing speech of Triumph of the Will  Hitler enters the room from the back  appearing to emerge from the people  After a one sentence introduction  he tells his faithful Nazis how the German nation has subordinated itself to the Nazi Party because its leaders are mostly of Germans  He promises that the new state that the Nazis have created will endure for thousands of years  Hitler says that the youth will carry on after the old have weakened  They close with a chant   Hitler is the Party  Hitler   The camera focuses on the large Swastika above Hitler and the film ends with the images of this Swastika imposed on Nazis marching in a few columns  His speech brought attention to the rally and created a huge turnout in the following years  He attracted many people in the way that he addressed the issues and his people  He spoke to them as if it were a sermon and engaged the people  In 1934  over a million Germans participated in the Nuremberg Rally   6  Response  Triumph of the Will premiered on 28 March 1935 at the Berlin Ufa Palace Theater and was an instant success  Within two months the film had earned 815 000 Reichsmark  and Ufa considered it one of the three most profitable films of that year  Hitler praised the film as being an  incomparable glorification of the power and beauty of our Movement   For her efforts  Riefenstahl was rewarded with the German Film Prize  Deutscher Filmpreis   a gold medal at the 1935 Venice Biennale  and the Grand Prix at the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris  However  there were few claims that the film would result in a mass influx of  converts  to fascism and the Nazis apparently did not make a serious effort to promote the film outside of Germany  Film historian Richard Taylor also said that Triumph of the Will was not generally used for propaganda purposes inside the Third Reich  The Independent wrote in 2003   Triumph of the Will seduced many wise men and women  persuaded them to admire rather than to despise  and undoubtedly won the Nazis friends and allies all over the world    The reception in other countries was not always as enthusiastic  British documentarian Paul Rotha called it tedious  while others were repelled by its pro Nazi sentiments  During World War II  Frank Capra helped to create a direct response  through the film series called Why We Fight  a series of newsreels commissioned by the United States government that spliced in footage from Triumph of the Will  but recontextualized it so that it promoted the cause of the Allies instead  Capra later remarked that Triumph of the Will  fired no gun  dropped no bombs  But as a psychological weapon aimed at destroying the will to resist  it was just as lethal   Clips from Triumph of the Will were also used in an Allied propaganda short called General Adolph Takes Over  set to the British dance tune  The Lambeth Walk   The legions of marching soldiers  as well as Hitler giving his Nazi salute  were made to look like wind up dolls  dancing to the music  The Danish resistance used to take over cinemas and force the projectionist to show Swinging the Lambeth Walk  as it was also known   Erik Barrow has said   The extraordinary risks were apparently felt justified by a moment of savage anti Hitler ridicule   Also during World War II  the poet Dylan Thomas wrote a screenplay for and narrated These Are The Men  a propaganda piece using Triumph of the Will footage to discredit Nazi leadership   One of the best ways to gauge the response to Triumph of the Will was the instant and lasting international fame it gave Riefenstahl  The Economist said it  sealed her reputation as the greatest female filmmaker of the 20th century   For a director who made eight films  only two of which received significant coverage outside of Germany  Riefenstahl had unusually high name recognition for the remainder of her life  most of it stemming from Triumph of the Will  However  her career was also permanently damaged by this association  After the war  Riefenstahl was imprisoned by the Allies for four years for allegedly being a Nazi sympathizer and was permanently blacklisted by the film industry  When she died in 2003–68 years after the film s premiere—her obituary received significant coverage in many major publications  including the Associated Press  The Wall Street Journal  The New York Times  and The Guardian  most of which reaffirmed the importance of Triumph of the Will  Though the actual effectiveness of Triumph of the Will is hard to measure in terms of numbers or statistics that actually state its effectiveness  its response from the people is well documented with the amount of views and the popularity of the movie during the time period   7  Controversy  Like American filmmaker D  W  Griffith s The Birth of a Nation  Triumph of the Will has been criticized as a use of spectacular filmmaking to promote a profoundly unethical system  In Germany  this movie is classified as Nazi propaganda and its showing is restricted under post war denazification laws  but it may be shown in an educational context  In her defense  Riefenstahl claimed that she was naïve about the Nazis when she made it and had no knowledge of Hitler s genocidal or anti semitic policies  She also pointed out that Triumph of the Will contains  not one single antisemitic word   although it does contain a veiled comment by Julius Streicher  the notorious Jew baiter  who was hanged after the Nuremberg trials   that  a people that does not protect its racial purity will perish    However  Roger Ebert has observed that for some   the very absence of anti semitism in Triumph of the Will looks like a calculation  excluding the central motif of almost all of Hitler s public speeches must have been a deliberate decision to make the film more efficient as propaganda    Riefenstahl also repeatedly defended herself against the charge that she was a Nazi propagandist  saying that Triumph of the Will focuses on images over ideas  and should therefore be viewed as a Gesamtkunstwerk  holistic work of art   In 1964  she returned to this topic  saying   However  Riefenstahl was an active participant in the rally  though in later years she downplayed her influence significantly  claiming   I just observed and tried to film it well  The idea that I helped to plan it is downright absurd   Ebert states that Triumph of the Will is  by general consent  one  of the best documentaries ever made   but added that because it reflects the ideology of a movement regarded by many as evil  it poses  a classic question of the contest between art and morality  Is there such a thing as pure art  or does all art make a political statement   When reviewing the film for his  Great Movies  collection  Ebert reversed his opinion  characterizing his earlier conclusion as  the received opinion that the film is great but evil  and calling it  a terrible film  paralyzingly dull  simpleminded  overlong and not even  manipulative   because it is too clumsy to manipulate anyone but a true believer    Susan Sontag considers Triumph of the Will the  most successful  most purely propagandistic film ever made  whose very conception negates the possibility of the filmmaker s having an aesthetic or visual conception independent of propaganda   Sontag points to Riefenstahl s involvement in the planning and design of the Nuremberg ceremonies as evidence that Riefenstahl was working as a propagandist  rather than as an artist in any sense of the word  With some 30 cameras and a crew of 150  the marches  parades  speeches  and processions were orchestrated like a movie set for Riefenstahl s film  Further  this was not the first political film made by Riefenstahl for the Third Reich  there was Victory of Faith  1933   nor was it the last  Day of Freedom  1935  and Olympia  1938    Anyone who defends Riefenstahl s films as documentary   Sontag states   if documentary is to be distinguished from propaganda  is being disingenuous  In Triumph of Will  the document  the image  is no longer simply the record of reality   reality  has been constructed to serve the image    Brian Winston s essay on the film in The Movies as History is largely a critique of Sontag s analysis  Winston argues that any filmmaker could have made the film look impressive because the Nazis  mise en scène was impressive  particularly when they were offering it for camera re stagings  In form  the film alternates repetitively between marches and speeches  Winston asks the viewers to consider if such a film should be seen as anything more than a pedestrian effort  Like Rotha  he finds the film tedious  and believes anyone who takes the time to analyze its structure will quickly agree   7 1  Wehrmacht objections  The first controversy over Triumph of the Will occurred even before its release  when several generals in the Wehrmacht protested over the minimal army presence in the film  Only one scene—the review of the German cavalry—actually involved the German military  The other formations were party organizations that were not part of the military   The opposition of the generals  was not simply out of personalized pique or vanity  As produced by Riefenstahl  Triumph of the Will  posits Germany as a leaderless mass of lost souls without any organizing institutions  or antecedent institutional leaders  And that the “new order” embodied by the Nazi Party and Hitler  provides a both new  and a singular saving leader and institutional framework for the whole of the German nation   The Army however  had been  and  had seen itself as being  an institution that held shared responsibility for the leadership of the nation and state  since at least the time of Fredrick the Great  And that the leaders of that Army  had  also as such  been viewed throughout the history of the German speaking peoples  as an integral part of the leadership cadre  And that what the Nazi Party’s film was arguing  was that the Army by and through its absence  along with other institutions  e g   the nobility  the Church  academia  business  etc   in the film  demonstrated that the Army too  as well as its leaders   was “disappeared”  from what the Army considered to be its shared leadership role in the state  National Socialist or otherwise  notwithstanding  And it was this implied assertion of the film that the Army’s leaders vehemently disagreed with   Hitler proposed his own  artistic  compromise where Triumph of the Will would open with a camera slowly tracking down a row of all the  overlooked  generals  and placate each general s ego   According to her own testimony  Riefenstahl refused his suggestion and insisted on keeping artistic control over Triumph of the Will  She did agree to return to the 1935 rally to make a film exclusively about the Wehrmacht  which became Tag der Freiheit  Unsere Wehrmacht  Day of Freedom  Our Armed Forces    8  Influences and legacy  Triumph of the Will remains well known for its striking visuals  As one historian notes   many of the most enduring images of the  Nazi  regime and its leader derive from Riefenstahl s film    Extensive excerpts of the film were used in Erwin Leiser s documentary Mein Kampf  produced in Sweden in 1960  Riefenstahl unsuccessfully sued the Swedish production company Minerva Film for copyright violation  although she did receive forty thousand marks in compensation from German and Austrian distributors of the film   In 1942  Charles A  Ridley of the British Ministry of Information made a short propaganda film  Lambeth Walk – Nazi Style  which edited footage of Hitler and German soldiers from the film to make it appear they were marching and dancing to the song  The Lambeth Walk   The film so enraged Joseph Goebbels that reportedly he ran out of the screening room kicking chairs and screaming profanities  The propaganda film was distributed uncredited to newsreel companies  who would supply their own narration   Charlie Chaplin s classic satire The Great Dictator  1940  was inspired in large part by Triumph of the Will  The film has been studied by many contemporary artists  including film directors Sir Peter Jackson  George Lucas and Ridley Scott   9  See also  List of German films 1933 1945  Nazism and cinema  Nazi
