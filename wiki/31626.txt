The Book of Ether    is one of the books that make up the Book of Mormon  The Book of Ether tells of an ancient people  the Jaredites   descendants of Jared and his companions who were led by God to the Americas shortly after the confusion of tongues and the destruction of the Tower of Babel   The title refers to Ether  a Jaredite prophet who lived at the end of the time period covered by the book  The time frame for the events in the book have been estimated as starting anywhere from 2600 BC to 2100 BC and extending to some time beyond 600 BC  giving a date range of at least 1500 years  but possibly as long as 2500 years   1  Contents  1 1  The Brother of Jared  The book begins with the journey of Jared and his people from the tumultuous wickedness of the Tower of Babel to  the promised land   The brother of Jared is described as  a large and mighty man     highly favored of the Lord   and seems to have been the spiritual leader of the group  Through his faith  he is given a prophetic vision of the history of the world  and inscribes prophetic writings that are to be  sealed up  until the Lord sees fit that they be revealed  The brother of Jared is directed by the Lord to build unpowered submarines  termed barges  to cross the ocean to the promised land  They are capable of maintaining an air supply underwater by opening a hole   Because the barges wouldn t allow fire or windows for light  the brother of Jared goes to a mountain with several molten stones  then God touches the stones and makes them shine  Because of the great faith of the brother of Jared  he could not be kept from beholding  and saw the finger of the Lord  He saw and was ministered unto by Jesus  He leads the people to successfully establish a righteous nation  but as Jared and his brother grow old their people desire that they appoint a king to govern in their stead  They anoint Orihah  the youngest son of Jared  to be king  but only after all the sons of the brother of Jared and all of Jared s older sons refuse to be king   1 2  Kingdoms  In the days of Com many prophets predicted that the people would face destruction unless they repented  but the people didn t want to hear that and they sought to kill them  so they fled to Com for safety  He took payment in the form of prophecies and he found himself blessed for the rest of his life   Com begat Shiblom and the brother of Shiblom  who made war upon each other  and this war involved the whole land  The brother of Shiblom executed all the prophets who brought bad news about the destruction of the people if the people refused to repent  Following that there was a great destruction        such an one as never had been known upon the face of the earth    Shiblom was slain  so his son Ahah ascended to the throne  He did much iniquity  and the days of his reign were short  His son Ethem also did much iniquity but reigned a bit longer  Just as in the days of Com  many prophets came around predicting that God would wipe the people off the face of the Earth unless they repented  But the people wouldn t listen  so the prophets relented  Ethen did what was wicked before the Lord  and he begat a son Moron  and Moron did what was wicked before the Lord as well   A descendant of Jared overthrew Moron and took his kingdom  Moron was put into jail  and there he begat Coriantor who lived in prison all of his days  Coriantor begat Ether in captivity  Then he died  But Ether could not be restrained because the Holy Spirit dwelt in him  So he came out of prison and preached to the people during the days of the reign of Coriantumr the king   1 3  End of the Jaredites  Moroni commits to plates the tale of the destruction of the Jaredites  They had rejected the words of Ether  that their land was chosen of God for those who serve him  and it would be the place of the New Jerusalem that would come down from heaven and be the dwelling place of the Lord  And Ether said that the old Jerusalem would be built up again in Israel  and the inhabitants of the New Jerusalem would fulfil the covenant God made with Abraham   Coriamtumr did not repent  and sought to capture Ether  but Ether fled to a cave and watched everything from afar  and recorded it   A man named Shared rose up and gave battle to Coriamtumr  and brought him into captivity  but the sons of Coriamtumr released him  Coriamtumr came again after Shared with his armies  and they met in the valley of Gilgal  and Shared was driven to the plains of Heshlon  Then Shared turned and fought Coriamtumr  and drove him back to the valley of Gilgal   The next time they fought in the valley of Gilgal  Coriantumr slew Shared  but Shared wounded Coriantumr in his thigh  which took him out of commission for two years  And there was a curse on the land so that when people set objects down at night  in the morning they disappeared  So everyone started keeping their worldly goods and weapons on their own person   Then the brother of Shared  who was named Gilead  gave battle to Coriantumr  and was driven to the wilderness of Akish  But the brother of Shared waylaid a part of the army of Coriantumr because they were drunken  And he went to the land of Moron and placed himself on Coriantumr s throne  Meanwhile  Coriantumr stayed with his army in the field for two years   Gilead s high priest murdered him as he sat upon the throne of Coriantumr  Then Lib was elevated to king just in time for Coriantumr to come back to Moron and give battle  Lib wounded him in the arm  but the army of Coriantumr drove the army of Lib to the shore of the sea   But the army of Lib smote the army of Coriantumr and drove them through the wilderness of Akish to the plains of Agosh  On the plains of Agosh Coriantumr smote upon Lib until he died  but Lib s brother Shiz rose up in his place and gave battle  causing Coriantumr to flee   Shiz chased after Coriantumr  burned down many cities  and slew women and children  And all the people in the land flocked into either the army of Shiz or the army of Coriantumr  The war had been so bloody that the whole face of the land was covered with dead bodies  and no one took the time to bury them because they were busy marching to slay more people  And the land stank   Shiz pursued Coriantumr to the seashore and gave battle for three days  The people of Shiz grew frightened and fled to the land of Corihor  while Coriantumr pitched his tents in the valley of Shurr  and assembled his army on the hill of Comnor hard by   In the battle Shiz smote upon Coriantumr with many wounds  and Coriantumr fainted from the loss of blood and was carried away  Casualties were so high on both sides that Shiz ordered his people not to pursue the armies of Coriantumr   When Coriantumr recovered from his wounds  he remembered the words of Ether and saw that two million of his men had been slain already  and also their families  and he realized that the prophesies had been fulfilled to the letter  So Coriantumr wrote a message to Shiz that he ought to resign for the sake of the lives of his people  Shiz said no   Then Shiz wrote a message to Coriantumr that if he game himself up  he would spare the lives of the people  Coriantumr said no  So the people of Coriantumr gave battle to the people of Shiz  But when Coriantumr saw that he was about to be defeated he fled from the armies of Shiz   They came to the river Ripliancum  which was the greatest river in the land  In the morning the armies fought  Coriantumr was wounded in battle and fainted with the loss of blood  After that  the armies of Coriantumr drove the armies of Shiz southward to Ogath  The army of Coriantumr camped at the hill Ramah  which is also the hill Cumorah  where Mormon hid the plates of Nephi and where another battle would take place that would result in 240 000 deaths   Four years were spent by both sides mustering all the people for the fight  Every single one who still lived would  except Ether  who would be an observer   All the people in the land fought at the hill Ramah  or Cumorah   Men  women  and children were all armed with weapons and wore armor  Men killed women and children as well as other men  Mothers killed other mothers and their children  The children of Coriantumr killed the children of Shiz  and vice versa  so much did they hate each other   After that day s fighting  Coriantumr wrote a message to Shiz to the effect that he didn t want to fight anymore  but Shiz didn t agree to stop  The next day they fought again until there were 69 folks with Shiz who were still alive  and 52 folks with Coriantumr  The next day after that they fought again until there were 32 folks with Shiz who were still alive  and 27 folks with Coriantumr   Shiz and his men chased down Coriantumr and his men  and they fought until only Shiz and Coriantumr still lived  Then Coriantumr gained so many hits on Shiz that Shiz passed out from the loss of blood  Then Coriantumr smote off the head of Shiz   And it came to pass that after he had smitten off the head of Shiz  that Shiz raised upon his hands and fell  and after that he had struggled for breath  he died    After Coriantumr slew Shiz  he wanders alone  the last Jaredite  for many years  Coriantumr is finally discovered by the Mulekites  another Book of Mormon people who come to the Americas sometime after the fall of Jerusalem in 600 B C  Later  the people of Zarahemla also discover a large stone containing a history of the Jaredites that Mosiah was able to translate   In addition to the historical events outlined above  the Book of Ether contains several interpolations by Moroni  regarding points of doctrine or lessons illuminated by the actions of the Jaredites  such as how faith works and the importance of following Jesus Christ to be blessed as a nation   2  Parallels  The Book of Ether parallels in many ways the story of the Book of Mormon as a whole  A small group  Jared and his companions  Lehi and his family  separate themselves from a wicked society  the Tower of Babel  Jerusalem just prior to its destruction  and establish a new nation  the Jaredites  the Nephites  in  the promised land   In each case the group is divided following the death of the original leaders and the divisions contend for many generations  The fortunes of the nations are dependent upon their obedience to God—righteousness brings prosperity and wickedness brings destruction  sometimes delayed   Ultimately  the wicked prevail and the nation is destroyed   These parallels are often emphasized in Mormonism as applicable to the present day  The Americas are still considered  the promised land  and the continued prosperity of the present nations are believed to be contingent on the righteousness of their people   3  Provenance  According to the Book of Mormon  the Book of Ether was taken from a set of twenty four plates written by Ether and discovered by the people of Limhi during the time of King Mosiah  son of King Benjamin   The book was abridged by Moroni onto the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon was later translated into English by Joseph Smith  However  according to Daniel H  Ludlow  it is not made absolutely clear in the Book of Mormon whether Moroni made his abridgment of the record of Ether from Mosiah s earlier translation  see   or whether Moroni took his account directly from the plates of Ether  in which case he would have needed to translate the record as well as abridge it   4  Criticism  There are several anachronisms in the Book of Ether  Those that are most cited are found in Ether Chapter 9 verses 18 and 19   18  And also all manner of cattle  of oxen  and cows  and of sheep  and of swine  and of goats  and also many other kinds of animals which were useful for the food of man   19  And they also had horses  and asses  and there were elephants and cureloms and cumoms  all of which were useful unto man  and more especially the elephants and cureloms and cumoms   There is no evidence that elephants ever lived in North or South America and the fossil evidence suggests that mammoths died out long before the time the Jaredites would have arrived  There is also no evidence that horses  swine or cattle were ever in the Americas prior to Columbus   5  See also  Archaeology and the Book of Mormon  Columbian Exchange  Dené–Yeniseian languages  Genetics
