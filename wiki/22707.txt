Oolong    is a traditional Chinese tea  Camellia sinensis  produced through a unique process including withering the plant under the strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting  Most oolong teas  especially those of fine quality  involve unique tea plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties  The degree of oxidation can range from 8 to 85%  depending on the variety and production style  Oolong is especially popular with tea connoisseurs of south China and Chinese expatriates in Southeast Asia  as is the Fujian preparation process known as the Gongfu tea ceremony   In Chinese tea culture  semi oxidised oolong teas are collectively grouped as qīngchá     The taste of oolong varies widely among different subvarieties  It can be sweet and fruity with honey aromas  or woody and thick with roasted aromas  or green and fresh with bouquet aromas  all depending on the horticulture and style of production  Several subvarieties of oolong  including those produced in the Wuyi Mountains of northern Fujian  such as Da Hong Pao  are among the most famous Chinese teas   Different varieties of oolong are processed differently  but the leaves are formed into one of two distinct styles  Some are rolled into long curly leaves  while others are  wrap curled  into small beads  each with a tail  The former style is the more traditional of the two in China   The name oolong tea came into the English language from the Chinese name     meaning  black dragon    1  Possible origins  There are three widely accepted explanations of the origin of the Chinese name  According to the  tribute tea  theory  oolong tea came directly from Dragon Phoenix Tea Cake tribute tea  The term oolong tea replaced the old term when loose tea came into fashion  Since it was dark  long  and curly  it was called Black Dragon tea   According to the  Wuyi  theory  oolong tea first existed in the Wuyi Mountains region  This is evidenced by Qing dynasty poems such as Wuyi Tea Song  Wuyi Chage  and Tea Tale  Chashuo   It was said that oolong tea was named after the part of the Wuyi Mountain where it was originally produced   According to the  Anxi  theory  oolong tea had its origin in the Anxi oolong tea plant  which was discovered by a man named Sulong  Wulong  or Wuliang   Another tale tells of a man named Wu Liang  later corrupted to Wu Long  or Oolong  who discovered oolong tea by accident when he was distracted by a deer after a hard day s tea picking  and by the time he remembered to return to the tea it had already started to oxidize   2  Varieties  Sikkim Temi

Guānyīn variety  There was once a poor farmer who was devout and dedicated to maintaining the temple of Kuan Yin  the goddess of mercy  One day  to reward him for his loyalty and commitment to her  she told him that the key to his future was outside the temple  Outside he found a scrungy old bush  which he nursed to a flourishing bloom of greenish leaves   2 3  Guangdong province    Single Bush

various flowers and fruits  such as orange blossom  orchid  grapefruit  almond  ginger flower  etc   The name dan cong is often misinterpreted as meaning the tea is all picked from a single bush  grove  or clone  This is not correct  Dan cong is a botanical term that refers to the morphology of the tea plant  Most tea bushes emerge from the ground as a cluster of branches  however  the uncommon dan cong variety emerges as a single trunk that branches off higher up the stem  Also  some tea plants are found in the form of a long  dark green vine that wraps itself around guava trees
