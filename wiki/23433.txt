This article is about the demographic features of the population of Peru  including population density  ethnicity  education level  health of the populace  economic status  religious affiliations and other aspects of the population   Peru is a multiethnic country  which means that it is home to people of many different historical backgrounds  Therefore  it is a multicultural country as well  Since it is a multiethnic society  Peruvian people usually treat their nationality as a citizenship instead of an ethnicity  The Peruvian census does not contain information about ethnicity so only rough estimates are available   1  Population  According to the 2010 revison of the World Population Prospects the total population was 29 077 000 in 2010  compared to only 7 632 000 in 1950  The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 30%  63 9% was between 15 and 65 years of age  while 6 1% was 65 years or older    2  Vital statistics  Registration of vital events is in Peru not complete  The Population Departement of the United Nations prepared the following estimates   2 1  Fertility and Births  Total Fertility Rate  TFR  and Crude Birth Rate  CBR    3  Metropolitan areas  The metropolitan areas of Peru have been formed from the urban growth of Peruvian cities more populated and they are formed by the integration of two or more municipalities  The most populated Peruvian metropolises by districts are  Lima  Trujillo  Chiclayo and Arequipa   4  Ethnic groups  Peru is a multiethnic country formed by the amalgamation of different cultures and ethnicities over thousands of years  Amerindians inhabited the land for over ten millennia before the Spanish conquest in the 16th century  their cultures and influence represent the foundation of today’s Peru   As a result of European contact and conquest  the population of the area now known as Peru decreased from an estimated 9 million in the 1520s to around 600 000 in 1620  This happened mostly because of the unintended spread of germs and infectious diseases  In fact  the spread of smallpox greatly weakened the Inca empire  even before the Spanish arrival  The Amerindians did not have as much natural immunity to the disease as did the Europeans who had been exposed to smallpox for roughly two centuries  For this reason  several Amerindian populations were decimated  Furthermore  the disease killed Inca ruler Wayna Capac  triggering a civil war in the Inca empire that preceded the conquest efforts the Spaniards  Thus  the conquest was facilitated by the weakness of the Inca empire which was recovering from both a civil war and epidemics of unknown diseases  However  other reasons for the decrease of Amerindian population include the battles for domination and survival  followed by the breakdown of the Inca social system  famine  genocide  human exploitation  and forced mine labor to extract the gold and silver to ship back to Europe  Forced labor started after the settlement of the Spanish  The Amerindian population suffered further decrease as the Spanish exploited an Inca communal labor system called mita for mining purposes  thus annihilating thousands in forced labor   Spaniards arrived in large numbers under colonial rule  After the independence  there has been a gradual European immigration from Austria  England  France  Germany  Italy  Croatia and Spain  Polynesians also came to the country lured to work in the Guano islands during the boom years of this commodity around the 1860s  Chinese arrived in the 1850s as a replacement for slave workers in the sugar plantations of the north coast and have since become a major influence in Peruvian society  Other immigrant groups include Arabs  South Asians  Japanese and Americans from the United States   Mestizos compose about 45% of the total population  The term traditionally denotes Amerindian and European ancestry  mostly Spaniard ancestry and to a lesser degree  Italian   This term  was part of the caste classification during colonial times  whereby people of exclusive Spanish descend but born in the colonies were called criollos  people of mixed Amerindian and Spanish descend were called mestizos  those of African and Spanish descend were called mulatos and those of Amerindian and African descend were called zambos  Nowadays  these terms have racist connotations   Most Peruvian mestizos are of Amerindian and European descent  but other ethnic backgrounds  such as Asian  Middle Eastern and African  are also present  in varying degrees  in some segments of the mestizo population  Most mestizos are urban dwellers and show stronger European inheritance in regions like Lima Region  La Libertad Region  Callao Region  Pasco Region  Cajamarca Region  Piura Region  Lambayeque Region  and Arequipa Region   Amerindians constitute around 37 % of the total population  The two major indigenous or ethnic groups are the Quechuas  belonging to various cultural subgroups   followed by the Aymaras  mostly found in the extreme southern Andes  A large proportion of the indigenous population who live in the Andean highlands still speak Quechua or Aymara  and have vibrant cultural traditions  some of which were part of the Inca Empire  arguably the most advanced agricultural civilization in the world  Literally dozens of indigenous cultures are also dispersed throughout the country beyond the Andes Mountains in the Amazon basin  This region is rapidly becoming urbanized  Important urban centers include Iquitos  Nauta  Puerto Maldonado  Pucallpa and Yurimaguas  This region is home to numerous indigenous peoples  though they do not constitute a large proportion of the total population  Examples of indigenous peoples residing in eastern Peru include the Shipibo  Urarina  Cocama  and Aguaruna  to name just a few   European descendants constitute around 15% of the total population  They are descendants of the Spanish colonizers and other Europeans such as Italians  British  French  Germans  Jews and Croatians  see also Croats  who arrived in the 19th and 20th centuries  The majority of them live also in the largest cities  like mestizos   usually in the North and Center of Peru  Lima  Trujillo  Chiclayo  Piura  Cajamarca and San Martin  The only southern city with a significant white population is Arequipa  Recently  Peru has seen a migration of American retirees and businessmen come to settle in the country  due to lower cost of living and economic booms in the 1990s and 2000s  though Peru experiences busts in between   There is also a large presence of Asian Peruvians  primarily Chinese and Japanese along with recent arrived Koreans and other Asian immigrants  that constitutes 3% of the population  which in proportion to the overall population is the second largest of any Latin American nation  after Panama  Peru has the second largest population of people of Japanese descent in Latin America after Brazil and the largest population of Chinese descent in Latin America  Historic communities inhabited by people of Chinese descent are found throughout the Peruvian upper Amazon  including cities such as Yurimaguas  Nauta  Iquitos and the north central coast  Lambayeque and Trujillo   In contrast to the Japanese community in Peru  the Chinese appear to have intermarried much more since they came to work in the rice fields during the Viceroyalty and to replace the African slaves  during the abolition of slavery itself  Despite the presence of Peruvians of Asian heritage being quite recent  in the past decade they have made significant advancements in business and political fields  a past president  Alberto Fujimori   several past cabinet members  and one member of the Peruvian congress are of Japanese or Chinese origin  Small numbers of Arab Peruvians  mostly of Lebanese and Syrian origin  and Palestinians also reside  as well a small Hindustani and Pakistani community   The remaining is constituted by Afro Peruvians  a legacy of Peru s history as an importer of slaves during the colonial period  Today also mulattos  mixed African and European  and zambos  mixed African and Amerindian  constitute an important part of the population as well  especially in Piura  Tumbes  Lambayeque  Lima and Ica regions  The Afro Peruvian population is concentrated mostly in coastal cities south of Lima  such as that of those found in the Ica Region  in cities like Cañete  Chincha  Ica  Nazca and Acarí in the border with the Arequipa Region  Another large but poorly promoted segment of Afro Peruvian presence is in the Yunga regions  west and just below the Andean chain of northern Peru    i e   Piura and Lambayeque   where sugarcane  lemon  and mango production are still of importance  Important communities are found all over the Morropón Province  such as in the city of Chulucanas  One of them is Yapatera  a community in the same city  as well as smaller farming communities like Pabur or La Matanza and even in the mountainous region near Canchaque  Further south  the colonial city of Zaña or farming towns like Capote and Tuman in Lambayeque are also important regions with Afro Peruvian presence   Socioeconomic and cultural indicators are increasingly important as identifiers  For example  Peruvians of Amerindian descent who have adopted aspects of Hispanic culture also are beginning to consider themselves  mestizo   With economic development  access to education  intermarriage  and large scale migration from rural to urban areas  a more homogeneous national culture is developing  mainly along the relatively more prosperous coast  Peruvians view themselves as a racially mixed people  a  half indigenous  a third European  a sixth African and one part Asiatic  composition as a  melting pot  recipe for a Peruvian stew   Most of Peru s population  about 50% percent  lives in the Costa  coastal area   while 36% live in the Sierra  the Andes  and only 12% in the Selva or Amazon rain forest   Almost one third of the nation s population lives in the Lima and Callao Metropolitan Area   Lima is home to over 8 million Peruvians  one of South America s largest urban areas  it includes the neighboring community of Callao that s grown fast and expanded since the 1960s   5  Language  According to the Peruvian Constitution of 1993  Peru s official languages are Spanish and  Amerindian languages such as Quechua  Aymara and other such indigenous languages in areas where they predominate  Today  Spanish is spoken by some 83 9% Spanish is used by the government and the media and in education and commerce  Amerindians who live in the Andean highlands speak Quechua and Aymara and are ethnically distinct from the diverse indigenous groups who live on the eastern side of the Andes and in the tropical lowlands adjacent to the Amazon basin   Peru s distinct geographical regions are mirrored in a socioeconomic divide between the coast s mestizo Hispanic culture and the more diverse  traditional Andean cultures of the mountains and highlands  The indigenous populations east of the Andes speak various languages and dialects  Some of these groups still adhere to traditional customs  while others have been almost completely assimilated into the mestizo Hispanic culture   Peru s official languages are Spanish and  according to the Peruvian Constitution of 1993  Amerindian languages such as Quechua  Aymara and other such indigenous languages in areas where they predominate  Today  Spanish is spoken by some 83 9% of the population  and is the language used by government  media  and in education and formal commerce  There has been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken   According to official sources  the use of Spanish has increased while the knowledge and use of indigenous languages has decreased considerably during the last four decades  1960舑2000   At the beginning of the 1960s some 39% of the total Peruvian population were registered as speakers of indigenous languages  but by the 1990s the figures show a considerable decline in the use of Quechua  Aymara and other indigenous languages  when only 28% is registered as Quechua speaking  16% of whom are reported to be bilingual in Spanish  and Spanish speakers increased to 72%   For 2005  government figures place Spanish as being spoken by 80 3% of the population  but among Amerindian languages another decrease is registered  Of the indigenous languages  Quechua remains the most spoken  and even today is used by some 16 2% of the total Peruvian population  or a third of Peru s total indigenous population  The number of Aymara speakers and other indigenous languages is placed at 3%  and foreign languages 0 2%   The drastic decline in use and knowledge of indigenous languages is largely attributed to the recent demographic factors  The urbanization and assimilation of Peru s Amerindian plurality into the Hispanic mestizo culture  as well as the new socioeconomic factors associated with class structure have given privilege to the use of Spanish at the expense of the Amerindian languages which were spoken by the majority of the population less than a century ago   The major obstacle to a more widespread use of the Quechua language is the fact that multiple dialects of this language exist  Quechua  along with Aymara and the minor indigenous languages  was originally and remains essentially an oral language  Therefore  there is a lack of modern media which use it  for example books  newspapers  software  magazines  technical journals  etc  However  non governmental organizations as well as state sponsored groups are involved in projects to edit and translate major works into the Quechua language  for instance  in late 2005 a superb version of Don Quixote was presented in Quechua   The percentage of native speakers of Quechua who are illiterate has been decreasing lately  as 86 87% of the Peruvian population is literate  More encouraging  nationwide literacy rate of youth aged 15 to 24 years is high  and considered an achievement in Peruvian educational standards   6  Education  Under the 1993 constitution  primary education is free and compulsory  The system is highly centralized  with the Ministry of Education appointing all public school teachers  Eighty three percent of Peru s students attend public schools at all levels  but over 15 percent  usually the upper classes  attend private schools if their parents can afford to pay for the tuition   School enrollment has been rising sharply for years  due to a widening educational effort by the government and a growing school age population  The illiteracy  2008  rate is estimated at 7 1%  10 6% for women   19 0% in rural areas and 3 7% in urban areas   Quechua is mostly an oral language  so in some cases  in rural areas  people do not speak Spanish and therefore do not know how to read or write  Elementary and secondary school enrollment is about 7 7 million  Peru s 74 universities  1999   39% public and 61% private institutions  enrolled about 322 000 students in 1999   7  See also  Peruvian people  Religion in Peru
