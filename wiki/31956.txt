The United Nations Security Council  UNSC  is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations and is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security  Its powers include the establishment of peacekeeping operations  the establishment of international sanctions  and the authorization of military action through Security Council resolutions  it is the only UN body with the authority to issue binding resolutions to member states  The Security Council held its first session on 17 January 1946   Like the UN as a whole  the Security Council was created following World War II to address the failings of another international organization  the League of Nations  in maintaining world peace  In its early decades  the body was largely paralysed by the Cold War division between the US and USSR and their allies  though it authorized interventions in the Korean War and the Congo Crisis and peacekeeping missions in the Suez Crisis  Cyprus  and West New Guinea  With the collapse of the Soviet Union  UN peacekeeping efforts increased dramatically in scale  and the Security Council authorized major military and peacekeeping missions in Kuwait  Namibia  Cambodia  Bosnia  Rwanda  Somalia  Sudan  and the Democratic Republic of Congo   The Security Council consists of fifteen members  The great powers that were the victors of World War II—Russia  the United Kingdom  France  China  and the United States—serve as the body s five permanent members  These permanent members can veto any substantive Security Council resolution  including those on the admission of new member states or candidates for Secretary General  The Security Council also has 10 non permanent members  elected on a regional basis to serve two year terms  The body s presidency rotates monthly among its members   Security Council resolutions are typically enforced by UN peacekeepers  military forces voluntarily provided by member states and funded independently of the main UN budget  As of 2013  116 837 peacekeeping soldiers and other personnel are deployed on 15 missions around the world  Evaluations of the Security Council s effectiveness are mixed  and calls for its reform predate the body s first meeting  however  little consensus exists on how its structure should be changed   1  History  1 1  Background and creation  In the century prior to the UN s creation  several international treaty organizations and conferences had been formed to regulate conflicts between nations  such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907  Following the catastrophic loss of life in World War I  the Paris Peace Conference established the League of Nations to maintain harmony between the nations  This organization successfully resolved some territorial disputes and created international structures for areas such as postal mail  aviation  and opium control  some of which would later be absorbed into the UN  However  the League lacked representation for colonial peoples  then half the world s population  and significant participation from several major powers  including the US  USSR  Germany  and Japan  it failed to act against the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria  the Second Italo Ethiopian War in 1935  the 1937 Japanese invasion of China  and German expansions under Adolf Hitler that culminated in World War II   The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization was begun under the aegis of the US State Department in 1939  US President Franklin D  Roosevelt first coined the term  United Nations  as a term to describe the Allied countries  The term was first officially used on 1 January 1942  when 26 governments signed the Atlantic Charter   In mid 1944  the Allied powers met for the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington  D C  to negotiate the UN s structure  and the composition of the UN Security Council quickly became the dominant issue  France  the Republic of China  the Soviet Union  the UK  and US were selected as permanent members of the Security Council  the US attempted to add Brazil as a sixth member  but was opposed by the heads of the Russian and British delegations  The most contentious issue at Dumbarton and in successive talks proved to be the veto rights of permanent members  The Soviet delegation argued that each nation should have an absolute veto that could block matters from even being discussed  while the British argued that nations should not be able to veto resolutions on disputes to which they were a party  At the Yalta Conference of February 1945  the American  British  and Russian delegations agreed that each of the  Big Five  could veto any action by the council  but not procedural resolutions  meaning that the permanent members could not prevent debate on a resolution   On 25 April 1945  the UN Conference on International Organization began in San Francisco  attended by 50 governments and a number of non governmental organizations involved in drafting the United Nations Charter  At the conference  H  V  Evatt of the Australian delegation pushed to further restrict the veto power of Security Council permanent members  Due to the fear that rejecting the strong veto would cause the conference s failure  his proposal was defeated twenty votes to ten   The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 upon ratification of the Charter by the five then permanent members of the Security Council and by a majority of the other 46 signatories  On 17 January 1946  the Security Council met for the first time at Church House  Westminster  in London  England   1 2  Cold War  The Security Council was largely paralysed in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and USSR and their allies  and the Council generally was only able to intervene in unrelated conflicts   A notable exception was the 1950 Security Council resolution authorizing a US led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea  passed in the absence of the USSR   In 1956  the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis  however  the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR s simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country s revolution  Cold War divisions also paralysed the Security Council s Military Staff Committee  which had been formed by Articles 45舑47 of the UN Charter to oversee UN forces and create UN military bases  The committee continued to exist on paper but largely abandoned its work in the mid  50s   In 1960  the UN deployed the United Nations Operation in the Congo  UNOC   the largest military force of its early decades  to restore order to the breakaway State of Katanga  restoring it to the control of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by 1964  However  the Security Council found itself bypassed in favour of direct negotiations between the superpowers in some of the decade s larger conflicts  such as the Cuban missile crisis or the Vietnam War  Focusing instead on smaller conflicts without an immediate Cold War connection  the Security Council deployed the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority in West New Guinea in 1962 and the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus in 1964  the latter of which would become one of the UN s longest running peacekeeping missions   On 25 October 1971  over US opposition but with the support of many Third World nations  the mainland  communist People s Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan  the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization  With an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East  Vietnam  and Kashmir  the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange  By the 1970s  the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its budget for peacekeeping   1 3  Post Cold War  After the Cold War  the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties  taking on more missions in ten years  time than it had in its previous four decades  Between 1988 and 2000  the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled  and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold  The UN negotiated an end to the Salvadoran Civil War  launched a successful peacekeeping mission in Namibia  and oversaw democratic elections in post apartheid South Africa and post Khmer Rouge Cambodia  In 1991  the Security Council demonstrated its renewed vigor by condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on the same day of the attack  and later authorizing a US led coalition that successfully repulsed the Iraqis  Undersecretary General Brian Urquhart later described the hopes raised by these successes as a  false renaissance  for the organization  given the more troubled missions that followed   Though the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another  in the early 1990s  the UN faced a number of simultaneous  serious crises within nations such as Somalia  Haiti  Mozambique  and the former Yugoslavia  The UN mission in Somalia was widely viewed as a failure after the US withdrawal following casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu  and the UN mission to Bosnia faced  worldwide ridicule  for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing  In 1994  the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in the Rwandan Genocide in the face of Security Council indecision   In the late 1990s  UN authorised international interventions took a wider variety of forms  The UN mission in the 1991–2002 Sierra Leone Civil War was supplemented by British Royal Marines  and the UN authorised 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was overseen by NATO  In 2003  the US invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization  prompting a new round of questioning of the organization s effectiveness  In the same decade  the Security Council intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the War in Darfur in Sudan and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo  In 2013  an internal review of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered  systemic failure   In November December 2014  Egypt presented a motion proposing an expansion of the NPT  non Proliferation Treaty   to include Israel and Iran  this proposal was due to increasing hostilities and destruction in the Middle East connected to the Syrian Conflict as well as others  All members of the Security Council are signatory to the NPT   disarmament un org treaties t npt  2  Role  The UN s role in international collective security is defined by the UN Charter  which authorizes the Security Council to investigate any situation threatening international peace  recommend procedures for peaceful resolution of a dispute  call upon other member nations to completely or partially interrupt economic relations as well as sea  air  postal  and radio communications  or to sever diplomatic relations  and enforce its decisions militarily  or by any means necessary  The Security Council also recommends the new Secretary General to the General Assembly and recommends new states for admission as member states of the United Nations  The Security Council has traditionally interpreted its mandate as covering only military security  though US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke controversially persuaded the body to pass a resolution on HIV AIDS in Africa in 2000   Under Chapter VI of the Charter   Pacific Settlement of Disputes   the Security Council  may investigate any dispute  or any situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute   The Council may  recommend appropriate procedures or methods of adjustment  if it determines that the situation might endanger international peace and security  These recommendations are generally considered to not be binding  as they lack an enforcement mechanism  A minority of scholars  such as Stephen Zunes  have argued that resolutions made under Chapter VI are  still directives by the Security Council and differ only in that they do not have the same stringent enforcement options  such as the use of military force    Under Chapter VII  the Council has broader power to decide what measures are to be taken in situations involving  threats to the peace  breaches of the peace  or acts of aggression   In such situations  the Council is not limited to recommendations but may take action  including the use of armed force  to maintain or restore international peace and security   This was the legal basis for UN armed action in Korea in 1950 during the Korean War and the use of coalition forces in Iraq and Kuwait in 1991 and Libya in 2011  Decisions taken under Chapter VII  such as economic sanctions  are binding on UN members  the Security Council is the only UN body with the authority to issue binding resolutions   The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court recognizes that the Security Council has authority to refer cases to the Court in which the Court could not otherwise exercise jurisdiction  The Council exercised this power for the first time in March 2005  when it referred to the Court  the situation prevailing in Darfur since 1 July 2002   since Sudan is not a party to the Rome Statute  the Court could not otherwise have exercised jurisdiction  The Security Council made its second such referral in February 2011 when it asked the ICC to investigate the Libyan government s violent response to the Libyan Civil War   Security Council Resolution 1674  adopted on 28 April 2006   reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity   The Security Council reaffirmed this responsibility to protect in Resolution 1706 on 31 August of that year  These resolutions commit the Security Council to take action to protect civilians in an armed conflict  including taking action against genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing  and crimes against humanity   3  Members  3 1  Permanent members  The Security Council s five permanent members  below  have the power to veto any substantive resolution  this allows a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution  but not to prevent or end debate   At the UN s founding in 1946  the five permanent members of the Security Council were the Republic of China  the French Republic  the Soviet Union  the United Kingdom  and the United States  There have been two major seat changes since then  China s seat was originally held by Chiang Kai shek s Nationalist Government  the Republic of China  However  the Nationalists were forced to retreat to the island of Taiwan in 1949  during the Chinese Civil War  The Communist government assumed control of mainland China  henceforth known as the People s Republic of China  In 1971  Resolution 2758 recognized the People s Republic as the rightful representative of China in the UN and gave it the seat on the Security Council that had been held by the Republic of China  which was expelled from the UN altogether with no opportunity of membership as a separate nation  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991  Russia was recognized as the legal successor state of the Soviet Union and maintained the latter s position on the Security Council  Additionally  France reformed its government into the French Fifth Republic in 1958  under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle  France maintained its seat as there was no change in its international status or recognition  although many of its overseas possessions eventually became independent   The five permanent members of the Security Council were the victorious powers in World War II and have maintained the world s most powerful military forces ever since  Until 2012  when Japan surpassed France   they annually topped the list of countries with the highest military expenditures  In 2013  they spent over US$1 trillion combined on defence  accounting for over 55% of global military expenditures  the US alone accounting for over 35%   They are also among the world s largest arms exporters and are the only nations officially recognized as  nuclear weapon states  under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  NPT   though there are other states known or believed to be in possession of nuclear weapons   3 1 1  Veto power  Under Article 27 of the UN Charter  Security Council decisions on all substantive matters require the affirmative votes of nine members  A negative vote or  veto  by a permanent member prevents adoption of a proposal  even if it has received the required votes  Abstention is not regarded as a veto in most cases  though all five permanent members must actively concur to amend the UN Charter or to recommend the admission of a new UN member state  Procedural matters are not subject to a veto  so the veto cannot be used to avoid discussion of an issue  The same holds for certain decisions that directly regard permanent members  A majority of vetoes are used not in critical international security situations  but for purposes such as blocking a candidate for Secretary General or the admission of a member state   As of 2012  269 vetoes had been cast since the Security Council s inception  In this period  China  ROC PRC  used the veto 9 times  France 18  Russia USSR 128  the UK 32  and the US 89  Roughly two thirds of Russian Soviet vetoes were in the first ten years of the Security Council s existence  Between 1996 and 2012  China vetoed 5 resolutions  Russia 7  and the US 13  while France and the UK did not use the veto   An early veto by Soviet Commissar Andrei Vishinsky blocked a resolution on the withdrawal of French forces from the then colonies of Syria and Lebanon in February 1946  this veto established the precedent that permanent members could use the veto on matters outside of immediate concerns of war and peace  The USSR went on to veto matters including the admission of Austria  Cambodia  Ceylon  Finland  Ireland  Italy  Japan  Laos  Libya  Portugal  South Vietnam  and Transjordan as UN member states  delaying their joining by several years  Britain and France used the veto to avoid Security Council condemnation of their actions in the 1956 Suez Crisis  The first veto by the US came in 1970  blocking General Assembly action in Southern Rhodesia  From 1985舑90  the US vetoed 27 resolutions  primarily to block resolutions it perceived as anti Israel but also to protect its interests in Panama and Korea  The USSR  US  and China have all vetoed candidates for Secretary General  with the US using the veto to block the re election of Boutros Boutros Ghali in 1996   3 2  Non permanent members  Along with the five permanent members  the Security Council has temporary members that hold their seats on a rotating basis by geographic region  In its first two decades  the Security Council had six non permanent members  the first of which were Australia  Brazil  Egypt  Mexico  the Netherlands  and Poland  In 1965  the number of non permanent members was expanded to ten   These ten non permanent members are elected by the General Assembly for two year terms starting on 1 January  with five replaced each year  To be approved  a candidate must receive at least two thirds of all votes cast for that seat  which can result in deadlock if there are two roughly evenly matched candidates  In 1979  a standoff between Cuba and Colombia only ended after three months and a record 154 rounds of voting  both eventually withdrew in favour of Mexico as a compromise candidate  A retiring member is not eligible for immediate re election   The African Group is represented by three members  the Latin America and the Caribbean  Asia Pacific  and Western European and Others groups by two apiece  and the Eastern European Group by one  Also  one of the members is an  Arab country   alternately from the Asia Pacific or African Group  Currently  elections for terms beginning in even numbered years select two African members  and one each within Eastern Europe  Asia Pacific  and Latin America and the Caribbean  Terms beginning in odd numbered years consist of two Western European and Other members  and one each from Asia Pacific  Africa  and Latin America and the Caribbean   The current elected members  with the regions they were elected to represent and their Permanent Representatives  are as follows   3 3  President  The role of president of the Security Council involves setting the agenda  presiding at its meetings and overseeing any crisis  The president is authorized to issue both presidential statements  subject to consensus among Council members  and notes  which are used to make declarations of intent that the full Security Council can then pursue  The presidency of the Council is held by each of the members in turn for one month  following the English alphabetical order of the Member States names  The list of nations which will hold the Presidency in 2015 are as follows   3 4  Meeting locations  Unlike the General Assembly  the Security Council meets year round  Each Security Council member must have a representative available at UN Headquarters at all times in case an emergency meeting becomes necessary   The Security Council generally meets in a designated chamber in the United Nations Conference Building in New York City  U S  The chamber was designed by the Norwegian architect Arnstein Arneberg and was a gift from Norway  The mural painted by the Norwegian artist Per Krohg depicts a phoenix rising from its ashes  symbolic of the world s rebirth after World War II   The Security Council has also held meetings in cities including Addis Ababa  Ethiopia  Panama City  Panama  and Geneva  Switzerland  In March 2010  the Security Council moved into a temporary facility in the General Assembly Building as its chamber underwent renovations as part of the UN Capital Master Plan  The renovations were funded by Norway  the chamber s original donor  for a total cost of US$5million  The chamber reopened on 16 April 2013   4  Subsidiary organs bodies  Article 29 of the Charter provides that the Security Council can establish subsidiary bodies in order to perform its functions  This authority is also reflected in Rule 28 of the Provisional Rules of Procedure  The subsidiary bodies established by the Security Council are extremely heterogenous  On the one hand  they include bodies such as the Security Council Committee on Admission of New Members  On the other hand  both the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda were also created as subsidiary bodies of the Security Council  The by now numerous Sanctions Committees  see   established in order to oversee implementation of the various sanctions regimes are also subsidiary bodies of the Council   5  United Nations peacekeepers  After approval by the Security Council  the UN may send peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities  Since the UN does not maintain its own military  peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states  These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed  Blue Helmets  for their distinctive gear  The peacekeeping force as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988   In September 2013  the UN had 116 837 peacekeeping soldiers and other personnel deployed on 15 missions  The largest was the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  MONUSCO   which included 20 688 uniformed personnel  The smallest  United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan  UNMOGIP   included 42 uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir  Peacekeepers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization  UNTSO  have been stationed in the Middle East since 1948  the longest running active peacekeeping mission   UN peacekeepers have also drawn criticism in several postings  Peacekeepers have been accused of child rape  soliciting prostitutes  or sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Haiti  Liberia  Sudan and what is now South Sudan  Burundi and Ivory Coast  Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak  which killed more than 8 000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake   The budget for peacekeeping is assessed separately from the main UN organisational budget  in the 2013–2014 fiscal year  peacekeeping expenditures totalled $7 54 billion  UN peace operations are funded by assessments  using a formula derived from the regular funding scale  but including a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members  This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries  In 2013  the top 10 providers of assessed financial contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations were the US  28 38%   Japan  10 83%   France  7 22%   Germany  7 14%   the United Kingdom  6 68%   China  6 64%   Italy  4 45%   Russian Federation  3 15%   Canada  2 98%   and Spain  2 97%    6  Criticism and evaluations  In examining the first sixty years of the Security Council s existence  British historian Paul Kennedy concludes that  glaring failures had not only accompanied the UN s many achievements  they overshadowed them   identifying the lack of will to prevent ethnic massacres in Bosnia and Rwanda as particular failures  Kennedy attributes the failures to the UN s lack of reliable military resources  writing that  above all  one can conclude that the practice of announcing  through a Security Council resolution  a new peacekeeping mission without ensuring that sufficient armed forces will be available has usually proven to be a recipe for humiliation and disaster    A 2005 RAND Corporation study found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts  It compared UN nation building efforts to those of the United States  and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace  as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace  Also in 2005  the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars  genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War  and presented evidence  albeit circumstantial  that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict since the end of the Cold War   Scholar Sudhir Chella Rajan argued in 2006 that the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  who are all nuclear powers  have created an exclusive nuclear club that predominately addresses the strategic interests and political motives of the permanent members舒for example  protecting the oil rich Kuwaitis in 1991 but poorly protecting resource poor Rwandans in 1994  Since three of the five permanent members are also European  and three or four are predominantly white Western nations  the Security Council has been described as a pillar of global apartheid by Titus Alexander  former Chair of Westminster United Nations Association   The Security Council s effectiveness and relevance is questioned by some because  in most high profile cases  there are essentially no consequences for violating a Security Council resolution  During the Darfur crisis  Janjaweed militias  allowed by elements of the Sudanese government  committed violence against an indigenous population  killing thousands of civilians  In the Srebrenica massacre  Serbian troops committed genocide against Bosniaks  although Srebrenica had been declared a UN safe area  protected by 400 armed Dutch peacekeepers  The UN Charter gives all three powers of the legislative  executive  and judiciary branches to the Security Council   In his inaugural speech at the 16th Summit of the Non Aligned Movement in August 2012  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized the United Nations Security Council as having an  illogical  unjust and completely undemocratic structure and mechanism  and called for a complete reform of the body   The amount of time devoted to the Israeli Arab conflict in the UNSC has been described as excessive by some pro Israel political organizations such as the UN Watch and the Anti Defamation League  and academics such as Alan Dershowitz  Martin Kramer  and Mitchell Bard  This “excessiveness” is partially due to the existence of the Security Council Resolution 1322  2000   that serves the legal basis for a monthly discussion on this protracted conflict  Paragraph 7 “invites the Secretary General to continue to follow the situation and to keep the Council informed ” In accordance with its general practices  it is considered that this issue has to be dealt on a regular basis  i e  every month   The resolution was adopted with 14 affirmative votes and one abstention  At the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly  New Zealand Prime Minister John Key heavily criticized the UN s inaction on Syria  more than two years after the Syrian civil war began   7  Membership reform  Proposals to reform the Security Council began with the conference that wrote the UN Charter and have continued to the present day  As British historian Paul Kennedy writes   Everyone agrees that the present structure is flawed  But consensus on how to fix it remains out of reach    There has been discussion of increasing the number of permanent members  The countries who have made the strongest demands for permanent seats are Brazil  Germany  India  and Japan  Japan and Germany  the main defeated powers in WWII  are now the UN s second  and third largest funders respectively  while Brazil and India are two of the largest contributors of troops to UN mandated peace keeping missions  This proposal has found opposition in a group of countries called Uniting for Consensus   Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan asked a team of advisers to come up with recommendations for reforming the United Nations by the end of 2004  One proposed measure is to increase the number of permanent members by five  which  in most proposals  would include Brazil  Germany  India  Japan  known as the G4 nations   one seat from Africa  most likely between Egypt  Nigeria or South Africa  and or one seat from the Arab League  On 21 September 2004  the G4 nations issued a joint statement mutually backing each other s claim to permanent status  together with two African countries  Currently the proposal has to be accepted by two thirds of the General Assembly  128 votes    The permanent members  each holding the right of veto  announced their positions on Security Council reform reluctantly  The United States has unequivocally supported the permanent membership of Japan and lent its support to India and a small number of additional non permanent members  The United Kingdom and France essentially supported the G4 position  with the expansion of permanent and non permanent members and the accession of Germany  Brazil  India and Japan to permanent member status  as well as an increase in the presence by African countries on the Council  China has supported the stronger representation of developing countries and firmly opposed Japan s membership   India s bid for permanent member of UNSC is backed by all permanent members   bar China   namely France  Russia  the United Kingdom and United States  although the United States initially opposed India s candidacy on grounds of nuclear proliferation  as India has acquired nuclear weapons and not signed the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  On 15 April 2011  China officially expressed its support for an increased Indian role at the United Nations  without explicitly endorsing India s Security Council ambitions  However  recently China has expressed its support for Indian candidacy as a permanent member of the Security Council if India revoked its support for Japanese candidacy  thus making India the only candidate that has received support from all permanent members and most other nations as well   8  See also  Military Staff Committee  a sub organ of the Security Council
