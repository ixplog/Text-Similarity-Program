Tékumel is a fantasy world created by M  A  R  Barker over the course of several decades from around 1940  With time  Barker also created the role playing game Empire of the Petal Throne  set in the Tékumel fictional universe  and first published in 1975 by TSR  Inc  In this imaginary world  huge  tradition bound empires with medieval levels of technology vie for control using magic  large standing armies  and ancient technological devices   1  Sources  Barker s legendarium  like that of the better known J  R  R  Tolkien  considered not just the creation of a fantasy world but also an in depth development of the societies and languages of the world  In other words  the setting also provided a context for Barker s constructed languages which were developed in parallel from the mid to late 1940s  long before the mass market publication of his works in roleplaying game and book form   The most significant language created by Barker for his setting is Tsolyáni  which resembles Urdu  Pushtu and Mayan  Tsolyáni has had grammatical guides  dictionaries  pronunciation recordings  and even a complete language course developed for it  In order for his imaginary languages to have this type of depth  Barker developed entire cultures  histories  dress fashions  architectural styles  weapons  armor  tactical styles  legal codes  demographics and more  inspired by Indian  Middle Eastern  Egyptian and Meso American mythology in contrast to the majority of such fantasy settings  which draw primarily on European mythologies   2  Setting  The world of Tékumel  Nu Ophiuchi d  a k a  Sinistra d   was first settled by humans exploring the galaxy about 60 000 years in the future  along with several other alien species  Their extensive terraforming of the inhospitable environment  including changing the planet s orbit and rotation rate to create a 365 25 day year  disrupted local ecologies and banished most of the local flora and fauna  including some intelligent species  to small reservations in the corners of their own world  resulting in a golden age of technology and prosperity for humankind and its allies  Tékumel became a resort world  where the wealthy from a thousand other stars could while away their time next to its warm seas   Suddenly  and for reasons unknown  Tékumel and its star system  Tékumel s two moons  Gayél and Káshi  its sun  Tuléng  and four other planets  Ülétl  Riruchél  Shíchel  and Zirúna  were cast out of our reality into a  pocket dimension   known as a béthorm in Tsolyáni   in which there were no other star systems  One hypothesis is that this isolation happened through hostile action on the part of an unknown party or group  Another is that the cosmic cataclysm was due to over use of a faster than light drive which warped the fabric of space  No one knows  but the inhabitants of Tékumel  both human  native  and representatives of the other starfaring races  were now isolated and alone   Severed from vital interplanetary trade routes  Tékumel is a world very poor in heavy metals  and in the midst of a massive gravitic upheaval due to the lines of gravitational force between the stars being suddenly cut  civilization was thrown into chaos  The intelligent native species  the Hlüss and the Ssú  broke free from their reservations and wars as destructive as the massive geographic changes ravaged the planet  Several other significant changes took place due to the crisis  mankind discovered it could now tap into ultraplanar energies that were seen as magical forces  the stars were gone from the sky  dimensional nexi were uncovered and pacts with  demons   inhabitants of dimensions near in n dimensional space to Tékumel s pocket dimension  were made and a complex pantheon of  Gods   powerful extra dimensional or multi dimensional alien beings  discovered  Science began to stagnate until ultimately knowledge became grounded in traditions handed down from generations long ago  the belief that the universe was ultimately understandable slowly faded  and a Time of Darkness descended over the planet   Much of Barker s writing concerns a time approximately 50 000 years after Tékumel has entered its pocket dimension  Five vast tradition oriented civilizations occupy a large portion of the northern continent  These five human empires  along with various non human allies who are descended from other star faring races  vie to control resources  including other planar  magical powers  and ancient technology  as they vie for survival and supremacy among themselves as well as hostile and other non human races   Much of the gaming materials and other writings focus particularly on these Five Empires which control much of the world s northern continent  only about an eighth of the planet s surface has published maps    2 1  Languages  Tsolyáni is one of several languages spoken on the world of Tékumel  and was the first conlang published as part of a role playing game  It is inspired by Urdu  Pushtu and Mayan  the latter influence can be seen in the inclusion of the sounds hl and tl    As could be expected  Barker put great effort into the languages of Tékumel  Although Tsolyáni is the only Tekumeláni language that has had a full grammar book  dictionary  pronunciation tapes  on CD  and a primer  publicly released  it is not the only language for this world that Barker developed   Also available are grammar guides for the Yán Koryáni and Livyáni languages which are spoken in two other of the  Five Empires  of the known parts of Tékumel  as well as grammar books for Engsvanyáli and Sunúz  These two languages are now extinct  dead languages  Engsvanyáli is of use as it is the root language for Tsolyáni and many of the other currently spoken languages of the known parts of Tékumel  Sunúz is of interest because  although it is obscure  it is quite useful for sorcerous purposes  For instance  Sunúz contains terms to describe movement in a six dimensional multi planar space  something of use to beings who visit the other planar realms where  demons  live   Barker also published extensively on scripts for other languages of Tékumel   3  Published works  3 1  Board games  Baker designed War of Wizards  a combat oriented board game  based on his world of Tékumel   3 2  Roleplaying  Barker was a Professor of Urdu and South Asian Studies at the University of Minnesota during the period when David Arneson  Gary Gygax and a handful of others were developing the first role playing games in the Twin Cities and Lake Geneva  Wisconsin  Barker tapped into this tradition and the setting he had developed from his childhood fantasies  much as H  G  Wells had done for his Floor Games leading into the better known follow up  Little Wars  to further explore and develop Tékumel  His  Thursday Night Groups  were amongst the first roleplaying sessions anywhere and provided what was  at the time  an unusually detailed week by week development of the setting  In 1975  Tactical Studies Rules  Inc   the publishers of Dungeons & Dragons  published Barker s roleplaying game and setting as a standalone game under the title of The Empire of the Petal Throne  a synonym for the Tsolyáni Empire   rather than as a  supplement  to the original D&D rules   Tékumel has spawned four professionally published roleplaying games over the course of the years   Empire of the Petal Throne  published in 1975 as a boxed set by TSR  Inc  and reprinted later as a single book by Different Worlds Publications in 1987   Swords & Glory  published in 1983 4 in two volumes by Gamescience   Gardasiyal  Adventures in Tekumel  published in 1994 by Theater of the Mind Enterprises   Tékumel  Empire of the Petal Throne  published in 2005 by Guardians of Order  There have been a wide variety of materials of all sorts published over the years to further details this world  As well as the language materials  these include Deeds of the Ever Glorious —a History of the Tsolyani Legions  The Tékumel Bestiary  and The Book of Ebon Bindings  a guide to the demonic beings that are known to the Tsolyáni  and a six volume series of booklets that details the armies of each of the Five Empires as well as surrounding states and the vast lands of the reptilian Shén  There have also been various wargames rules as well as small scale metal miniatures to represent the various races and legions  Miniatures for the world are currently being produced in 28mm scale under license by Eureka miniatures of Australia  As interest in the game is driven to a large extent by a highly devoted  small number of enthusiasts  there have also been several non commercially published rules as well as systems to adapt the Tékumel setting to other pre existing  commercially available role playing rules including RuneQuest  GURPS and third edition Dungeons and Dragons  Many of these are available on the internet   3 3  Novels  In 1984  DAW Books published Barker s Tékumel novel The Man of Gold  This was followed by Flamesong in 1985  In 2003  Zottola Publishing published three additional novels  Prince of Skulls  Lords of Tsámra  and A Death of Kings  In 2004 Zottola Publishing produced the two volume set Mitlanyál  which deals with the Tsolyáni pantheon and provides much background regarding the Tsolyáni culture   The chronological order of the novels  as opposed to their order of publication  is as follows   The Man of Gold  Flamesong  Lords of Tsámra  Prince of Skulls  A Death of Kings  4  References  5  External links   in French  There are several Yahoo  Groups
