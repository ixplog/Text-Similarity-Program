Lemuridae is a family of strepsirrhine primates native to Madagascar  and one of five families commonly known as lemurs  These animals were once thought to be the evolutionary predecessors of monkeys and apes  but this is no longer considered correct   1  Characteristics  Lemurids are medium sized arboreal primates  ranging from 32 to 56 cm in length  excluding the tail  and weighing from 0 7 to 5 kg  They have long  bushy tails and soft  woolly fur of varying coloration  The hindlegs are slightly longer than the forelegs  although not enough to hamper fully quadrupedal movement  unlike the sportive lemurs   Most species are highly agile  and regularly leap several metres between trees  They have a good sense of smell and binocular vision  Unlike most other lemurs  all but one species of lemurid  the Ring tailed Lemur  lack a tapetum lucidum  a reflective layer in the eye that improves night vision   Lemurids are herbivorous  eating fruit  leaves  and  in some cases  nectar  For the most part  they have the dental formula   With most lemurids  the mother gives birth to one or two young after a gestation period of between 120 and 140 days  depending on species  The ruffed lemur species are the only lemurids that have true litters  consisting of anywhere from two to six offspring  They are generally sociable animals  living in groups of up to thirty individuals in some species  In some cases  such as the Ring tailed Lemur  the groups are long lasting  with distinct dominance hierarchies  while in others  such as the Common Brown Lemur  the membership of the groups varies from day to day  and seems to have no clear social structure   2  Classification  The family Lemuridae contains 21 extant species in five genera   FAMILY LEMURIDAE  Genus Lemur  Ring tailed lemur  Lemur catta  Genus Eulemur  true lemurs  Common brown lemur  Eulemur fulvus  Sanford s brown lemur  Eulemur sanfordi  White headed lemur  Eulemur albifrons  Red lemur  Eulemur rufus  Red fronted lemur  Eulemur rufifrons  Collared brown lemur  Eulemur collaris  Gray headed lemur  Eulemur cinereiceps  Black lemur  Eulemur macaco  Sclater s lemur  Eulemur flavifrons  Crowned lemur  Eulemur coronatus  Red bellied lemur  Eulemur rubriventer  Mongoose lemur  Eulemur mongoz  Genus Varecia  ruffed lemurs  Black and white ruffed lemur  Varecia variegata  Red ruffed lemur  Varecia rubra  Genus Hapalemur  bamboo lemurs  Eastern lesser bamboo lemur  a k a  gray gentle bamboo lemur   Hapalemur griseus  Southern lesser bamboo lemur  Hapalemur meridionalis  Western lesser bamboo lemur  Hapalemur occidentalis  Lac Alaotra gentle Lemur  a k a  bandro   Hapalemur alaotrensis  Golden bamboo lemur  Hapalemur aureus  Genus Prolemur  Greater bamboo lemur  Prolemur simus  Genus †Pachylemur  †Pachylemur insignis  †Pachylemur jullyi This family was once broken into two subfamilies  Hapalemurinae  bamboo lemurs and the greater bamboo lemur  and Lemurinae  the rest of the family   but molecular evidence and the similarity of the scent glands have since placed the ring tailed lemur with the bamboo lemurs and the greater bamboo Lemur   Lemur species in the Eulemur genus are known to interbreed  despite having dramatically different chromosome numbers  Red fronted  2N 60  and Collared  2N 50–52  Brown Lemurs were found to hybridize at Berenty Reserve  Madagascar   3  References
