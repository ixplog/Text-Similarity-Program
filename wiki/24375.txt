The Porsche 944 was a luxury sports car built by Porsche from 1982 to 1991  It was built on the same platform as the 924  which remained in production until 1988  The 944 was intended to last into the 1990s  but major revisions planned for a 944  S3  model were eventually rolled into the 968 instead  which replaced the 944  The 944 was a successful model and was available as both a coupé and cabriolet in naturally aspirated and turbocharged forms   1  History and model overview  The Porsche 924 had originally been a project of VW Porsche a joint Porsche Volkswagen company created to develop and produce the 914 which was sold in Europe as both a Porsche and a Volkswagen  In 1972 a replacement for the Volkswagen version of the 914  code named EA 425 began development  The model was to be sold as an Audi as part of the VW Audi Porsche marketing arrangement  Although testing had begun in the Spring of 1974 Volkswagen decided to cancel the program due to the expense of production as well as the feeling that the recently released Volkswagen Scirocco would fill the sports coupe sufficiently  At the time Porsche was considering introducing their own water cooled front engine 2+2 coupe to replace the 912E and their model of 914 and Volkswagen s cancellation provided an opportunity  Porsche purchased the design and the finished development with an Mechanical Fuel Injection system  The vehicle drove and handled exceptionally well and received positive reviews  but was criticized for the Audi sourced 2 litre engine  Later in 1979  Porsche introduced a Turbocharged 924 to increase performance  but the price was considered too high for the time  which hampered sales  Rather than scrap the design  Porsche decided to develop the 924  as they had with generations of the 911  although model numbers would change  the 924 would provide the basis for its replacement   Porsche re worked the platform and abandoned the Audi engine  installing in its place its own freshly designed all alloy 2 5 litre straight 4 engine  bore   stroke   that was  in essence  half of the 928 s 5 0 litre V8  although very few parts were actually interchangeable  Not a natural choice for a luxury sports car  a four cylinder engine was chosen for fuel efficiency and size  because it had to be fitted from below on the Neckarsulm production line  To overcome the unbalanced secondary forces that make other four cylinder engines feel harsh  Porsche included two counter rotating balance shafts running at twice engine speed  Invented in 1904 by British engineer Frederick Lanchester  and further developed and patented in 1975 by Mitsubishi Motors  balance shafts carry eccentric weights which produce inertial forces that balance out the unbalanced secondary forces  making a four cylinder engine feel as smooth as a six cylinder  The engine was factory rated at in its U S  configuration  Revised bodywork with wider wheel arches  similar to that of the 924 Carrera GT  a fresh interior and upgrades to the braking and suspension systems rounded out the major changes  Porsche introduced the 944 for MY 1982 to great anticipation  In addition to being slightly faster  despite having a poorer drag co efficient than the 924   the 944 was better equipped and more refined than the 924  it had better handling and stopping power  and was more comfortable to drive  The factory claimed 0 60 mph time of less than 9 seconds  8 3 seconds according to  Porsche the Ultimate Guide  By Scott Faragher   The factory claimed top speed of was also pessimistic  Autocar having verified a top speed of   The car had nearly even front to rear weight distribution  50 7% front 49 3% rear  thanks to the rear transaxle balancing out the engine in the front  This gave it very balanced  predictable handling at the limits of adhesion   In mid 1985 the 944 underwent its first significant changes  These included   a new dash and door panels  embedded radio antenna  upgraded alternator  from 90 amp to 115 amp   increased oil sump capacity  new front and rear cast alloy control arms and semi trailing arms  larger fuel tank  optional heated and powered seats  Porsche HiFi sound system  and revisions in the mounting of the transaxle to reduce noise and vibration  The  cookie cutter  style wheels used in the early 944s were upgraded to new  phone dial  style wheels   Fuchs wheels remained an option   1985 model year cars incorporating these changes are sometimes referred to as  1985B    85 5  or  1985½  cars   For the 1987 model year  the 944 Motronic DME was updated  and newly incorporated anti lock braking and air bags for increased safety  Because of the ABS system  the wheel offset changed to and Fuchs wheels were no longer an option   In early 1989 before the release of the 944S2  Porsche upgraded the 944 from the 2 5 liter engine to a 2 7 liter engine  bore   stroke   with a rated  versus for the 1988 2 5 liter engine  and a significant increase in torque  In addition to the increase in displacement  the new motor featured a siamesed cylinder block design and a different cylinder head which incorporated larger valves   1 1  944 Turbo  951 952   For the 1985 model year Porsche introduced the 944 Turbo  known internally as the 951  This had a turbocharged and intercooled version of the standard car s engine that produced   in the US  at 6000 rpm  In 1987  Car and Driver tested the 944 Turbo and achieved a 0 60 mph time of 5 9 seconds  The turbo was the world s first car using a ceramic port liner to retain exhaust gas temperature and new forged pistons and was also the first vehicle to produce identical power output with or without a catalytic converter  The Turbo also featured several other changes  such as improved aerodynamics  notably an integrated front bumper  This featured the widest turn signals  indicators  fitted to any production car  a strengthened gearbox with a different final drive ratio  standard external oil coolers for both the engine and transmission  standard 16 inch wheels  optional forged Fuchs wheels   and a slightly stiffer suspension  progressive springs  to handle the extra weight  The Turbo s front and rear brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 911  with Brembo 4 piston fixed calipers and 12  inch discs as ABS also came standard  Major engine component revisions  more than thirty in all  were made to the 951 to compensate for increased internal loads and heat   Changes occurred for the 1987 model year  On the interior  the 1987 944 Turbo became the first production car in the world to be equipped with driver and passenger side air bags as standard equipment  A low oil level light was added to the dash as well as a speedometer as opposed to the speedometer on the 1986 model Turbos  Also included is the deletion of the transmission oil cooler  and a change in suspension control arms in order to reduce the car s scrub radius  The engine remained the same M44 51 power plant as in the 1986 model   In 1988  Porsche introduced the Turbo S  The 944 Turbo S had a more powerful engine  designation number M44 52  with and torque  standard 944 Turbo and    This higher output was achieved by using a larger K26 8 turbine housing and revised engine mapping which allowed maintaining maximum boost until 5800 rpm as compared to the standard 944 Turbo the boost would decrease from at 3000 rpm to at 5800 rpm  In June 1988  Car and Driver tested the 944 Turbo S  with the advantage of shorter final drive gear  and achieved a 0  time of 5 5 seconds and a quarter mile time of 13 9 seconds at   Top speed was factory rated at    The 944 Turbo S s suspension was the then state of the art  M030  option consisting of Koni adjustable shocks front and rear  with ride height adjusting threaded collars on the front struts  progressive rate springs  larger hollow rear anti roll torsion bars  harder durometer suspension bushings throughout  larger hollow anti roll torsion bars at the front  and chassis stiffening brackets in the front frame rails  The air conditioning dryer lines are routed differently so as to clear the front frame brace on the driver s side  The 944 Turbo S wheels  known as the Club Sport design  were 16 inch Fuch forged and flat dished  similar to the Design 90 wheel  Wheel widths were in the front  and in the rear with offset  sizes of the Z rated tires were 225 50 in the front and 245 45 in the rear  The front and rear fender edges were rolled to accommodate the larger wheels  The manual transmission  case code designation  AOR  featured a higher friction clutch disc setup  and an external cooler  and also featured a limited slip differential with a 40% lockup setting  The Turbo S front brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 928 S4  with larger Brembo GT 4 piston fixed calipers and 12  inch discs  rear Brembo brakes remained the same as a standard Turbo  ABS also came standard   The 944 Turbo S interior featured full power seats for both driver and passenger  where the majority of the factory built Turbo S models sported a  Burgundy plaid   Silver Rose edition  but other interior exterior colors were available  A 10 speaker sound system and equalizer + amp was a common option with the Turbo S and S SE prototypes  Only the earlier 1986  prototypes featured a sonderwunchprogram or special wishes custom interior options package   In 1989 and later production  the  S  designation was dropped from the 944 Turbo S  and all 944 Turbos featured the Turbo S enhancements as standard  The 944 Turbo S was the fastest production four cylinder car of its time   1 2  944 S  For the 1987 model year  the 944S  Super  was introduced  The 944S featured a high performance normally aspirated  dual overhead cam 16 valve version of the 2 5 litre engine  M44 40  featuring a self adjusting timing belt tensioner  This marked the first use of four valve per cylinder heads and DOHC in the 944 series  derived from the 928S4 featuring a redesigned camshaft drive  a magnesium intake tract passages  magnesium valve cover  larger capacity oil sump and revised exhaust system  The alternator capacity was 115 amps  The wheel bearings were also strengthened and the brake servo action was made more powerful  Floating 944 calipers were standard  but the rear wheel brake circuit pressure regulator from the 944 turbo was used  Discreet  16 Ventiler  script badges were added on the sides in front of the body protection mouldings  Performance was quoted as 0 – in 6 5 seconds  Best  and a top speed due to a 2857lb weight  It also featured an improved programmed Bosch Digital Motronic 2 Computer DME with dual knock sensors for improved fuel performance for the higher 10 9 1 compression ratio cylinder head  Like the 944 Turbo  the 944S received progressive springs for greater handling  Larger front and rear anti roll bars  revised transmission and gearing to better suit the 2 5 litre DOHC higher 6800 rpm rev limit  Dual safety air bags  limited slip differential and ABS braking system were optional on the 944S   A Club Sport touring package  M637  was available as was the lightweight 16 inch CS Sport Fuch 16x7 and 16x9 forged alloy wheels  This SC version car was raced in Canada  Europe and in the USA IMSA Firehawk Cup Series  Production was limited to only two years  1987 and 1988   It was superseded in 1989 by the  S2  944 edition  The 1987 944S power to weight ratio was such that it was able to accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in 6 5 seconds  its Best Time Performance  thus matching the acceleration of its newer larger displacement 3 0 Liter 944S2 sibling   1 3  944 S2  In 1989 the 944S2 was introduced  powered by a normally aspirated  dual overhead cam 16 valve 3 0L version of the 944S engine  With a bore of and a stroke of   it was the largest production 4 cylinder engine of its time  The 944S2 also received a revised transmission and gearing to better suit the 3 0 liter M44 41 powerplant  The 944S2 had the same rounded nose and a rear valance found on the Turbo model  This was the first example of the use of an integrated front bumper  where the fender and hood profiles would merge smoothly with the bumper  a design feature that has only now seen widespread adoption on the 1990 onward production cars  Performance was quoted as 0 60 mph in 6 0 seconds  0–100 km h 6 8 s   with a top speed of via manual transmission  A Club Sport touring package  M637  was also available  Dual air bags  left hand drive models   limited slip differential and ABS were optional  Series 90 16 inch cast alloy wheels were standard equipment   In 1990 Porsche released the 944 S2 Cabriolet  a first for the 944 line which featured the cabriolet body built by ASC American Sunroof Company at Weinsberg Germany  Porsche produced units for all markets including right hand drive for the United Kingdom  Australia and South Africa   This car was raced around the world and in the British championship called the Porsche Motorsport Championship  Production was limited to three years  1989  1990 and 1991  The 944 S2 power to weight ratio was such that it was able to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 6 5 seconds   1 4  944 Turbo Cabriolet  In February 1991 Porsche released the 944 Turbo Cabriolet  which combined the Turbo S s engine with the cabriolet body built by ASC American Sunroof Company at Weinsberg Germany   Porsche initially announced that 600 would be made  ultimately 625 were built  100 of which were right hand drive for the United Kingdom  Japanese  Australian and South African market  None were imported to the US and The America s   1 5  End of the line  In early 1990  Porsche engineers began working on what they had intended to be the third evolution of the 944  the S3  As they progressed with the development process  they realized that so many parts were being changed that they had produced an almost entirely new vehicle  Porsche consequently shifted development from the 944 S S2 to the car that would replace the 944 entirely  the 968  The 944 s final year of production was 1991 with over 200 000 cars built and were sold  In 1992 the 968 debuted and was sold alongside the 928 through 1995  when both water cooled front engine models were discontinued   2  Awards  The 944 was on Car and Driver s Ten Best list from 1983 through 1985  and the Turbo made the list for 1986   In 1984  Car and Driver named the 944 the Best Handling Production Car in America   3  Production  In total 163 192 cars in the 944 family were produced between 1982 and 1991  This high number made it the most successful car line in Porsche s history until the respective introductions of the Boxster and 997 Carrera   3 1  944  A total of 113 070 944s were made between 1982 and 1989  with 56
