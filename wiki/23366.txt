The economy of Pakistan is the 26th largest in the world in terms of purchasing power parity  PPP   and 44th largest in terms of nominal GDP even though the country is sixth most populous in the world  As Pakistan has a population of over 186 million  the world s 6th largest   thus GDP per capita is $3 149 ranking 140th in the world  Pakistan is a developing country and is one of the Next Eleven  the eleven countries that  along with the BRICs  have a potential to become one of the world s large economies in the 21st century  However  after decades of war and social instability  as of 2013  serious deficiencies in basic services such as railway transportation and electric power generation had developed  The economy is semi industrialized  with centres of growth along the Indus River  Primary export commodities include textiles  leather goods  sports goods  chemicals and carpets and Rugs   Growth poles of Pakistan s economy are situated along the Indus River  the diversified economies of Karachi and major urban centers in the Punjab  coexisting with lesser developed areas in other parts of the country  The economy has suffered in the past from internal political disputes  a fast growing population  mixed levels of foreign investment  Foreign exchange reserves are bolstered by steady worker remittances  but a growing current account deficit – driven by a widening trade gap as import growth outstrips export expansion – could draw down reserves and dampen GDP growth in the medium term  Pakistan is currently undergoing process economic liberalization with includes privatization of all government corporations  aimed to attract foreign investment and decrease budget deficit  In 2014  foreign currency reserves crossed $15 billion which has led to stable outlook on the long term rating by Standard & Poor s   1  Economic history  1 1  First five decades  Pakistan was a very poor and predominantly agricultural country when it gained independence in 1947  Pakistan s average economic growth rate in the first five decades  1947 1997  has been higher than the growth rate of the world economy during the same period  Average annual real GDP growth rates were 6 8% in the 1960s  4 8% in the 1970s  and 6 5% in the 1980s  Average annual growth fell to 4 6% in the 1990s with significantly lower growth in the second half of that decade  See also  With a GDP growth rate of 6 8% during the 1960s  Pakistan was seen as a model of economic development around the world  and there was much praise for its economic progress  Karachi was seen as an economic role model around the world  and there was much praise for the way its economy was progressing  Many countries sought to emulate Pakistan s economic planning strategy and one of them  South Korea  copied the city s second  Five Year Plan   Later  economic mismanagement in general  and fiscally imprudent economic policies in particular  caused a large increase in the country s public debt and led to slower growth in the 1970s and 1990s  The economy improved during the 1980s  with a GDP growth of 6 5%  a policy of economic deregulation  and an increased inflow of remittances from expatriate workers   1 2  Recent decades  This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Pakistan at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Pakistani Rupees  See also  1 3  Economic resilience  1 3 1  Background  Historically  Pakistan s overall economic output  GDP  has grown every year since a 1951 recession  Despite this record of sustained growth  Pakistan s economy had  until a few years ago  been characterised as unstable and highly vulnerable to external and internal shocks  However  the economy proved to be unexpectedly resilient in the face of multiple adverse events concentrated into a four year  1998–2002  period —  the Asian financial crisis   economic sanctions – according to Colin Powell  Pakistan was  sanctioned to the eyeballs    The global recession of 2001–2002   a severe drought – the worst in Pakistan s history  lasting about four years   heightened perceptions of risk as a result of military tensions with India – with as many as 1 million troops on the border  and predictions of impending  potentially nuclear  war   the post 9 11 military action in neighbouring Afghanistan  with a massive influx of refugees from that country  Despite these adverse events  Pakistan s economy kept growing  and economic growth accelerated towards the end of this period  This resilience has led to a change in perceptions of the economy  with leading international institutions such as the IMF  World Bank  and the ADB praising Pakistan s performance in the face of adversity   1 4  Macroeconomic reform and prospects  According to many sources  the Pakistani government has made substantial economic reforms since 2000  and medium term prospects for job creation and poverty reduction are the best in nearly a decade   Government revenues have greatly improved in recent years  as a result of economic growth  tax reforms – with a broadening of the tax base  and more efficient tax collection as a result of self assessment schemes and corruption controls in the Central Board of Revenue – and the privatisation of public utilities and telecommunications  Pakistan is aggressively cutting tariffs and assisting exports by improving ports  roads  electricity supplies and irrigation projects  Islamabad has doubled development spending from about 2% of GDP in the 1990s to 4% in 2003  a necessary step towards reversing the broad underdevelopment of its social sector   Liberalisation in the international textile trade has already yielded benefits for Pakistan s exports  and the country also expects to profit from free trade in agriculture  As a large country  Pakistan hopes to take advantage of significant economies of scale  and to replace China as the largest textile manufacturer as the latter China moves up the value added chain  These industries play to Pakistan s relative strengths in low labour costs   Growing stability in the nation s monetary policies has contributed to a reduction in money market interest rates  and a great expansion in the quantity of credit  changing consumption and investment patterns in the nation  Pakistan s domestic natural gas production  and its significant use of CNG in automobiles  has cushioned the effect of the oil price shock of 2004–2005  Pakistan is also moving away from the doctrine of import substitution which some developing countries  such as Iran  dogmatically pursued in the twentieth century  The Pakistani government is now pursuing an export driven model of economic growth successfully implemented by South East Asia and now highly successful in China   In 2005  the World Bank reported that  1 4 1  Doing Business  The World Bank  WB  and International Finance Corporation s flagship report Ease of Doing Business Index 2010 ranked Pakistan 85 among 181 countries around the globe  Pakistan came highest in South Asia and also was ranked higher than China and Russia which were at 133  The top five countries were Singapore  New Zealand  the United States  Hong Kong and United Kingdom   The Government of Pakistan has granted numerous incentives to technology companies wishing to do business in Pakistan  A combination of decade plus tax holidays  zero duties on computer imports  government incentives for venture capital and a variety of programmes for subsidising technical education  are intended there   2  The economy today  Due to inflation and economic crisis worldwide  Pakistan s economy reached a state of Balance of Payment crisis   The International Monetary Fund bailed out Pakistan in November 2008 to avert a balance of payments crisis and in July last year increased the loan to $11 3 billion from an initial $7 6 billion    During the mid 2000s  Pakistan experienced a period of tremendous growth  averaging 7% yearly GDP growth between 2003–07  Due to its large population of 186 million  it was included in 2005 by the as one of the  Next Eleven  N 11   – a group of countries with economies that “might have the kind of potential for global impact that the BRICs projections highlighted  essentially an ability to match the G7 in size”   By October 2007  Pakistan raised back its Foreign Reserves to a handsome $16 4 billion  Exceptional policies kept Pakistan s trade deficit controlled at $13 billion  exports boomed to $18 billion  revenue generation increased to become $13 billion and attracted foreign investment of $8 4 billion   Since the beginning of 2008  Pakistan s economic outlook has stagnated  Security concerns stemming from the nation s role in the War on Terror have created great instability and led to a decline in Foreign Direct Investment from a height of approximately $8 bn to $3 5bn for the current fiscal year  Concurrently  the insurgency has forced massive capital flight from Pakistan to the Gulf  Combined with high global commodity prices  the dual impact has shocked Pakistan s economy  with gaping trade deficits  high inflation and a crash in the value of the Rupee  which has fallen from 60–1 USD to over 80 1 USD in a few months  For the first time in years  it may have to seek external funding as Balance of Payments support  Consequently  S&P lowered Pakistan’s foreign currency debt rating to CCC plus from B  just several notches above a level that would indicate default  Pakistan’s local currency debt rating was lowered to B minus from BB minus  Credit agency Moody’s Investors Service cut its outlook on Pakistan’s debt to negative from stable due to political uncertainty  though it maintained the country’s rating at B2  The cost of protection against a default in Pakistan’s sovereign debt trades at 1 800 basis points  according to its five year credit default swap  a level that indicates investors believe the country is already in or will soon be in default   The middle term however may be less turbulent  depending on the political environment  The EIU estimates that inflation should drop back to single digits in 2010  and that growth should pick up to over 5% per annum by 2011  Although less than the previous 5 year average of 7%  it would represent an overcoming of the present crisis wherein growth is a mere 3 5 4%   Economic comparison of Pakistan 1999–2008  2 1  Stock market  In the first four years of the twenty first century  Pakistan s KSE 100 Index was the best performing stock market index in the world as declared by the international magazine “Business Week”  The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Pakistan was valued at $5 937 million in 2005 by the World Bank  But in 2008  after the General Elections  uncertain political environment  rising militancy along western borders of the country  and mounting inflation and current account deficits resulted in the steep decline of the Karachi Stock Exchange  As a result  the corporate sector of Pakistan has declined dramatically in recent times  However the market bounced back strongly in 2009 and the trend continues in 2011  By 2014 the stock market burst into unchartered territories as the benchmark KSE 100 Index rose 907 points  3 1%  and shot past the 30 000 point barrier to close at a new record high  this came days after Moody’s announced that it was upgrading the outlook of 5 major Pakistani banks from Negative to Stable  resulting in heavy buying in the banking sector  The rally was supported by heavy buying in the oil and gas and cement sectors  An article published in The Journal of Developing Areas of Tennessee State University in USA  economist Mete Feridun investigates the exchange rate movements in the Pakistani foreign exchange market using the market micro structure approach  shedding more lights on the dynamics of the Pakistani Stock Exchange   2 2  Manufacturing and finance  Pakistan s manufacturing sector has experienced double digit growth in recent years  from 2000 to 2007  with large scale manufacturing growing from a minimal 1 5% in 1999 to a record 19 9% in 2004–05 and averaged 8 8% by end of 2007   The Federal Bureau of Statistics valued the finance and insurance sector at Rs 311 741 million in 2005 thus registering over 166% growth since 2000  A reduction in the fiscal deficit had resulted in less government borrowing in the domestic money market  lower interest rates  and an expansion in private sector lending to businesses and consumers   2 3  Middle class  As of 2013  according to Macro Economic Insights  a research firm in Islamabad  the size of the Pakistani middle class is conservatively estimated at approximately 70 million  out of a total population of about 186 million  This represents 40% of the population of the country   On measures of income inequality  the country ranks slightly better than the median  In late 2006  the Central Board of Revenue estimated that there were almost 2 8 million income tax payers in the country  However by 2013  the number of taxpayers was drastically reduced to just 768 000 out of a total population of 190 million  meaning that only 0 57% of the population pay taxes  Poverty levels have decreased by 10% since 2001 Foreign Companies which provide for Pakistani middle classes have been very successful  For example  demand for Unilever products have recently been so high that even after doubling production the Anglo Dutch company struggled to meet demand and its chairman stated  Pakistanis can’t seem to have enough    2 4  Poverty alleviation expenditures  Pakistan government spent over 1 trillion Rupees  about $16 7 billion  on poverty alleviation programmes during the past four years  cutting poverty from 35% in 2000–01 to 24% in 2006  Rural poverty remains a pressing issue  as development there has been far slower than in the major urban areas   2 5  Demographics  With a per capita GDP of $2600  PPP  2005  in 2005 the World Bank considers Pakistan a low income country  it is also recorded as a  Low Development Country  on the Human Development Index 2007  Pakistan has a large informal economy  which the government is trying to document and assess  Approximately 56% of adults are literate  and life expectancy is about 64 years  The population  about 168 million in 2007  is growing at about 1 80%   Relatively few resources in the past had been devoted to socio economic development or infrastructure projects  Inadequate provision of social services  high birth rates and immigration from nearby countries in the past have contributed to a persistence of poverty  An influential recent study concluded that the fertility rate peaked in the 1980s  and has since fallen sharply  Pakistan has a family income Gini index of 41  close to the world average of 39   2 5 1  Employment  The high population growth in the past few decades has ensured that a very large number of young people are now entering the labor market  Even though it is among the six most populous Asian nations  Pakistan has a lower population density than Bangladesh  Japan  India  and the Philippines  In the past  excessive red tape made firing from jobs  and consequently hiring  difficult  Significant progress in taxation and business reforms has ensured that many firms now are not compelled to operate in the underground economy   In late 2006  the government launched an ambitious nationwide service employment scheme aimed at disbursing almost $2 billion over five years   Mean wages were $0 98 per manhour in 2009  Rate of unemployment is 25%   High inflation and limited wage growth have drawn more women into the workforce to feed their families  in spite of cultural resistance and domestic abuse over the issue   2 6  Tourism  Tourism in Pakistan has been stated as being the tourism industry s  next big thing   Pakistan  with its diverse cultures  people and landscapes has attracted 75 million tourists to the country  almost double to that of a decade ago  Due to threat of terrorism the number of foreigner tourist has gradually declined and shock of 2013 Nanga Parbat tourist shooting has terribly effected  Moreover  presence of extremists  suspected terrorists  at Alpine Club of Pakistan has created an other hurdle to attract the western tourists   Pakistan s tourism industry was in its heyday during the 1970s when the country received unprecedented amounts of foreign tourists  thanks to the Hippie trail  The main destinations of choice for these tourists were the Khyber Pass  Peshawar  Karachi  Lahore  Swat  Quetta  Gwadar and Rawalpindi   The tourism industry is still growing  The country s attraction range from the ruin of civilisation such as Mohenjo daro  Harappa and Taxila  to the Himalayan hill stations  which attract those interested in winter sports  Pakistan is home to several mountain peaks over 7000 m  which attracts adventurers and mountaineers from around the world  especially K2  The north part of Pakistan has many old fortresses  ancient architecture and the Hunza and Chitral valley  home to small pre Islamic Animist Kalasha community claiming descent from Alexander the Great  The romance of the historic Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is timeless and legendary  Punjab province has the site of Alexander s battle on the Jhelum River and the historic city of Lahore  Pakistan s cultural capital  with many examples of Mughal architecture such as Badshahi Masjid  Shalimar Gardens  Tomb of Jahangir and the Lahore Fort  Before the Global economic crisis  Pakistan received more than 500 000 tourists annually  Karachi  Peshawar and Lahore are major attractions for authentic Pakistani food and culture   2 7  Revenue  Although the country is a Federation with constitutional division of taxation powers between the Federal Government and the four provinces  the revenue department of the Federal Government  the Federal board of Revenue  collects almost 95% of the entire national revenue  The Federal Board of Revenue collected nearly one trillion rupees  $14 1 billion  in taxes in the 2007–2008 financial year  while it collected about 1558 billion  $18 3 billion  during FY 2010–2011  The revenue collection has hovered below 10% of the GDP for the past several years  The Federal Board of Revenue mainly relies on indirect taxation  and most of the Income Tax is also collected indirectly  in the form of withholding taxes   3  Currency system  3 1  Rupee  The basic unit of currency is the Rupee  ISO code PKR and abbreviated Rs  which is divided into 100 paisas  Currently the newly printed 10 000 rupee note is the largest denomination in circulation  Recently the SBP has introduced all new design notes of Rs  10  20  50  100  500  1000 and 5000  The new notes have been designed using the euro technology and are made in eye catching bright colours and bold  stylish designs   The Pakistani Rupee was pegged to the Pound sterling until 1982  when the government of General Zia ul Haq  changed it to managed float  As a result  the rupee devalued by 38 5% between 1982 83 many of the industries built by his predecessor suffered with a huge surge in import costs  After years of appreciation under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and despite huge increases in foreign aid the Rupee depreciated   3 2  Foreign exchange rate  The Pakistani rupee depreciated against the US dollar until around the start of the 21st century  when Pakistan s large current account surplus pushed the value of the rupee up versus the dollar  Pakistan s central bank then stabilised by lowering interest rates and buying dollars  in order to preserve the country s export competitiveness  3 3  Foreign exchange reserves  Pakistan maintains foreign reserves with State Bank of Pakistan  The currency of the reserves was solely US dollar incurring speculated losses after the Dollar prices fell during 2005  forcing the then Governor SBP Ishrat Hussain to step down  In the same year the SBP issued an official statement proclaiming diversification of reserves in currencies including Euro and Yen  withholding ratio of diversification   In October 2007  at the end of Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz’s tenure  Pakistan raised back its Foreign Reserves to $16 4 billion  Pakistan s trade deficit was at $13 billion  exports grew to $18 billion  revenue generation increased to become $13 billion and the country attracted foreign investment of $8 4 billion   However  following the internaltional credit crisis and spikes in crude oil prices Pakistan s economy could not withstand the pressure and on October 11  2008 State Bank of Pakistan reported that country s foreign exchange reserves had gone down by $571 9 million to $7749 7 million  The foreign exchange reserves had declined more by $10 billion to an alarming level of $6 59 billion   In July 2011  the State Bank of Pakistan reported reserves to hit an all time high of $18 25 billion  As of May 2014 the reserves have increased to over $12 billion   4  Structure of economy  The economy of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is suffering with high inflation rates well above 26%  Over 1 081 patent applications were filed by non resident Pakistanis in 2004 revealing a new found confidence  Agriculture accounted for about 53% of GDP in 1947  While per capita agricultural output has grown since then  it has been outpaced by the growth of the non agricultural sectors  and the share of agriculture has dropped to roughly one fifth of Pakistan s economy  In recent years  the country has seen rapid growth in industries  such as apparel  textiles  and cement  and services  such as telecommunications  transportation  advertising  and finance    5  Major Sectors  5 1  Primary  5 1 1  Agriculture  The most important crops are wheat  sugarcane  cotton  and rice  which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output  Pakistan s largest food crop is wheat  In 2005  Pakistan produced 21 591 400 metric tons of wheat  more than all of Africa  20 304 585 metric tons  and nearly as much as all of South America  24 557 784 metric tons   according to the FAO  The country is expected to harvest 25 to 23 million tons of wheat in 2012  Pakistan has also cut the use of dangerous pesticides dramatically   Pakistan is a net food exporter  except in occasional years when its harvest is adversely affected by droughts  Pakistan exports rice  cotton  fish  fruits  especially Oranges and Mangoes   and vegetables and imports vegetable oil  wheat  pulses and consumer foods  The country is Asia s largest camel market  second largest apricot and ghee market and third largest cotton  onion and milk market  The economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence  when its share of GDP was around 53%  Following the poor harvest of 1993  the government introduced agriculture assistance policies  including increased support prices for many agricultural commodities and expanded availability of agricultural credit  From 1993 to 1997  real growth in the agricultural sector averaged 5 7% but has since declined to about 4%  Agricultural reforms  including increased wheat and oilseed production  play a central role in the government s economic reform package   Majority of the population  directly or indirectly  dependent on this sector  It contributes about 24 percent of Gross Domestic Product  GDP  and accounts for half of employed labor force and is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings   Pakistan s Top Ten commodities by export value in 2011 were   Pakistan s principal natural resources are arable land and water  About 25% of Pakistan s total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world  Pakistan irrigates three times more acres than Russia  Pakistan agriculture also benefits from year round warmth  Agriculture accounts for about 23% of GDP and employs about 44% of the labour force  Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited is the largest financial institution geared towards the development of agriculture sector through provision of financial services and technical expertise   Pakistan is one of the world s largest producers of the following commodities according to FAOSTAT  the statistical arm of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of The United Nations  given here with the 2008 ranking   5 1 2  Mining  Pakistan is endowed with significant mineral resources and is emerging as a very promising area for prospecting exploration for mineral deposits  Based on available information  the country s more than 6 00 000 km² of outcrops area demonstrates varied geological potential for metallic and non metallic mineral deposits  Except oil  gas and nuclear minerals regulated at federal level  minerals are a provincial subject  under the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan  Provincial governments are responsible for development and exploitation of minerals  besides  enforcing regulatory regime  In line with the constitutional framework the federal and provincial governments have jointly set out Pakistan s first National Mineral Policy in 1995  duly implemented by the provinces  providing appropriate institutional and regulatory framework and equitable and internationally competitive fiscal regime   In the recent past  exploration by government agencies as well as by multinational mining companies presents ample evidence of the occurrences of sizeable minerals deposits  Recent discoveries of a thick oxidised zone underlain by sulphide zones in the shield area of the Punjab province  covered by thick alluvial cover have opened new vistas for metallic minerals exploration  Pakistan has a large base for industrial minerals  The discovery of coal deposits having over 175 billion tones of reserves at Thar in the Sindh province has given an impetus to develop it as an alternate source of energy  There is vast potential for precious and dimension stones   The enforcement of Mineral Policy  1995  has paved the way to expand mining sector activities and attract international investment in this sector  International mining companies have responded favorably to the NMP and presently at least four are engaged in mineral projects development   Currently about 52 minerals are under exploitation although on small scale  The major production is of coal  rock salt and other industrial and construction minerals  The current contribution of the mineral sector to the GDP is about 0 5% and likely to increase considerably on the development and commercial exploitation of Saindak & Reco Diq copper and gold deposits  world s largest gold mine   Duddar zinc lead  Thar coal and gemstone deposits   5 2  Secondary  5 2 1  Industry  Pakistan s industrial sector accounts for about 24% of GDP  Cotton textile production and apparel manufacturing are Pakistan s largest industries  accounting for about 66% of the merchandise exports and almost 40% of the employed labour force  Other major industries include cement  fertiliser  edible oil  sugar  steel  tobacco  chemicals  machinery  and food processing   The government is privatizing large scale industrial units  and the public sector accounts for a shrinking proportion of industrial output  while growth in overall industrial output  including the private sector  has accelerated  Government policies aim to diversify the country s industrial base and bolster export industries  Large Scale Manufacturing is the fastest growing sector in Pakistani economy Major Industries include textiles  fertiliser  cement  oil refineries  dairy products  food processing  beverages  construction materials  clothing  paper products and shrimp  In Pakistan SMEs have a significant contribution in the total GDP of Pakistan  according to SMEDA and Economic survey reports  the share in the annual GDP is 40% likewise SMEs generating significant employment opportunities for skilled workers and entrepreneurs  Small and medium scale firms represent nearly 90% of all the enterprises in Pakistan and employ 80% of the non agricultural labor force  These figures indicate the potential and further growth in this sector   Pakistan s largest corporation are mostly involved in utilities like oil  gas and telecommunication   5 2 2  Automotive industry  Pakistan is an emerging market for automobiles and automotive parts offers immense business and investment opportunities  The total contribution of Auto industry to GDP in 2007 is 2 8% which is likely to increase up to 5 6% in the next 5 years  Auto sector presently  contributes 16% to the manufacturing sector which also is expected to increase 25% in the next 7 years  Car ownership in Pakistan has risen by 40% per annum since 2001   5 2 3  Construction material  In 1947  Pakistan had inherited four cement plants with a total capacity of 0 5 million tons  Some expansion took place in 1956–66 but could not keep pace with the economic development and the country had to resort to imports of cement in 1976–77 and continued to do so till 1994–95  The cement sector consisting of 27 plants is contributing above Rs 30 billion to the national exchequer in the form of taxes  However by 2013  Pakistan s cement is fast growing mainly because of demand from Afghanistan and countries boosting real estate sector  In 2013 Pakistan exported 7 708 557 metric tons of cement  Pakistan has installed capitcty of 44 768 250 metric tons of cement and 42 636 428 metric tons of clinker  In the 2012–2013 cement industry in Pakistan became the most profitable sector of economy   5 2 4  Information Communication Technology Industry  Information Communication Technology  ICT  industry grossed over $2 8 billion in 2013  however it is expected to exceed the $10 billion mark by 2018  A marked increase in software export figures are an indication of this booming industry’s potential  The total number of IT companies increased to 1306 and the total estimated size of IT industry is $2 8 billion  In 2007  Pakistan was for the first time featured in the Global Services Location Index by A T  Kearney and was rated as the 30th best location for offshoring  By 2009  Pakistan had improved its rank by ten places to reach 20th  According to Pakistan Startup report  there are about 1 million freelancers working from Pakistan mainly via elance  oDesk and freelancer – world’s famous online market places that count Pakistan among top 5 freelancing nations   5 2 5  Textiles  The Textile Industry is dominated by Punjab  3% of United States imports regarding clothing and other form of textiles is covered by Pakistan  Textile exports in 1999 were $5 2 billion and rose to become $10 5 billion by 2007  Textile exports managed to increase at a very decent growth of 16% in 2006  In the period July 2007 – June 2008  textile exports were US$10 62 billion  Textile exports share in total export of Pakistan has declined from 67% in 1997 to 55% in 2008  as exports of other textile sectors grew  The major reason of decline of textile export of Pakistan is the Govt unhealthy policies  Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd  »  SNGPL  notified the textile mills to reduce the supply of gas for five months  Head of All Pakistan Textile Mills Association of Enterprises Anis ul Haq has expressed concern about the decision  “Now is the time to the textile industry out of a three year downturn  The demand for textile products is growing  and if we are not able to fulfill our current orders  we will lose international buyers  “Monthly loss the textile industry because of interruptions in gas supply could reach about U S  $ 1 billion  or 4 – $ 5 billion for the fiscal year ending June 20 next year The expression  industrial undertaking  has been used in many a provision in the Income tax Act  e g   section 10 15  iv   f  and section 80 I  There has been some controversy as regards the true import of the expression  industrial undertaking  for the purpose of section 10 15   iv  f  of the Income tax Act relating to exemption from income tax in respect of interest on certain foreign borrowings  Keeping in view the legislative intent  an Explanation has been inserted at the end of section 10 15   iv  of the Income tax Act to define the term  industrial undertaking  for the purpose of this provision  An industrial undertaking will mean an undertaking engaged in the business of   manufacture or processing of goods  or  generation or distribution of electricity  or any other form of power  or  mining  or  construction of ships  or  operation of ships or aircraft   5 2 6  Other  As of 2010  Pakistan is one of the largest users of CNG  compressed natural gas  in the world  Presently  more than 3 000 CNG stations are operating in the country in 99 cities and towns  and 1000 more would be set up in the next two years  It has provided employment to over 50 000 people in Pakistan  but the CNG industry is struggling to survive the 2013 energy crisis   5 3  Services  Pakistan s service sector accounts for about 53 3% of GDP  Transport  storage  communications  finance  and insurance account for 24% of this sector  and wholesale and retail trade about 30%  Pakistan is trying to promote the information industry and other modern service industries through incentives such as long term tax holidays   The government is acutely conscious of the immense job growth opportunities in service sector and has launched aggressive privatisation of telecommunications  utilities and banking despite union unrest   5 3 1  Communication  After the deregulation of the telecommunication industry  the sector has seen an exponential growth  Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd has emerged as a successful Forbes 2000 conglomerate with over US $1 billion in sales in 2005  The mobile telephone market has exploded fourteen fold since 2000 to reach a subscriber base of 91 million users in 2008  one of the highest mobile teledensities in the entire world  In addition  there are over 6 million landlines in the country with 100% fibre optic network and coverage via WLL in even the remotest areas  As a result  Pakistan won the prestigious Government Leadership award of GSM Association in 2006   The contribution of the telecom sector to the national exchequer increased to Rs 110 billion in the year end 2007–08 on account of the general sales tax  activation charges and other steps as compared to Rs 100 billion in the year end 2006–07   The World Bank estimates that it takes about 3 days to get a phone connection in Pakistan   In Pakistan  the following are the top mobile phone operators   Mobilink  Parent  Orascom Telecom Holding  Egypt   Ufone  Parent  PTCL  Etisalat   Pakistan UAE   Telenor  Parent  Telenor  Norway   Warid

period in 2008  In addition to the 3 1 million fixed lines  while as many as 2 4 million are using Wireless Local Loop connections  Sony Ericsson  Nokia and Motorola along with Samsung and LG remain the most popular brands among customers   Pakistan is on the verge of a telecom revolution and is by far the most attractive sector in Pakistan in terms of Foreign Direct Investment coming into the country  Since liberalisation  over the past four years  the Pakistani telecom sector has attracted more than $9 billion in foreign investments  During 2007–08  the Pakistani communication sector alone received $1 62 billion in Foreign Direct Investment  FDI  – about 30% of the country’s total foreign direct investment   Present growth of state of the art infrastructures in the telecoms sector during the last four years has been the result of the PTA s vision and implementation of the deregulation policy  Paging and mobile  cellular  telephones were adopted early and freely  Cellular phones and the Internet were adopted through a rather laissez faire policy with a proliferation of private service providers that led to the fast adoption  With a rapid increase in the number of Internet users and ISPs  and a large English speaking population  Pakistani society has seen an unparalleled revolution in communications   According to the   a total of 6 37 billion text messages were sent through Acision messaging systems across Asia Pacific over the 2008 2009 Christmas and New Year period  Pakistan was amongst the top five ranker with one of the highest SMS traffic with 763 million messages   Pakistan is ranked 4th in terms of broadband Internet growth in the world  as the subscriber base of broadband Internet has been increasing rapidly  The rankings are released by Point Topic Global broadband analysis  a global research centre   Pakistan has more than 20 million Internet users in 2009  The country is said to have a potential to absorb up to 50 million mobile phone Internet users in the next 5 years thus a potential of nearly 1 million connections per month   Almost all of the main government departments  organisations and institutions have their own websites   The use of search engines and instant messaging services is also booming  Pakistanis are some of the most ardent chatters on the Internet  communicating with users all over the world  Recent years have seen a huge increase in the use of online marriage services  for example  leading to a major re alignment of the tradition of arranged marriages   As of 2007 there were six cell phone companies operating in the country with nearly 90 million mobile phone users in the country   Wireless local loop and the landline telephony sector has also been liberalised and private sector has entered thus increasing the teledensity rate  In mid 2008  the Local Loop installed capacity reached around 5 5 million   Telecom industry created of 80 000 jobs directly and 500 000 jobs indirectly  The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued this sector at Rs 982 353 million in 2005 thus registering over 91% growth since 2000   5 3 2  Transportation  Pakistan International Airlines  the flagship airline of Pakistan s civil aviation industry  has turnover exceeding $1 billion in 2005  The government announced a new shipping policy in 2006 permitting banks and financial institutions to mortgage ships  Private sector airlines in Pakistan include Airblue  which serves the main cities within Pakistan in addition to destinations in the Gulf and Manchester in the United Kingdom  The other private carrier is Shaheen Air International whose network covers the main cities of Pakistan and the Gulf   A massive rehabilitation plan worth $1 billion over five years for Pakistan Railways has been announced by the government in 2005  A new rail link trial has been established from Islamabad to Istanbul  via the Iranian cities of Zahedan  Kerman and Tehran  It is expected to promote trade  tourism  especially for exports destined for Europe  as Turkey is part of Europe and Asia    5 3 3  Finance  Pakistan s banking sector has remained remarkably strong and resilient during the world financial crisis in 2008–09  a feature which has served to attract a substantial amount of FDI in the sector  Stress tests conducted on June 2008 data indicate that the large banks are relatively robust  with the medium and small sized banks positioning themselves in niche markets  Banking sector turned profitable in 2002  Their profits continued to rise for the next five years and peaked to Rs 84 1  $1 1 billion  billion in 2006   The credit card market continued its strong growth with sales crossing the 1 million mark in mid 2005  Since 2000 Pakistani banks have begun aggressive marketing of consumer finance to the emerging middle class  allowing for a consumption boom  more than a 7 month waiting list for certain car models  as well as a construction bonanza   The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued this sector at Rs 311 741 million in 2005 thus registering over 166% growth since 2000   An article published in Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich in London with his Pakistani colleague Abdul Jalil presents strong econometric evidence that financial development fosters economic growth in Pakistan   5 3 4  Housing  The property sector has expanded twenty threefold since 2001  particularly in metropolises like Lahore  Nevertheless  the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimated in late 2006 that the overall production of housing units in Pakistan has to be increased to 0 5 million units annually to address 6 1 million backlog of housing in Pakistan for meeting the housing shortfall in next 20 years  The report noted that the present housing stock is also rapidly aging and an estimate suggests that more than 50% of stock is over 50 years old  It is also estimated that 50% of the urban population now lives in slums and squatter settlements  The report said that meeting the backlog in housing  besides replacement of out lived housing units  is beyond the financial resources of the government  This necessitates putting in place a framework to facilitate financing in the formal private sector and mobilise non government resources for a market based housing finance system   The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued this sector at Rs 185 376 million in 2005 thus registering over 49% growth since 2000   5 3 5  Minor Sectors  The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued this sector at Rs 389 545 million in 2005 thus registering over 65% growth since 2000  The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued this sector at Rs 631 229 million in 2005 thus registering over 78% growth since 2000  The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued this sector at Rs 1 358 309 million in 2005 thus registering over 96% growth since 2000  The wholesale and retail trade is the largest sub sector of the services  Its share in the overall services sector is estimated at 31 5 percent  The wholesale and retail trade sector is based on the margins taken by traders on the transaction of commodities traded  In 2012  13  this sector grew at 2 5 percent as compared to 1 7 percent in the last year   5 3 6  Energy  For years  the matter of balancing Pakistan s supply against the demand for electricity has remained a largely unresolved matter  Pakistan faces a significant challenge in revamping its network responsible for the supply of electricity  While the government claims credit for overseeing a turnaround in the economy through a comprehensive recovery  it has just failed to oversee a similar improvement in the quality of the network for electricity supply  Most cities in Pakistan receive substantial sunlight throughout the year  which would suggest good conditions for investment in solar energy  If the rich people in Pakistan are shifted to solar energy that they should be forced to purchase solar panels  the shortfall can be controlled  this will make the economy boost again as before 2007 According to an econometric analysis published in Quality & Quantity by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich and his colleague Muhammad Shahbaz economic growth in Pakistan leads to electricity consumption but not vice versa   Similar to other developing countries Pakistan can not plan or control its high population growth  No politician or government official highlights Pakistan s wasted opportunities in education and human development because population increase of 3 07 children born woman and higher in earlier years greatly reduces government ability to finance major new expansion and maintenance of electricity grid and free education and health of Pakistanis   5 3 7  Chemicals and pharmaceuticals  6  Foreign trade  remittances  aid  and investment  6 1  Investment  Foreign direct investment  FDI  in Pakistan soared by 180 6 percent year on year to US$2 22 billion and portfolio investment by 276 per cent to $407 4 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2006  the State Bank of Pakistan  SBP  reported on 24 April  During July–March 2005–06  FDI year on year increased to $2 224 billion from only $792 6 million and portfolio investment to $407 4 million  whereas it was $108 1 million in the corresponding period last year  according to the latest statistics released by the State Bank  Pakistan has achieved FDI of almost $8 4 billion in the financial year 06 07  surpassing the government target of $4 billion  Foreign investment had significantly declined by 2010  dropping by 54 6% due to Pakistan s political instability and weak law and order  according to the Bank of Pakistan   Business regulations have been overhauled along liberal lines  especially since 1999  Most barriers to the flow of capital and international direct investment have been removed  Foreign investors do not face any restrictions on the inflow of capital  and investment of up to 100% of equity participation is allowed in most sectors  Unlimited remittance of profits  dividends  service fees or capital is now the rule  Business regulations are now among the most liberal in the region  This was confirmed by the World Bank s Ease of Doing Business Index report published in September 2009 ranking Pakistan  at 85th  well ahead of neighbours like China  at 89th  and India  at 133rd    Pakistan is attracting private equity and was the ranked as number 20 in the world based on the amount of private equity entering the nation  Pakistan has been able to attract a portion of the global private equity investments because of economic reforms initiated in 2003 that have provided foreign investors with greater assurances for the stability of the nation and their ability to repatriate invested funds in the future   Tariffs have been reduced to an average rate of 16%  with a maximum of 25%  except for the car industry   The privatization process  which started in the early 1990s  has gained momentum  with most of the banking system privately owned  and the oil sector targeted to be the next big privatization operation   The recent improvements in the economy and the business environment have been recognised by international rating agencies such as Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s  country risk upgrade at the end of 2003   47 1% increase in Net FDI in 2014 2015  July October  as compared to 2013 14  July October    6 1 1  Foreign acquisitions and mergers  With the rapid growth in Pakistan s economy  foreign investors are taking a keen interest in the corporate sector of Pakistan  In recent years  majority stakes in many corporations have been acquired by multinational groups   PICIC by Singapore based Temasek Holdings for $339 million  Union Bank by Standard Chartered Bank for $487 million  Prime Commercial Bank by ABN Amro for $228 million  PakTel by China Mobile for $460 million  PTCL by Etisalat for $1 8 billion  Additional 57 6% shares of Lakson Tobacco Company acquired by Philip Morris International for $382 million The foreign exchange receipts from these sales are also helping cover the current account deficit   6 2  Foreign trade  Pakistan s hard currency reserves have grown rapidly  Improved fiscal management  greater transparency and other governance reforms have led to upgrades in Pakistan s credit rating  Together with lower global interest rates  these factors have enabled Pakistan to prepay  refinance and reschedule its debts to its advantage  Despite the country s current account surplus and increased exports in recent years  Pakistan still has a large merchandise trade deficit  The budget deficit in fiscal year 1996–97 was 6 4% of GDP  The budget deficit in fiscal year 2003–04 is expected to be around 4% of GDP   In the late 1990s Pakistan received about $2 5 billion per year in loan grant assistance from international financial institutions  e g   the IMF  the World Bank  and the Asian Development Bank  and bilateral donors  Increasingly  the composition of assistance to Pakistan shifted away from grants toward loans repayable in foreign exchange  All new U S  economic assistance to Pakistan was suspended after October 1990  and additional sanctions were imposed after Pakistan s May 1998 nuclear weapons tests  The sanctions were lifted by president George W  Bush after Pakistani president Musharraf allied Pakistan with the U S  in its war on terror  Having improved its finances  the government refused further IMF assistance  and consequently the IMF programme was ended  The government is also reducing tariff barriers with bilateral and multilateral agreements   While the country has a current account surplus and both imports and exports have grown rapidly in recent years  it still has a large merchandise trade deficit  This deficit amounted to over 15 billion in 2010  The budget deficit in fiscal year 2004–2005 was 3 4% of GDP  The budget deficit in fiscal year 2005–06 is expected to be over 4% of GDP  Economists believe that the soaring trade deficit would have an adverse impact on Pakistani rupee by depreciating its value against dollar  1 US $   60 Rupees  March 2006    and other currencies   One of the main reasons that contributed to the increase in trade deficit is the increased imports of earthquake relief related items  especially tents  tarpaulin and plastic sheets to provide temporary shelter to the survivors of earthquake of October 8  2005 in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  an official said  The rise in the trade gap was also fuelled by high oil import prices  food items  machinery and automobiles   The Petroleum Ministry says that this year the bill of oil imports was expected to reach $6 5 billion against $4 6 billion in the last fiscal year  which is the main reason behind the all time high trade deficit   The EU is the single largest trading partner of Pakistan absorbing over one third of the exports in 2003  In 2010  the EU accounted for 12 4% of Pakistani imports and 22 6% of its exports   The public debt of the country has surged by almost 100% to Rs12 024 trillion as of 31 March 2011 – 2012 from Rs6 055 trillion in 2007 2008  The trade deficit has increased by 14 5% and current account deficit has swelled by $3 39 billion despite the fact that the country received $10 8 billion in workers’ remittances in 10 months of the current financial   6 2 1  Exports  Pakistan s exports increased more than 100% from $7 5 billion in 1999 to stand at $18 billion in the financial year 2007–2008   Pakistan exports rice  oranges  mangoes  furniture  cotton fiber  cement  tiles  marble  textiles  clothing  leather goods  sports goods  renowned for footballs soccer balls   cutlery  surgical instruments  electrical appliances  software  carpets and rugs  ice cream  livestock meat  chicken  powdered milk  wheat  seafood  especially shrimp prawns   vegetables  processed food items  Pakistani assembled Suzukis  to Afghanistan and other countries   defence equipment  submarines  tanks  radars   salt  onyx  engineering goods  and many other items  Pakistan produces and exports cements to Asia and the Middle East  In August 2007  Pakistan started exporting cement to India to fill in the shortage there caused by the building boom  Russia is a growing market for Pakistani exporters  In 2009 2010 the export target of Pakistan was US $20 billion  As of April 2011  Pakistans exports stand at US $25 billion   6 3  External imbalances  Pakistan suffered a merchandise trade deficit of $13 528 billion for the financial year 2006 7  The gap has considerably widened since 2002 3 when the deficit was only $1 06 billion  Services sector deficit for 2006–2007 stood at $4 125 billion which equals the services export of $4 125 billion for the same year   The combined deficit in services and goods stand at $17 653 billion which is approx 83 5% of country s total export of $21 136  Goods and services   The rise in the trade gap has been attributed to high oil import bill  and rise in the prices of food items  machinery and automobiles   Current account – Current account deficit for 2006 7 reached $7 016 billion up by 41% over previous year s $4 490 billion   Since the beginning of 2008  Pakistan s economic outlook has taken a dramatic downturn  Security concerns stemming from the nation s role in the War on Terror have created great instability and led to a decline in FDI from a height of approximately $8 bn to $3 5bn for the current fiscal year  Concurrently  the insurgency has forced massive capital flight from Pakistan to the Gulf  Combined with high global commodity prices  the dual impact has shocked Pakistan s economy  with gaping trade deficits  high inflation and a crash in the value of the Rupee  which has fallen from 60–1 USD to over 80 1 USD in a few months  For the first time in years  it may have to seek external funding as Balance of Payments support  Consequently  S&P lowered Pakistan’s foreign currency debt rating to CCC plus from B  just several notches above a level that would indicate default  Pakistan’s local currency debt rating was lowered to B minus from BB minus  Credit agency Moody’s Investors Service cut its outlook on Pakistan’s debt to negative from stable due to political uncertainty  though it maintained the country’s rating at B2  The cost of protection against a default in Pakistan’s sovereign debt trades at 1 800 basis points  according to its five year credit default swap  a level that indicates investors believe the country is already in or will soon be in default   The middle term however may be less turbulent  depending on the political environment  The EIU hsd estimated that inflation should drop back to single digits in 2010  and that growth would pick up to over 5% per annum by 2011  However  the unprecedented floods of 2010 which encapsulated 20% of Pakistan s land area  have caused a monetary damage estimated to be in excess of $10bn  as a result of which real growth is almost flat and EIU s original targets will have to be revised  Much like previous natural disasters which have afflicted Pakistan  the floods of 2010 inflicted damage of epic proportions  However  the philanthropic nature of Pakistani people and widespread coverage by a fiercely independent and established media has proven yet again that Pakistan is an incredibly resilient nation   6 4  Economic aid  Pakistan receives economic aid from several sources as loans and grants  The International Monetary Fund  IMF   World Bank  WB   Asian Development Bank  ADB   etc  provides long term loans to Pakistan  Pakistan also receives bilateral aid from developed and oil rich countries   The Asian Development Bank will provide close to $6 billion development assistance to Pakistan during 2006–9  The World Bank unveiled a lending programme of up to $6 5 billion for Pakistan under a new four year  2006–2009  aid strategy showing a significant increase in funding aimed largely at beefing up the country s infrastructure  Japan will provide $500 million annual economic aid to Pakistan  In November 2008  the International Monetary Fund  IMF  has approved a loan of 7 6 Billion to Pakistan  to help stabilise and rebuild the country s economy   More recently the government of Pakistan received an economic aid of US $5bn dollars out of which the US pledge of $1bn was described as a down payment on the previously announced $1 5bn already promised to Pakistan for each of the next five years  The European Union promised $640m over four years  while reports said Saudi Arabia had pledged $700m over two years  Overall Friends of Pakistan had pledged $1 6 billion in aid  which would help Pakistan move forward on its way to self reliance   6 5  Remittances  The remittances of Pakistanis living abroad has played important role in Pakistan s economy and foreign exchange reserves  The Pakistanis settled in Western Europe and North America are important sources of remittances to Pakistan  Since 1973 the Pakistani workers in the oil rich Arab states have been sources of billions dollars of remittances   The 7 million strong Pakistani diaspora  contributed US$11 2 billion to the economy in FY2011  The major source countries of remittances to Pakistan include UAE  USA  Saudi Arabia  GCC countries  including Bahrain  Kuwait  Qatar and Oman   Australia  Canada  Japan  UK and EU countries like Norway  Switzerland  etc     The State Bank of Pakistan  SBP  has announced that remittances sent home by overseas Pakistani workers have crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time in the country’s history as the figure reached $10 1 billion in 11 months  July–May  of the current financial year  The 11 month figure was $2 07 billion or 25 per cent more than $8 09 billion worth of remittances received in the same period of the previous year  In May  overseas workers remitted over $1 billion  which was the third consecutive month that remittances crossed this mark  The country received $1 05 billion  $1 03 billion and $1 05 billion in March  April and May respectively  Citing reasons for the sharp increase in remittances  analysts say that a crackdown on the illegal Hundi and Hawala money transfer systems  swift processing and transfer of money by the banking channel and incentives for overseas Pakistanis have encouraged them to utilise legal channels  The flow of charity money after last summer floods has also given a boost to the remittances this year  they say  In the July–May period  remittances from Saudi Arabia  UAE  USA  GCC countries  including Bahrain  Kuwait  Qatar and Oman   UK and EU countries were $2 38 billion  $2 33 billion  $1 86 billion  $1 18 billion  $1 09 billion and $320 93 million respectively  In comparison  remittances stood at $1 72 billion  $1 84 billion  $1 61 billion  $1 13 billion  $793 91 million and $229 74 million respectively in July–May 2009–10  Remittances received from Norway  Switzerland  Australia  Canada  Japan and other countries during the 11 months amounted to $926 86 million against $740 96 million in the same period last year  Governor  State Bank of Pakistan  SBP  Yaseen Anwar said during first ten months of FY2011 12  remittances from overseas Pakistanis rose by 20 2% to $10 88 billion  which helped Balance of Payments  BoP  despite widening of trade deficit  Pakistan’s fiscal challenges are well known and documented  The Pakistani diaspora of around 10 million sent home around $7 9 billion in the first six months of FY2014 and remittances are expected to touch around $16 billion at the end of FY 2014 thus help easing balance of payment crisis  This spillover to the rest of economy is equally clear  He explained that at start of year  July 2011   external conditions appeared daunting due to rising oil prices and lack of external financing   7  Government finances  Fiscal budget summary  Fiscal year  1 July – 30 June  Budget outlay  Rs 3 259 trillion  FY2010 11   Revenues  $19 8 billion  Expenditures   Debt – external  $50 billion  2010 est    Economic aid – recipient  $1 2 billion  FY2010 11   7 1  Revenues and taxation  Pakistan has a low tax GDP ratio  which it is trying to improve  The current tax to GDP ration is estimated to be between 8%–9% which is far below developing other countries of the region such as India  15%  and Sri Lanka  18%   Recently  Pakistan s coalition government proposed the idea of imposing a Reformed General Sales tax which was modelled along the lines of VAT  However  with the war on terror having engulfed Pakistan s economy  the politically unpopular bill was not approved in the senate parliament and has afforded some respite to the people of Pakistan who are already suffering from a stagnant economy and rampant inflation   7 2  Expenditures  and the economic costs of War on Terror   Government expenditures were $25 billion  2006 est    Pakistan has sustained immense socio economic costs of being a partner in the international counter terrorism campaign  According to government estimates  the war on terror cost the Pakistani economy nearly US$8 billion a year in terms of lost exports  foreign investment  privatisation  industrial output  tax collection  see table below for the government s estimation of the cost of ‘War on Terror’ to Pakistan as published in an IMF report     *On account of loss of exports  foreign investment  privatisation  industrial output  tax collection  etc   According to the IMF  the anti terrorist campaign following the 9 11 attacks in the United States strained Pakistan’s budget  as allocations for law enforcement agencies had to be increased significantly  eroding resources for development in the country  In addition to human sufferings and resettlement costs  development projects are afflicted with delays which ultimately resulted in large cost over runs  The heightened sense of uncertainty has contributed to capital flight and slowed down domestic economic activity  creating unease among foreign investors  There has also been massive unemployment in the terror inflicted regions  as frequent bombings and worsening law and order situation have taken a toll on the socio economic fabric of the country   7 3  Sovereign bonds  Pakistan is expected to sell a dual tranche sovereign bond worth $750 million on 23 March 2006 that analysts said should ensure a favourable reception in the bond market  The 10 year tranche would be $500 million and the 30 year portion $250 million  Pricing is expected during New York trading hours on 23 March 2006  The sources said that the 10 year tranche was expected to be priced at around 100125%  while the longer dated tranche was expected to be sold at around 70 875%  the top end of the indicative yield range of 3 75 to 10 875%   The bonds  consisting of 10 year and 30 year tranches  had generated $1 5 billion in orders and a total size of as much as $1 25 billion had been anticipated for what is Pakistan’s third foray into the international debt market since 2004   The Government of Pakistan has been raising money from the international debt market from time to time   The details of amount raised in various issues are as follows   1999 – $6230 million  2004 – $5000 million @ 6 75%  2005 – $6000 million worth Islamic bonds  2007 – $7500 million @ 6 875% worth Euro Bonds which were highly
