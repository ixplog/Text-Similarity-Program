Old Norse is a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during the Viking Age  until about 1300   The Proto Norse language developed into Old Norse by the 8th century  and Old Norse began to develop into the modern North Germanic languages in the mid  to late 14th century  ending the language phase known as Old Norse  These dates  however  are not absolute  since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century   Old Norse was divided into three dialects  Old East Norse  Old West Norse  and Old Gutnish  Old West and East Norse formed a dialect continuum  with no clear geographical boundary between them  For example  Old East Norse traits were found in eastern Norway  although Old Norwegian is classified as Old West Norse  and Old West Norse traits were found in western Sweden  Most speakers spoke Old East Norse in what is present day Denmark and Sweden  Old Gutnish  the more obscure dialectal branch  is sometimes included in the Old East Norse dialect due to geographical associations  It developed its own unique features and shared in changes to both other branches   The 12th century Icelandic Gray Goose Laws state that Swedes  Norwegians  Icelanders and Danes spoke the same language  dǫnsk tunga   Danish tongue   speakers of Old East Norse would have said dansk tunga   Another commonly used term with reference to West Norse  was norrœnt mál   Nordic speech    Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages  Icelandic  Faroese  Norwegian  Danish and Swedish   which retain considerable mutual intelligibility   In some instances the term Old Norse refers specifically to Old West Norse   1  Geographical distribution  Old Icelandic was basically identical to Old Norwegian  and together they formed the Old West Norse dialect of Old Norse  which was also spoken in settlements in Ireland  Scotland  the Isle of Man and north west England  and Norwegian settlements in Normandy  The Old East Norse dialect was spoken in Denmark  Sweden  settlements in Russia  eastern England  and Danish settlements in Normandy  The Old Gutnish dialect was spoken in Gotland and in various settlements in the East  In the 11th century  Old Norse was the most widely spoken European language  ranging from Vinland in the West to the Volga in the East  In Russia  it survived the longest in Novgorod  probably lasting into the 13th century there  The age of the Swedish language s presence in Finland is strongly contested  see Swedish speaking Finns   but at latest by the time of the Second Swedish Crusade in the 13th century  Swedish settlement spread the language into the region   2  Modern descendants  The modern descendants of the Old West Norse dialect are the West Scandinavian languages of Icelandic  Faroese  Norwegian and the extinct Norn language of the Orkney and the Shetland Islands  the descendants of the Old East Norse dialect are the East Scandinavian languages of Danish and Swedish  Norwegian is descended from Old West Norse  but over the centuries it has been heavily influenced by East Norse  particularly during the Denmark–Norway union   Among these  Icelandic and the closely related Faroese have changed the least from Old Norse in the last thousand years  although with Danish rule of the Faroe Islands  Faroese has also been influenced by Danish  Old Norse also had an influence on English dialects and Lowland Scots  which contain many Old Norse loanwords  It also influenced the development of the Norman language  and through it and to a smaller extent  that of modern French   Various other languages  which are not closely related  have been heavily influenced by Norse  particularly the Norman dialects  Scottish Gaelic and Waterford Irish  Russian  Belarusian  Lithuanian  Finnish  Latvian and Estonian also have a number of Norse loanwords  the words Rus and Russia  according to one theory  may be named after the Rus  people  a Norse tribe  see Rus  name   probably from present day east central Sweden  The current Finnish and Estonian words for Sweden are Ruotsi and Rootsi  respectively   Of the modern languages  Icelandic is the closest to Old Norse  Written modern Icelandic derives from the Old Norse phonemic writing system  Contemporary Icelandic speakers can read Old Norse  which varies slightly in spelling as well as semantics and word order  However  pronunciation  particularly of the vowel phonemes  has changed at least as much as in the other North Germanic languages   Faroese retains many similarities but is influenced by Danish  Norwegian  and Gaelic  Scottish and or Irish   Although Swedish  Danish and the Norwegian languages have diverged the most  they still retain asymmetric mutual intelligibility  Speakers of modern Swedish  Norwegian and Danish can mostly understand each other without studying their neighboring languages  particularly if speaking slowly  The languages are also sufficiently similar in writing that they can mostly be understood across borders  This could be because these languages have been mutually affected by each other  as well as having a similar development influenced by Middle Low German   3  Phonology  3 1  Vowels  The vowel phonemes mostly come in pairs of long and short  The standardized orthography marks the long vowels with an acute accent  In medieval manuscripts  it is often unmarked but sometimes marked with an accent or through gemination  All phonemes have  more or less  the expected phonetic realization   Old Norse had nasalized versions of all nine vowel places  These occurred as allophones of the vowels before nasal consonants and in places where a nasal had followed it in an older form of the word  before it was absorbed into a neighboring sound  If the nasal was absorbed by a stressed vowel  it would also lengthen the vowel  These nasalizations also occurred in the other Germanic languages  but were not retained long  They were noted in the First Grammatical Treatise  and otherwise might have remained unknown  The First Grammarian marked these with a dot above the letter  This notation did not catch on  and would soon be obsolete  Nasal and oral vowels probably merged around the 11th century in most of Old East Norse  3 However  the distinction still holds in Dalecarlian dialects  4 The dots in the following vowel table separate the oral from nasal phonemes   Note  The low low mid vowels may be indicated differently           Sometime around the 13th century  Ǫ    merged with Ø or O in all dialects except Old Danish  In Icelandic  all Ǫ merged with Ø  This can be determined by their distinction within the 12th century First Grammatical Treatise but not within the early 13th century Prose Edda  The nasals  also noted in the First Grammatical Treatise  are assumed to have been lost by this time  See Old Icelandic for the Œ   Æ and Ę   E mergers   3 2  Consonants  Old Norse has six plosive phonemes  Of these is rare word initially and and are realized as voiced fricative allophones between vowels  except in compound words  e g  veðrabati   already in the Proto Germanic language  e g  *b    v  between vowels   The phoneme is realized as after an n or another g and as before and   It is realized as a voiced velar fricative   by some accounts inside words  and by others between vowels  and otherwise as    The Old East Norse  ʀ  was an apical consonant whose position isn t precisely known  being reconstructed as a palatal sibilant 2  It descended from Proto Germanic and eventually developed into   as it already had done in Old West Norse   The consonant digraphs hl  hr  hn occurred word initially  It is unclear whether they were sequences of two consonants  with the first element realised as or perhaps    or as single voiceless sonorants   and respectively  In Old Norwegian  Old Danish and later Old Swedish the groups hl  hr  hn were reduced to plain l  r  n  suggesting that they were most likely realised as voiceless sonorants by Old Norse times   The pronunciation of hv is unclear  and may have been  the Proto Germanic pronunciation   or   Unlike the other three groups above  it was retained much longer in all dialects  and never developed into a voiceless sonorant in Icelandic  but instead  hardened  to a plosive   This suggests that it was not a voiceless sonorant  but retained stronger frication   3 3  Orthography  Unlike Proto Norse  which was written with the Elder Futhark  runic Old Norse was originally written with the Younger Futhark  which only had 16 letters  Because of the limited number of runes  the rune for the vowel u was also used for the vowels o  ø and y  and the rune for i was used for e  Medieval runes came into use some time later   As for the Latin alphabet  there was no standardized orthography in use in the Middle Ages  A modified version of the letter wynn called vend was used briefly for the sounds     and   Long vowels were sometimes marked with acutes  but also sometimes left unmarked or geminated  The standardized Old Norse spelling was created in the 19th century  and is for the most part phonemic  The most notable deviation is that the non phonemic difference between the voiced and the voiceless dental fricative is marked — the oldest texts as well as runic inscriptions use þ exclusively  Long vowels are denoted with acutes  Most other letters are written with the same glyph as the IPA phoneme  except as shown in the table below   3 4  Accent  Primary stress in Old Norse falls on the word stem  so that hyrjar would be pronounced   In compound words  secondary stress falls on the second stem  e g  lærisveinn     1  Modern Swedish  Danish  and Norwegian have two registers reflected in differing pronunciation of the stressed syllable of words  In Swedish and Norwegian  the registers are reflected in different tones  i e  through tonal word accent   while in Danish the difference is the presence or absence of stød  a glottal gesture considered a kind of creaky voice that seems to have been documented by Swedish sources as early as the 16th century  What is here called class 1 is reflected as tone 1 in Norwegian  acute accent in Swedish  and presence of stød in Danish  whereas class 2 words have tone 2 in Norwegian  grave accent in Swedish  and no stød in Danish  No sign of any tonal system is found in Icelandic or Faroese   Not all cognates occur in the same register classes in all three languages  partly due to language specific restrictions on the contexts in which the two classes can occur  For example  stød can only occur in stressed words that have long vowels and end in a voiced consonant  whereas in Swedish and Norwegian  monosyllables can only take tone 1 acute accent  In general  however  class 1 words are those that are monosyllabic in Old Norse  while class 2 words are those that are polysyllabic  Exceptions  including minimal pairs  have arisen for various reasons   Suffixing a definite article onto class 1 words does not change their class  suggesting that the register distinctions developed before the definite article fused with the noun  Hence Old Norse and inn  the duck    Swedish class 1 anden  but andi nn  the spirit    class 2 anden   The Old Norse non syllabic morpheme  r after a consonant later became syllabic through the epenthesis of a vowel  without changing the class  Hence Old Norse bœndr  farmers    Norwegian class 1 bønder  but baunir  beans  and bœnir  prayers  both   Norwegian class 2 bønner  homophonous with bønder except for the pitch difference    Many later polysyllabic loanwords in the various languages have acquired class 1   4  Phonological processes  4 1  Ablaut  Ablaut patterns are groups of vowels which are swapped  or ablauted  in the nucleus of a word  Strong verbs ablaut the lemma s nucleus to derive the past forms of the verb  This parallels English conjugation  where  e g   the nucleus of sing becomes sang in the past tense and sung in the past participle  Some verbs are derived by ablaut  as the present in past verbs do by consequence of being derived from the past tense forms of strong verbs   4 2  Umlaut  Umlaut or mutation is an assimilatory process acting on vowels preceding a vowel or semivowel of a different vowel backness  In the case of i umlaut and ʀ umlaut  this entails a fronting of back vowels  with retention of lip rounding  In the case of u umlaut  this entails labialization of unrounded vowels  Umlaut is phonemic and in many situations grammatically significant as a side effect of losing the Proto Germanic morphological suffixes whose vowels created the umlaut allophones   Some               and were obtained by i umlaut from               and respectively  Others were formed via ʀ umlaut from         and    Some         and all   were obtained by u umlaut from         and   respectively  See Old Icelandic for information on    was obtained through a simultaneous u  and i umlaut of   It appears in words like gøra  gjǫra  geyra   from Proto Germanic *garwijaną  and commonly in verbs with a velar consonant before the suffix like søkkva   *sankwijaną   OEN often preserves the original value of the vowel directly preceding runic ʀ while OWN receives ʀ umlaut  Compare runic OEN glaʀ  haʀi  hrauʀ with OWN gler  heri  later héri   hrøyrr hreyrr   glass    hare    pile of rocks     4 2 1  U umlaut  U umlaut is more common in Old West Norse in both phonemic and allophonic positions  while it only occurs sparsely in post runic Old East Norse and even in runic Old East Norse  Compare West Old Norse fǫður  accusative of faðir  father   vǫrðr  guardian caretaker   ǫrn  eagle   jǫrð  in Modern Icelandic  jörð  earth   mjǫlk  in Modern Icelandic  mjólk  with Old Swedish faþur  varþer  örn  jorþ and Modern Swedish örn  jord  mjölk with the latter two demonstrating the u umlaut found in Swedish   This is still a major difference between Swedish and Faroese and Icelandic today  Plurals of neuters do not have u umlaut at all in Swedish  in Danish they do in barn  cf  Swedish barn   but in Faroese and Icelandic they do  for example the Faroese and Icelandic plurals of the word land  lond and lönd in contrast to the Swedish plural land and other numerous examples  That also applies to almost all feminine nouns  for example the largest feminine noun group  the o stem nouns  except the Swedish noun jord mentioned above   and even i stem nouns and rootnomina  such as Old West Norse mǫrk   in Icelandic  in comparison with Modern and Old Swedish mark   4 3  Breaking  Vowel breaking  or fracture  caused a front vowel to be split into a semivowel vowel sequence before a back vowel in the following syllable  While West Norse only broke e  East Norse also broke i  The change was blocked by a v  l  or r preceding the potentially broken vowel  1  Some or and or result from breaking of and respectively   4 4  Assimilation or elision of inflectional ʀ  When a noun  pronoun  adjective  or verb has a long vowel or diphthong in the accented syllable and its stem ends in a single  l   n  or  s  the  r  or the elder r  or z variant ʀ  in an ending is assimilated  When the accented vowel is short  the ending is dropped   The nominative of the strong masculine declension and some i stem feminine nouns uses one such  r  ʀ   Óðin r  Óðin ʀ  becomes Óðinn instead of *Óðinr  *Óðinʀ   but karl r  karl ʀ  remains karl   Blása  to blow  has blæss for  you blow  instead of *blæsr  *blæsʀ    The rule is not hard and fast  with counter examples such as vinr  which has the synonym vin  yet retains the unabsorbed version  and jǫtunn  where assimilation takes place even though the root vowel  Ǫ  is short   Words with a final r in the word stem  such as vetr  do not add another  r  as the sounds are already the same  The effect of the dropping usually results in the lack of distinction between some forms of the noun  In the case of vetr the dropping renders the nominative and accusative singular and plural identical  the nominative singular and nominative and accusative plural would otherwise have been *vetrr  *vintrʀ   while the accusative singular would still have been vetr  This is because the 3rd strong masculine declension  to which it belongs  marks the nominative singular and nominative and accusative plural  but not the accusative singular  with inflectional Rs   5  Phonotactics  5 1  Blocking of ii  uu  I j adjacent to i  e  their u umlauts  and æ was not possible  nor u v adjacent to u  o  their i umlauts  and ǫ  At the beginning of words  this manifested as a dropping of the initial i j or u v  Compare ON orð  úlfr with English word  wolf  In inflections  this manifested as the dropping of the inflectional vowels  Thus  klæði + ᴅᴀᴛ  i remains klæði  and sjáum in Icelandic progressed to sjǫ́um   sjǫ́m   sjám  The jj and vv of Proto Germanic became ggj and ggw respectively in Old Norse  a change known as Holtzmann s law   5 2  Epenthesis  An epenthetic vowel became popular by 1200 in Old Danish  1250 in Old Swedish and Norwegian  and 1300 in Old Icelandic  An unstressed vowel was used which varied by dialect  Old Norwegian exhibited all three   u  was used in West Norwegian south of Bergen  as in aftur  aftor  older aptr   North of Bergen   i  appeared in aftir  after  and East Norwegian used  a   after  aftær   6  Syntax  Old Norse had a freer word order than English  Old Norse used different listing structures than the English   a  b and c   and   a  b or c   In those two cases  Old Norse would have   a and b and c   or   a and b or c    7  Grammar  Old Norse was a moderately inflected language with high levels of nominal and verbal inflection  Most of the fused morphemes are retained in modern Icelandic  especially in regard to noun case declensions  whereas modern Norwegian in comparison has moved towards more analytical word structures   7 1  Gender  Old Norse had three grammatical genders – masculine  feminine or neuter  Adjectives or pronouns referring to a noun must mirror the gender of that noun  so that one says   heill maðr   but   heilt barn   Like in other languages  the grammatical gender of an impersonal noun is generally unrelated to an expected natural gender of that noun  While indeed karl   man  is masculine  kona   woman   is feminine  and hús  house  is neuter  so also are hrafn and kráka  for  raven  and  crow   masculine and feminine respectively  even in reference to a female raven or a male crow   All neuter words have identical nominative and accusative forms  and all feminine words have identical nominative and accusative plurals   The gender of some words  plurals does not agree with that of their singulars  such as lim and mund  Some words  such as hungr  have multiple genders  evidenced by their determiners being declined in different genders within a given sentence   7 1 1  Hierarchy  Old Norse inherited the Proto Germanic feature of having neuter as the default gender  This means that when the gender of a noun is unknown  adjectives and pronouns referencing it use the neuter gender forms  rather than the masculine or feminine  Thus  if speaking or writing to a general audience  one would say velkomit   well is it come   rather than velkominn or velkomin   well is  he or she  come   as one does not know whether the person hearing it is going to be male or female   One generally sees adjectives in their neuter form when used pronominally for this reason  For words more commonly used in this way  rather than to describe a noun  one sees their neuter forms more often than their masculine or feminine  Normally the masculine form would be the most beneficial form of an adjective to learn first  given that the majority of nouns are masculine  In these cases  however  the most practical form to learn first would be the neuter   7 2  Morphology  Nouns  adjectives and pronouns were declined in four grammatical cases — nominative  accusative  genitive and dative  in singular and plural numbers  Adjectives and pronouns were additionally declined in three grammatical genders  Some pronouns  first and second person  could have dual number in addition to singular and plural  The genitive is used partitively  and quite often in compounds and kennings  e g   Urðarbrunnr  the well of Urðr  Lokasenna  the gibing of Loki    There were several classes of nouns within each gender  the following is an example of the  strong  inflectional paradigms   In addition to these examples there were the numerous  weak  noun paradigms  which had a much higher degree of syncretism between the different cases in its paradigms  i e  they didn t have as many forms as the  strong  nouns   A definite article was realised as a suffix  that retained an independent declension e g  troll  a troll  – trollit  the troll   hǫll   a hall  – hǫllin  the hall   armr  an arm  – armrinn  the arm   This definite article  however  was a separate word  and did not become attached to the noun before later stages of the Old Norse period   8  Texts  The earliest inscriptions in Old Norse are runic  from the 8th century  Runes continued to be commonly used until the 15th century and have been recorded to be in use in some form as late as the 19th century in some parts of Sweden  With the conversion to Christianity in the 11th century came the Latin alphabet  The oldest preserved texts in Old Norse in the Latin alphabet date from the middle of the 12th century  Subsequently  Old Norse became the vehicle of a large and varied body of vernacular literature  unique in medieval Europe  Most of the surviving literature was written in Iceland  Best known are the Norse sagas  the Icelanders  sagas and the mythological literature  but there also survives a large body of religious literature  translations into Old Norse of courtly romances  classical mythology  and the Old Testament  as well as instructional material  grammatical treatises and a large body of letters and official documents   9  Dialects  Most of the innovations that appeared in Old Norse spread evenly through the Old Norse area  As a result  the dialects were very similar and considered to be the same language  a language that they sometimes called the Danish tongue  Dǫnsk tunga   sometimes Norse language  Norrœnt mál   as evidenced in the following two quotes from Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson   Móðir Dyggva var Drótt  dóttir Danps konungs  sonar Rígs er fyrstr var konungr kallaðr á danska tungu  Dyggvi s mother was Drott  the daughter of king Danp  Ríg s son  who was the first to be called king in the Danish tongue      stirt var honum norrœnt mál  ok kylfdi mᴊǫk til orðanna  ok hǫfðu margir menn þat mᴊǫk at spotti     the Norse language was hard for him  and he often fumbled for words  which amused people greatly   However  some changes were geographically limited and so created a dialectal difference between Old West Norse and Old East Norse   As Proto Norse evolved into Old Norse  in the 8th century  the effects of the umlauts seem to have been very much the same over the whole Old Norse area  But in later dialects of the language a split occurred mainly between west and east as the use of umlauts began to vary  The typical umlauts  for example fylla from *fullijan  were better preserved in the West due to later generalizations in the east where many instances of umlaut were removed  many archaic Eastern texts as well as eastern runic inscriptions however portray the same extent of umlauts as in later Western Old Norse    All the while  the changes resulting in breaking  for example hiarta from *hertō  were more influential in the East probably once again due to generalizations within the inflectional system  This difference was one of the greatest reasons behind the dialectalization that took place in the 9th and 10th centuries  shaping an Old West Norse dialect in Norway and the Atlantic settlements and an Old East Norse dialect in Denmark and Sweden   Old West Norse and Old Gutnish did not take part in the monophthongization which changed æi  ei  into ē  øy  ey  and au into ø̄  nor did certain peripheral dialects of Swedish  as seen in modern Ostrobothnian  Another difference was that Old West Norse lost certain combinations of consonants  The combinations  mp    nt   and  nk  were assimilated into  pp    tt  and  kk  in Old West Norse  but this phenomenon was limited in Old East Norse   Here is a comparison between the two dialects as well as Old Gutnish  It is a transcription from one of the Funbo Runestones  U 990  meaning   Veðr and Thane and Gunnar raised this stone after Haursi  their father  God help his spirit   The OEN original text above is transliterated according to traditional scholarly methods  wherein u umlaut is not regarded in runic Old East Norse  Modern studies have shown that the positions where it applies are the same as for runic Old West Norse  An alternative and probably more accurate transliteration would therefore render the text in OEN as such   Some past participles and other words underwent i umlaut in Old West Norse but not in Old East Norse dialects  Examples of that are Icalandic slegið sleginn and tekið tekinn  which in Swedish are slagit slagen and tagit tagen  This can also be seen in the Icelandic and Norwegian words sterkur and sterk   strong    which in Swedish is stark as in Old Swedish  These differences can also be seen in comparison between Norwegian and Swedish   9 1  Old West Norse  The combinations  mp    nt   and  nk  mostly merged to  pp    tt  and  kk  in Old West Norse at around the 7th century  marking the first distinction between the Eastern and Western dialects  3 The following table illustrates this  Note the influence of Danish on Norwegian and East West Norse on each other     An early difference between Old West Norse and the other dialects was that Old West Norse had the forms bú  dwelling   kú  accusative for cow  and trú  faith  whereas Old East Norse had bō  kō and trō  Old West Norse was also characterized by the preservation of u umlaut  which meant that for example Proto Norse *tanþu  tooth  was pronounced tǫnn and not tann as in post runic Old East Norse  OWN gǫ́s and runic OEN gǭs  while post runic OEN gās  goose    The earliest body of text appears in runic inscriptions and in poems composed ca 900 by Þjóðólfr of Hvinir  The earliest manuscripts are from the period 1150–1200 and concern both legal  religious and historical matters  During the 12th and 13th centuries  Trøndelag and Western Norway were the most important areas of the Norwegian kingdom and they shaped Old West Norse as an archaic language with a rich set of declensions  In the body of text that has come down to us from until ca 1300  Old West Norse had little dialect variation  and Old Icelandic does not diverge much more than the Old Norwegian dialects do from each other   Old Norwegian differentiated early from Old Icelandic by the loss of the consonant h in initial position before l  n and r  thus whereas Old Icelandic manuscripts might use the form hnefi  fist   Old Norwegian manuscripts might use nefi   From the late 13th century  Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian started to diverge more  After c  1350  the Black Death and following social upheavals seem to have accelerated language changes in Norway  From the late 14th century  the language used in Norway is generally referred to as Middle Norwegian   Old West Norse underwent a lengthening of initial vowels at some point  especially in Norwegian  so that OWN eta became éta  ONW akr   ákr  OIC ek   ék   9 1 1  Old Icelandic  In Iceland  initial before was lost  Compare Icelandic rangur with Norwegian vrangr  OEN vrangʀ  This change is shared with Old Gutnish   A specifically Icelandic sound  the long  u umlauted A  spelled Ǫ́ and pronounced   developed circa the early 11th century  It was short lived  being marked in the Grammatical Treatises and remaining until the end of the 12th century   merged with during the 12th century  This caused to become an independent phoneme from   and the written distinction of for from medial and final to become merely etymological   Around the 13th century  Œ Ǿ    merged to Æ     Thus  pre 13th century grœnn  green  became modern Icelandic grænn  The 12th century Grágás manuscripts distinguish the vowels  and so the Codex Regius copy does as well  However  the 13th century Codex Regius copy of the Poetic Edda probably relied on newer and or poorer quality sources — Demonstrating either difficulty with or total lack of natural distinction  the manuscripts show separation of the two phonemes in some places  but frequently mix up the letters chosen to distinguish them in others   Towards the end of the 13th century  Ę    merged to E      9 1 2  Old Norwegian  Around the 11th century  Old Norwegian     and

Icelandic colonies in Greenland  When the colonies died out around the 15th century  the dialect went with it    and some merged to   so that Old Icelandic Þórðr becomes Tortr   9 1 4  Text example  The following text is from Alexanders saga  an Alexander romance  The manuscript  AM 519 a 4to  is dated c  1280  The facsimile demonstrates the sigla used by scribes to write Old Norse  Many of these were borrowed from Latin  Without familiarity with these abbreviations  the facsimile will be unreadable to many  In addition  reading the manuscript itself requires familiarity with the letterforms of the native script  The abbreviations are expanded in a version with normalized spelling like the standard normalization system s  Comparing this to the spelling of the same text in Modern Icelandic shows that  while pronunciation has changed greatly  spelling has changed little   a printed in uncial  Uncials not encoded separately in Unicode as of this section s writing   9 2  Old East Norse  Old East Norse  between 800 and 1100  is in Sweden called Runic Swedish and in Denmark Runic Danish  The use of Swedish and Danish is not for linguistic reasons as the differences between them are minute at best during the more ancient stages of this dialect group  Changes had a tendency to occur earlier in the Danish region and until this day many Old Danish changes have still not taken place in modern Swedish rendering Swedish as the more archaic out of the two concerning both the ancient and the modern languages  sometimes by a profound margin but in all differences are still minute  They are called runic because the body of text appears in runes   Runic Old East Norse is characteristically archaic in form  especially Swedish  which is still true for modern Swedish compared to Danish   In essence it matches or surpasses the archaicness of post runic Old West Norse which in its turn is generally more archaic than post runic Old East Norse  While typically  Eastern  in structure  many later post runic changes and trademarks of EON had yet to happen   The phoneme ʀ  which evolved during the Proto Norse period from z  was still clearly separated from r in most positions  even when being geminated  while in OWN it had already merged with r   Monophthongization of æi   and øy  au   started in mid 10th century Denmark  Compare runic OEN  fæigʀ  gæiʀʀ  haugʀ

and vágir  modern Swedish solar  hamnar  vågar  suns  havens  scales  Danish has mainly lost the distinction between the two stems with both endings now being rendered as  er or  e alternatively for the o stems    Vice versa  masculine i stems with the root ending in either g or k tended to shift the plural ending to that of the ja stems while OWN kept the original  drængiaʀ  *ælgiaʀ and *bænkiaʀ while OWN drengir  elgir  elks  and bekkir  modern Swedish drängar  älgar  bänkar    The plural ending of ja stems were mostly preserved while those of OWN often acquired that of the i stems  *bæðiaʀ

in Denmark that the first innovations appeared that would differentiate Old Danish from Old Swedish 3 as these innovations spread north unevenly  unlike the earlier changes that spread more evenly over the East Norse area  creating a series of isoglosses going from Zealand to Svealand   In Old Danish  merged with during the 9th century  From the 11th to 14th centuries  the unstressed vowels  a   o and  e  standard normalization  a   u and  i  started to merge into  ə  represented with the letter e  This vowel came to be epenthetic  particularly before  ʀ endings  At the same time  the voiceless stop consonants p  t and k became voiced plosives and even fricative consonants  Resulting from these innovations  Danish has kage  cake   tunger  tongues  and gæster  guests  whereas  Standard  Swedish has retained older forms  kaka  tungor and gäster  OEN kaka  tungur  gæstir    Moreover  the Danish pitch accent shared with Norwegian and Swedish changed into stød around this time   9 2 2  Old Swedish  At the end of the 10th and early 11th century initial h  before l  n and r was still preserved in the middle and northern parts of Sweden  and is sporadically still preserved in some northern dialects as g   e g  gly  lukewarm   from hlýʀ   The Dalecarlian dialects developed as Old Swedish dialects and as such can be considered separate languages from Swedish  One such language is Elfdalian  spoken in the Älvdalen municipality of Sweden  by about 1 000–5 000 speakers  various sources   This language is only comprehensible with great difficulty and to a limited extent to speakers of the other Scandinavian languages   9 2 3  Text example  This is an extract from Västgötalagen  the Westrogothic law  It is the oldest text written as a manuscript found in Sweden and from the 13th century  It is contemporaneous with most of the Icelandic literature  The text marks the beginning of Old Swedish as a distinct dialect   Dræpær maþar svænskan man eller smalenskæn

thirteen marks  but no weregild        If someone slays a Dane or a Norwegian  he will pay nine marks  If someone slays a foreigner  he shall not be banished and have to flee to his clan  If someone slays a foreign priest  he will pay as much as for a fellow countryman  A priest counts as a freeman  If a Southerner is slain or an Englishman  he shall pay four marks to the plaintiff and two marks to the king   9 3  Old Gutnish  Due to Gotland s early isolation from the mainland  many features of Old Norse did not spread from or to the island  and Old Gutnish developed as an entirely separate branch from Old East and West Norse  For example  the diphthong ai in aigu  þair and waita was not retroactively umlauted to ei as in e g  Old Icelandic eigu  þeir and veita  Breaking was especially active in Old Gutnish  leading to forms such as bjera and bjauþa  mainland bera and bjúþa  Dropping of  w  in initial  wɾ  is shared only with Old Icelandic   9 3 1  Text example  The Gutasaga is the longest text surviving from Old Gutnish  It was written in the 13th century and dealt with the early history of the Gotlanders  This part relates to the agreement that the Gotlanders had with the Swedish king sometime before the 9th century   So gingu gutar sielfs wiliandi vndir suia kunung þy at þair mattin frir Oc frelsir sykia suiariki j huerium staþ  vtan tull oc allar utgiftir  So aigu oc suiar sykia gutland firir vtan cornband ellar annur forbuþ  hegnan oc hielp sculdi kunungur gutum at waita  En þair wiþr þorftin  oc kallaþin  sendimen al oc kunungr oc ierl samulaiþ a gutnal þing senda  Oc latta þar taka scatt sinn  þair sendibuþar aighu friþ lysa gutum alla steþi til sykia yfir haf sum upsala kunungi til hoyrir  Oc so þair sum þan wegin aigu hinget sykia  So  by their own will  the Gotlanders became the subjects of the Swedish king  so that they could travel freely and without risk to any location in the Swedish kingdom without toll and other fees  Likewise  the Swedes had the right to go to Gotland without corn restrictions or other prohibitions  The king was to provide protection and help  when they needed it and asked for it  The king and the jarl shall send emissaries to the Gutnish thing to receive the taxes  These emissaries shall declare free passage for the Gotlanders to all locations in the sea of the king at Uppsala  that is the Baltic Sea was under Swedish control  and likewise for everyone who wanted to travel to Gotland   10  Relationship to other languages  10 1  Relationship to English  Old English and Old Norse were closely related languages  It is therefore not surprising that many words in Old Norse look familiar to English speakers  e g   armr  arm   fótr  foot   land  land   fullr  full   hanga  to hang   standa  to stand    This is because both English and Old Norse stem from a Proto Germanic mother language  In addition  numerous common  everyday Old Norse words mainly of East Norse origin were adopted into the Old English language during the Viking age  A few examples of Old Norse loanwords in modern English are  English Viking age Old East Norse    Nouns – anger  angr   bag  baggi   bait  bæit  bæita  bæiti

Prenominal adjectives – same  sami  In a simple sentence like  They are both weak  the extent of the Old Norse loanwords becomes quite clear  Old East Norse with archaic pronunciation   Þæiʀ eʀu báðiʀ wæikiʀ  while Old English  híe syndon bégen  þá  wáce    The words  they  and  weak  are both borrowed from Old Norse  and the word  both  might also be a borrowing  though this is disputed  While the number of loanwords adopted from the Norse was not as numerous as that of Norman French or Latin  their depth and every day nature make them a substantial and very important part of every day English speech as they are part of the very core of the modern English vocabulary   Words like  bull  and  Thursday  are more difficult when it comes to their origins   Bull  may be from either Old English  bula  or Old Norse  buli   while  Thursday  may be a borrowing  or it could simply be from the Old English  Þunresdæg   which could have been influenced by the Old Norse cognate  The word  are  is from Old English  earun   aron   which stems back to Proto Germanic as well as the Old Norse cognates   10 2  Relationship to modern Scandinavian languages  11  See also  Old Norse orthography — The
