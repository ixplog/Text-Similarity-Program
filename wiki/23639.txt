Gasoline   or petrol   is a transparent  petroleum derived liquid that is used primarily as a fuel in internal combustion engines  It consists mostly of organic compounds obtained by the fractional distillation of petroleum  enhanced with a variety of additives  a 42 gallon barrel of crude oil yields about 19 gallons of gasoline  when processed in an oil refinery   The  anti knock  characteristic of a particular gasoline blend  when used as a fuel in internal combustion engines  is measured by its octane rating  Gasoline is produced in several grades of octane rating  Tetraethyl lead and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to regulate and increase octane rating  but many other additives are put into gasoline to improve its chemical stability  control corrosiveness and provide fuel system  cleaning   and determine performance characteristics under intended use  Sometimes  gasoline also contains ethanol as an alternative fuel  for economic or environmental reasons   Gasoline  as used worldwide in the vast number of internal combustion engines used in transport and industry  has a significant impact on the environment  both in local effects  e g   smog  and in global effects  e g   effect on the climate   Gasoline may also enter the environment uncombusted  as liquid and as vapors  from leakage and handling during production  transport and delivery  from storage tanks  from spills  etc  As an example of efforts to control such leakage  many  underground  storage tanks are required to have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent such leaks  The material safety data sheet for unleaded gasoline shows at least 15 hazardous chemicals occurring in various amounts  Benzene and many anti knocking additives are carcinogenic   Inhaled  huffed  gasoline vapor is a common intoxicant that has become epidemic in some poorer communities and indigenous groups in Australia  Canada  New Zealand  and some Pacific Islands  In response  Opal fuel has been developed by the BP Kwinana Refinery in Australia  and contains only 5% aromatics  unlike the usual 25%   which weakens the effects of inhalation   1  Octane rating  Spark ignition engines are designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration  In some cases  however  the unburned mixture can autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone  rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time  which causes rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine  This phenomenon is often referred to as engine knocking or end gas knock  One way to reduce knock in spark ignition engines is to increase the gasoline s resistance to autoignition  which is expressed by its octane rating   Octane rating is measured relative to a mixture of 2 2 4 trimethylpentane  an isomer of octane  and n heptane  There are different conventions for expressing octane ratings  so a fuel may have several different octane ratings based on the measure used  Research octane number  RON  for commercially available gasoline varies by country  In Finland  Sweden  and Norway  95 RON is the standard for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option  In the UK  ordinary regular unleaded gasoline is 95 RON  commonly available   premium unleaded gasoline is always 97 RON  and super unleaded is usually 97 98 RON  However  both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high performance engines  and the supermarket chain Tesco began in 2006 to sell super unleaded gasoline rated at 99 RON  In the US  octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 85 and 87 AKI  91 92 RON  for regular  through 89 90 AKI  94 95 RON  for mid grade  European regular   up to 90 94 AKI  95 99 RON  for premium  European premium    South Africa s largest city  Johannesburg  is located on the Highveld at above sea level  So the South African AA recommends 95 octane petrol  gasoline  as low altitude and 93 octane for use in Johannesburg because  The higher the altitude the lower the air pressure  and the lower the need for a high octane fuel as there is no real performance gain    The octane rating became important as the military sought higher output for aircraft engines in the late 1930s and the 1940s  A higher octane rating allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost  and thus higher temperatures and pressures  which translate to higher power output  Some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power  In 1943  the Rolls Royce Merlin aero engine produced 1320 horsepower  984 kW  using 100 RON fuel from a modest 27 liter displacement  Towards the end of the second world war  experiments were conducted using 150 RON fuel  100 150 avgas   obtained by adding 2 5% aniline to 100 octane avgas   2  Stability  Quality gasoline should be stable almost indefinitely if stored properly  Such storage should be in an airtight container  to prevent oxidation or water vapors mixing  that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting   to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions  at a stable cool temperature  to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion  and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions   When gasoline is not stored correctly  gums and solids may be created  which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces  resulting in a condition called  stale fuel   Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture  then forming gums  solids  or two phases  a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water alcohol phase    The presence of these degradation products in fuel tank  lines  carburetor or fuel injection components makes it harder to start the engine  or causes reduced engine performance  On resumption of regular engine use  the buildup is often eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline  The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly  Some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits  isopropyl alcohol  1 2 4 trimethylbenzene or other additives  Fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines  such as lawnmower and tractor engines  especially when their use is seasonal  low to no use for one or more seasons of the year   Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure  to avoid storage at high temperatures  to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage  and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor   3  Energy content  Energy is obtained from the combustion of gasoline by the conversion of a hydrocarbon to carbon dioxide and water  The combustion of octane follows this reaction   Gasoline contains about 42 4 MJ kg  120 MJ US gal  33 3 kWh US gal  quoting the lower heating value   Gasoline blends differ  and therefore actual energy content varies according to the season and producer by up to 4% more or less than the average  according to the US EPA  On average  about 74 L of gasoline  19 5 US gal  16 3 imp gal  are available from a barrel of crude oil  about 46% by volume   varying due to quality of crude and grade of gasoline  The remainder are products ranging from tar to naphtha   A high octane rated fuel  such as liquefied petroleum gas  LPG  has an overall lower power output at the typical 10 1 compression ratio of a gasoline engine  However  with an engine tuned to the use of LPG  i e  via higher compression ratios  such as 12 1 instead of 10 1   the power output can be improved  This is because higher octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking  resulting in a higher cylinder temperature  which improves efficiency  Also  increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke  which is by far the greater effect  The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high pressure gas created by the combustion process  An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages  chiefly detonation  of a high compression ratio  A high expansion ratio is also one of the two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines  along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow   The lower energy content  per liter  of LPG in comparison to gasoline is due mainly to its lower density  Energy content per kilogram is higher than for gasoline  higher hydrogen to carbon ratio  for an example see Standard enthalpy of formation    Molecular weights of the above reagents are C8H18 114  O2 32  CO2 44  H2O 18  therefore 1 kg of fuel reacts with 3 51 kg of oxygen to produce 3 09 kg of carbon dioxide and 1 42 kg of water   4  Density  The density of gasoline ranges from 0 71–0 77 kg L     0 026 lb in3  6 073 lb US gal  7 29 lb imp gal   higher densities having a greater volume of aromatics  Since gasoline floats on water  water cannot generally be used to extinguish a gasoline fire unless used in a fine mist  Finished marketable gasoline is traded with a standard reference of 0 755 kg L  and its price is escalated de escalated according to its actual density   5  Chemical analysis and production  Gasoline is produced in oil refineries  Roughly 19 gallons of gasoline is derived from a 42 gallon barrel of crude oil  Material separated from crude oil via distillation  called virgin or straight run gasoline  does not meet specifications for modern engines  particularly the octane rating  see below   but can be pooled to the gasoline blend   The bulk of a typical gasoline consists of hydrocarbons with between 4 and 12 carbon atoms per molecule  commonly referred to as C4 C12    The various refinery streams blended to make gasoline have different characteristics  Some important streams are   straight run gasoline  usually also called naphtha is distilled directly from crude oil  Once the leading source of fuel  its low octane rating required lead additives  It is low in aromatics  depending on the grade of crude oil   containing some cycloalkanes  naphthenes  and no olefins  Between 0 and 20% of this stream is pooled into the finished gasoline  because the supply of this fraction is insufficient and its RON is too low   The chemical properties  namely octane and RVP  of the straight run gasoline can be improved through reforming and isomerisation  However  before feeding those units  the naphtha needs to be split in light and heavy naphtha  Straight run gasoline can be also used as a feedstock into steam crackers to produce olefins   reformate  produced in a catalytic reformer has a high octane rating with high aromatic content  and relatively low olefins  alkenes   Most of the benzene  toluene  and xylene  the so called BTX  are more valuable as chemical feedstocks and are thus removed to some extent   catalytic cracked gasoline or catalityc cracked naphtha  produced from a catalytic cracker  with a moderate octane rating  high olefins  alkene  content  and moderate aromatics level   hydrocrackate  heavy  mid  and light  produced from a hydrocracker  with medium to low octane rating and moderate aromatic levels   alkylate is produced in an alkylation unit  using as feedstocks isobutane and alkenes  Alkylate contains nil aromatics and olefins and has high MON   isomerate is obtained by isomerizing low octane straight run gasoline to iso parafins  like isooctane   Isomerate has medium RON and MON  but nil aromatics and olefins  The terms above are the jargon used in the oil industry and terminology varies   Overall  a typical gasoline is predominantly a mixture of paraffins  alkanes   cycloalkanes  naphthenes   and olefins  alkenes   The actual ratio depends on   the oil refinery that makes the gasoline  as not all refineries have the same set of processing units   crude oil feed used by the refinery   the grade of gasoline  in particular  the octane rating  Currently  many countries set limits on gasoline aromatics in general  benzene in particular  and olefin  alkene  content  Such regulations led to increasing preference for high octane pure paraffin  alkane  components  such as alkylate  and is forcing refineries to add processing units to reduce benzene content  In the EU the benzene limit is set at 1% volume for all grade of automotive gasoline   Gasoline can also contain other organic compounds  such as organic ethers  deliberately added   plus small levels of contaminants  in particular organosulfur compounds  but these are usually removed at the refinery   6  Additives  6 1  Antiknock additives  Almost all countries in the world have phased out automotive leaded fuel  In 2011 six countries in the world were still using leaded gasoline  Afghanistan  Myanmar  North Korea  Algeria  Iraq and Yemen  It was expected that by the end of 2013 those countries would ban leaded petrol  but actually it will take longer  Algeria will replace leaded with unleaded automotive fuel only in 2015  Different additives have replaced the lead compounds  The most popular additives include aromatic hydrocarbons  ethers and alcohol  usually ethanol or methanol   For technical reasons the use of leaded additives is still permitted world wide for the formulation of some grades of aviation gasoline such as 100LL  because the required octane rating would be technically infeasible to reach without the use of leaded additives   6 1 1  Tetraethyllead  Gasoline  when used in high compression internal combustion engines  tends to autoignite  detonate  causing damaging  engine knocking   also called  pinging  or  pinking   noise  To address this problem  tetraethyllead  TEL  was widely adopted as an additive for gasoline in the 1920s  With the discovery of the extent of environmental and health damage caused by the lead  however  and the incompatibility of lead with catalytic converters  leaded gasoline was phased out beginning in 1973  By 1995  leaded fuel accounted for only 0 6% of total gasoline sales and less than 2000 short tons  1814 t  of lead per year in the USA  From 1 January 1996  the U S  Clean Air Act banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on road vehicles in the USA  The use of TEL also necessitated other additives  such as dibromoethane  First European countries started replacing lead by the end of the 1980s and by the end of the 1990s leaded petrol was banned within the entire European Union   6 1 2  MMT  Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl  MMT  is used in Canada and in Australia to boost octane  It also helps old cars designed for leaded fuel run on unleaded fuel without need for additives to prevent valve problems  Its use in the US has been restricted by regulations   6 2  Fuel stabilizers  antioxidants and metal deactivators   Gummy  sticky resin deposits result from oxidative degradation of gasoline upon long term storage  These harmful deposits arise from the oxidation of alkenes and other minor components in gasoline  see drying oils   Improvements in refinery techniques have generally reduced the susceptibility of gasolines to these problems  Previously  catalytically or thermally cracked gasolines are most susceptible to oxidation  The formation of these gums is accelerated by copper salts  which can be neutralized by additives called metal deactivators   This degradation can be prevented through the addition of 5–100 ppm of antioxidants  such as phenylenediamines and other amines  Hydrocarbons with a bromine number of 10 or above can be protected with the combination of unhindered or partially hindered phenols and oil soluble strong amine bases  such as hindered phenols   Stale  gasoline can be detected by a colorimetric enzymatic test for organic peroxides produced by oxidation of the gasoline   Gasolines are also treated with metal deactivators  which are compounds that sequester  deactivate  metal salts that otherwise accelerate the formation of gummy residues  The metal impurities might arise from the engine itself or as contaminants in the fuel   6 3  Detergents  Gasoline  as delivered at the pump  also contains additives to reduce internal engine carbon buildups  improve combustion  and to allow easier starting in cold climates  High levels of detergent can be found in Top Tier Detergent Gasolines  The specification for Top Tier Detergent gasolines was developed by four automakers  GM  Honda  Toyota and BMW  According to the bulletin  the minimal EPA requirement is not sufficient to keep engines clean  Typical detergents include alkylamines and alkyl phosphates at the level of 50 100 ppm   6 4  Ethanol  6 4 1  European Union  In the EU  5% ethanol can be added within the common gasoline spec  EN 228   Discussions are ongoing to allow 10% blending of ethanol  available in Finnish  French and German gas stations   In Finland most gasoline stations sell 95E10  which is 10% of ethanol  and 98E5  which is 5% ethanol  Most gasoline sold in Sweden has 5 15% ethanol added   6 4 2  Brazil  In Brazil  the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum  Natural Gas and Biofuels  ANP  requires gasoline for automobile use to have from 18 to 25% of ethanol added to its composition   6 4 3  Australia  Legislation requires retailers to label fuels containing ethanol on the dispenser  and limits ethanol use to 10% of petrol in Australia  Such petrol is commonly called E10 by major brands  and it is cheaper than regular unleaded petrol   6 4 4  United States of America  The federal Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS  effectively requires refiners and blenders to blend renewable biofuels  mostly ethanol  with gasoline  sufficient to meet a growing annual target of total gallons blended  Although the mandate does not require a specific percentage of ethanol  annual increases in the target combined with declining gasoline consumption has caused the typical ethanol content in gasoline to approach 10%  Most fuel pumps display a sticker that states that the fuel may contain up to 10% ethanol  an intentional disparity that reflects the varying actual percentage  Until late 2010  fuels retailers were only authorized to sell fuel containing up to 10 percent ethanol  E10   and most vehicle warranties  except for flexible fuel vehicles  authorize fuels that contain no more than 10 percent ethanol  In parts of the United States  ethanol is sometimes added to gasoline without an indication that it is a component   6 4 5  India  The Government of India in October 2007 decided to make 5% ethanol blending  with gasoline  mandatory  Currently  10% Ethanol blended product  E10  is being sold in various parts of the country   6 5  Dye  In Australia  the lowest grade of petrol  RON 91  is dyed a light shade of red orange and the medium grade  RON 95  is dyed yellow   In the United States  aviation gasoline  avgas  is dyed to identify its octane rating and to distinguish it from kerosene based jet fuel  which is clear   In Canada the gasoline for marine and farm use is dyed red and is not subject to road tax    6 6  Oxygenate blending  Oxygenate blending adds oxygen bearing compounds such as MTBE  ETBE and ethanol  The presence of these oxygenates reduces the amount of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust gas  In many areas throughout the US  oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants  For example  in Southern California  fuel must contain 2% oxygen by weight  resulting in a mixture of 5 6% ethanol in gasoline  The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline  RFG  or oxygenated gasoline  or in the case of California  California reformulated gasoline  The federal requirement that RFG contain oxygen was dropped on 6 May 2006 because the industry had developed VOC controlled RFG that did not need additional oxygen   MTBE use is being phased out in some states due to issues with contamination of ground water  In some places  such as California  it is already banned  Ethanol and  to a lesser extent  the ethanol derived ETBE are common replacements  A common ethanol gasoline mix of 10% ethanol mixed with gasoline is called gasohol or E10  and an ethanol gasoline mix of 85% ethanol mixed with gasoline is called E85  The most extensive use of ethanol takes place in Brazil  where the ethanol is derived from sugarcane  In 2004  over 3 4 billion US gallons  2 8 billion imp gal 13 million m³  of ethanol was produced in the United States for fuel use  mostly from corn  and E85 is slowly becoming available in much of the United States  though many of the relatively few stations vending E85 are not open to the general public  The use of bioethanol  either directly or indirectly by conversion of such ethanol to bio ETBE  is encouraged by the European Union Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport  Since producing bioethanol from fermented sugars and starches involves distillation  though  ordinary people in much of Europe cannot legally ferment and distill their own bioethanol at present  unlike in the US  where getting a BATF distillation permit has been easy since the 1973 oil crisis    7  Safety  7 1  Environmental considerations  Combustion of of gasoline produces of carbon dioxide  2 3 kg l   a greenhouse gas   The main concern with gasoline on the environment  aside from the complications of its extraction and refining  is the potential effect on the climate  Unburnt gasoline and evaporation from the tank  when in the atmosphere  react in sunlight to produce photochemical smog  Vapor pressure initially rises with some addition of ethanol to gasoline  but the increase is greatest at 10% by volume  At higher concentrations of ethanol above 10%  the vapor pressure of the blend starts to decrease  At a 10% ethanol by volume  the rise in vapor pressure may potentially increase the problem of photochemical smog  This rise in vapor pressure could be mitigated by increasing the percentage of ethanol in the gasoline mixture   The chief risks of such leaks come not from vehicles  but from gasoline delivery truck accidents and leaks from storage tanks  Because of this risk  most  underground  storage tanks now have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent any such leaks  such as monitoring systems  Veeder Root  Franklin Fueling    7 2  Toxicity  The material safety data sheet for unleaded gasoline shows at least 15 hazardous chemicals occurring in various amounts  including benzene  up to 5% by volume   toluene  up to 35% by volume   naphthalene  up to 1% by volume   trimethylbenzene  up to 7% by volume   methyl tert butyl ether  MTBE   up to 18% by volume  in some states  and about ten others  Hydrocarbons in gasoline generally exhibit low acute toxicities  with LD50 of 700 – 2700 mg kg for simple aromatic compounds  Benzene and many antiknocking additives are carcinogenic   7 3  Inhalation  Huffed gasoline is a common intoxicant that has become epidemic in some poorer communities and indigenous groups in Australia  Canada  New Zealand  and some Pacific Islands  In response  Opal fuel has been developed by the BP Kwinana Refinery in Australia  and contains only 5% aromatics  unlike the usual 25%   which weakens the effects of inhalation   7 4  Flammability  Like other hydrocarbons  gasoline burns in a limited range of its vapor phase and  coupled with its volatility  this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present  Gasoline has a lower explosion limit of 1 4% by volume and an upper explosion limit of 7 6%  If the concentration is below 1 4%  the air gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite  If the concentration is above 7 6%  the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite  However  gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air  making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable   8  Use and pricing  The United States accounts for about 44% of the world’s gasoline consumption  In 2003 The US consumed   which equates to of gasoline each day  The US used about of gasoline in 2006  of which 5 6% was mid grade and 9 5% was premium grade   8 1  Europe  Unlike the US  countries in Europe impose substantial taxes on fuels such as gasoline  The price of gasoline in Europe is typically more than twice that in the US  In Italy  due to the amendments imposed by Monti s Government in December 2011  the price of gasoline has passed  in the period of two weeks  from 1 50 € l  7 48 US$ gal  to 1 75 € l  8 72 US$ gal   on March 17  a gasoline station located near Ancona has reached the psychological threshold of 2 € l  the price was €2 001 l  9 97 US$ gal   This chart must be compared to the USA national average price of gasoline of 0 71 € l   8 2  United States  From 1998 to 2004  the price of gasoline fluctuated between $1 and $2 USD per U S  gallon  After 2004  the price increased until the average gas price reached a high of $4 11 per U S  gallon in mid 2008  but receded to approximately $2 60 per U S  gallon by September 2009  More recently  the U S  experienced an upswing in gas prices through 2011  and by 1 March 2012  the national average was $3 74 per gallon   In the United States  most consumer goods bear pre tax prices  but gasoline prices are posted with taxes included  Taxes are added by federal  state  and local governments  As of 2009  the federal tax is 18 4¢ per gallon for gasoline and 24 4¢ per gallon for diesel  excluding red diesel   Among states  the highest gasoline tax rates  including the federal taxes as of 2005  are New York  62 9¢ gal   Hawaii  60 1¢ gal   and California  60¢ gal   However  many states  taxes are a percentage and thus vary in amount depending on the cost of the gasoline   About 9% of all gasoline sold in the US in May 2009 was premium grade  according to the Energy Information Administration  Consumer Reports magazine says  “If  your owner’s manual  says to use regular fuel  do so—there’s no advantage to a higher grade ” The Associated Press said premium gas—which is a higher octane and costs more per gallon than regular unleaded—should be used only if the manufacturer says it is “required”  Cars with turbocharged engines and high compression ratios often specify premium gas because higher octane fuels reduce the incidence of  knock   or fuel pre detonation  If regular fuel is used  the engine computer usually switches to a less aggressive fuel map to protect the engine  and performance is decreased   9  History  The first automotive combustion engines  so called Otto engines  were developed in the last quarter of the 19th century in Germany  The fuel was a relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained from coal gas  With a boiling point near 85 °C  octanes boil about 40 °C higher   it was well suited for early carburetors  evaporators   The development of a  spray nozzle  carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels  Further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher compression ratios  but early attempts were blocked by knocking  premature explosion of fuel   In the 1920s  antiknock compounds were introduced by Migley and Boyd  specifically tetraethyllead  TEL   This innovation started a cycle of improvements in fuel efficiency that coincided with the large scale development of oil refining to provide more products in the boiling range of gasolines  In the 1950s oil refineries started to focus on high octane fuels  and then detergents were added to gasoline to clean the jets and carburetors  The 1970s witnessed greater attention to the environmental consequences of burning gasoline  These considerations led to the phasing out of TEL and its replacement by other antiknock compounds  Subsequently  low sulfur gasoline was introduced  in part to preserve the catalysts in modern exhaust systems   10  Etymology and terminology   Gasoline  is cited  under the spelling  gasolene   from 1863 in the Oxford English Dictionary  It was never a trademark  although it may have been derived from older trademarks such as  Cazeline  and  Gazeline    Variant spellings of  gasoline  have been used to refer to raw petroleum since the 16th century   Petrol  was first used as the name of a refined petroleum product around 1870 by British wholesaler Carless  Capel & Leonard  who marketed it as a solvent  When the product later found a new use as a motor fuel  Frederick Simms  an associate of Gottlieb Daimler  suggested to Carless that they register the trade mark  petrol   but by this time the word was already in general use  possibly inspired by the French pétrole  and the registration was not allowed  Carless registered a number of alternative names for the product  while their competitors used the term  motor spirit  until the 1930s   In many countries  gasoline has a colloquial name derived from that of the chemical benzene  e g   German Benzin  Dutch benzine  Italian benzina  Polish benzyna  Chile bencina  Thai เบนซิน bayn sin   Greek βενζίνη venzini  Romanian benzină  Swedish bensin  Arabic بنزين binzīn   Argentina  Uruguay and Paraguay use the colloquial name nafta derived from that of the chemical naphtha   The terms  mogas   short for motor gasoline  or  autogas   short for automobile gasoline  are used to distinguish automobile fuel from aviation fuel  or  avgas    11  Comparison with other fuels  Volumetric and mass
