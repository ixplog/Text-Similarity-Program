Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple  red maple  or black maple trees  although it can also be made from other maple species  In cold climates  these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter  the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in the spring  Maple trees can be tapped by boring holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap  The sap is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water  leaving the concentrated syrup   Maple syrup was first collected and used by the indigenous peoples of North America  The practice was adopted by European settlers  who gradually refined production methods  Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing  The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer  responsible for about three quarters of the world s output  Canadian exports of maple syrup exceed C$145 million  approximately US$130 5 million  per year  Vermont is the largest producer in the United States  generating about 5 5 percent of the global supply   Maple syrup is graded according to the Canada  United States  or Vermont scales based on its density and translucency  Sucrose is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup  In Canada  syrups must be at least 66 percent sugar and be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup  In the United States  a syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap to be labelled as  maple   though states such as Vermont and New York have more restrictive definitions  see below    Maple syrup is often eaten with pancakes  waffles  French toast  or oatmeal and porridge  It is also used as an ingredient in baking  and as a sweetener or flavouring agent  Culinary experts have praised its unique flavour  although the chemistry responsible is not fully understood   1  Sources  Three species of maple trees are predominantly used to produce maple syrup  the sugar maple  Acer saccharum   the black maple  A  nigrum   and the red maple  A  rubrum   because of the high sugar content  roughly two to five percent  in the sap of these species  The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of A  saccharum  the sugar maple  by some botanists  Of these  the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples  which alters the flavour of the sap   A few other  but not all  species of maple  Acer  are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple syrup  including the box elder or Manitoba maple  Acer negundo   the silver maple  A  sacharinum   and the bigleaf maple  A  macrophyllum   Similar syrups may also be produced from birch or palm trees  among other sources   2  History  2 1  Indigenous peoples  Indigenous peoples living in the northeastern part of North America were the first groups known to have produced maple syrup and maple sugar  According to aboriginal oral traditions  as well as archaeological evidence  maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region  There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began  but various legends exist  one of the most popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief  Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho  Glooskap  or the squirrel  Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar making  celebrating the Sugar Moon  the first full moon of spring  with a Maple Dance  Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup   The Algonquians recognized maple sap as a source of energy and nutrition  At the beginning of the spring thaw  they used stone tools to make V shaped incisions in tree trunks  they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into buckets  which were often made from birch bark  The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top  While there was widespread Agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States  the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in the Northeast that is not a European colonial import   2 2  Europeans  In the early stages of European colonization in northeastern North America  indigenous peoples showed the arriving colonists how to tap the trunks of certain types of maples during the spring thaw to harvest the sap  Andr√© Thevet  the  Royal Cosmographer of France   wrote about Jacques Cartier drinking maple sap during his Canadian voyages  By 1680  European settlers and fur traders were involved in harvesting maple products  However  rather than making incisions in the bark as the indigenous inhabitants did  the Europeans used the method of drilling tapholes in the trunks with augers  During the 17th and 18th centuries  processed maple sap was used primarily as a source of concentrated sugar  in both liquid and crystallized solid form  as cane sugar had to be imported from the West Indies   Maple sugaring parties typically began to operate at the start of the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples  Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks  usually more than one hole per large tree  they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap  The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment s core from one end of the cylinder  creating a seamless  watertight container  Sap filled the buckets  and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels  barrels  large pots  or hollowed out wooden logs   often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals  or carried in buckets or other convenient containers  The sap collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees  and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained  sweet   The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were  and still are  critical in determining the length of the sugaring season  As the weather continues to warm  a maple tree s normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap  making it unpalatable  perhaps due to an increase in amino acids   The boiling process was very time consuming  The harvested sap was transported back to the party s base camp  where it was then poured into large vessels  usually made from metal  and boiled to achieve the desired consistency  The sap was usually transported using large barrels pulled by horses or oxen to a central collection point  where it was processed either over a fire built out in the open or inside a shelter built for that purpose  the  sugar shack     2 3  Modern era  Around the time of the American Civil War  syrup makers started using large  flat sheet metal pans as they were more efficient for boiling than heavy  rounded iron kettles  because of a greater surface area for evaporation  Around this time  cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US  as a result  producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup  The first evaporator  used to heat and concentrate sap  was patented in 1858  In 1872  an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox  which greatly decreased boiling time  Around 1900  producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues  which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time  Some producers also added a finishing pan  a separate batch evaporator  as a final stage in the evaporation process   Buckets began to be replaced with plastic bags  which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected  Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped  the sugarbush  to the evaporator  Some producers adopted motor powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container  but these techniques were not widely used  Heating methods also diversified  modern producers use wood  oil  natural gas  propane  or steam to evaporate sap  Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup   A large number of technological changes took place during the 1970s  Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since the early part of the century were perfected  and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house  Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems  and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam  Producers developed reverse osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled  increasing processing efficiency   Improvements in tubing and vacuum pumps  new filtering techniques   supercharged  preheaters  and better storage containers have since been developed  Research continues on pest control and improved woodlot management  In 2009  researchers at the University of Vermont unveiled a new type of tap that prevents backflow of sap into the tree  reducing bacterial contamination and preventing the tree from attempting to heal the bore hole  Experiments show that it may be possible to use saplings in a plantation instead of mature trees dramatically boosting productivity per acre   3  Processing  Production methods have been streamlined since colonial days  yet remain basically unchanged  Sap must first be collected and boiled down to obtain pure syrup without chemical agents or preservatives  Maple syrup is made by boiling between 20 and 50 volumes of sap  depending on its concentration  over an open fire until 1 volume of syrup is obtained  usually at a temperature over the boiling point of water  As the boiling point of water varies with changes in air pressure the correct value for pure water is determined at the place where the syrup is being produced  each time evaporation is begun and periodically throughout the day  Syrup can be boiled entirely over one heat source or can be drawn off into smaller batches and boiled at a more controlled temperature   Boiling the syrup is a tightly controlled process  which ensures appropriate sugar content  Syrup boiled too long will eventually crystallize  whereas under boiled syrup will be watery  and will quickly spoil  The finished syrup has a density of 66¬∞ on the Brix scale  a hydrometric scale used to measure sugar solutions   The syrup is then filtered to remove sugar sand  crystals made up largely of sugar and calcium malate  These crystals are not toxic  but create a  gritty  texture in the syrup if not filtered out  The filtered syrup is graded and packaged while still hot  usually at a temperature of or greater  The containers are turned over after being sealed to sterilize the cap with the hot syrup  Packages can be made of metal  glass  or coated plastic  depending on volume and target market  The syrup can also be heated longer and further processed to create a variety of other maple products  including maple sugar  maple butter or cream  and maple candy or taffy   3 1  Off flavours  Off flavours can sometimes develop during the production of maple syrup  causes include contaminants in the boiling apparatus  such as paint or cleanser  changes in the sap  such as fermentation when it has been left sitting too long  and changes in the tree  such as  buddy sap  late in the season when budding has begun  In some circumstances it is possible to remove off flavours through processing   4  Production  Maple syrup production is centred in northeastern North America  however  given the correct weather conditions  it can be made wherever suitable species of maple trees grow   A maple syrup production farm is called a  sugarbush  or  sugarwood   Sap is often boiled in a  sugar house   also known as a  sugar shack    sugar shanty   or cabane √† sucre   a building louvered at the top to vent the steam from the boiling sap   Maples are usually tapped beginning at 30 to 40 years of age  Each tree can support between one and three taps  depending on its trunk diameter  The average maple tree will produce of sap per season  up to per day  This is roughly equal to 7% of its total sap  Seasons last for four to eight weeks  depending on the weather  During the day  starch stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap  allowing it to be tapped  Sap is not tapped at night because the temperature drop inhibits sap flow  although taps are typically left in place overnight  Some producers also tap in autumn  though this practice is less common than spring tapping  Maples can continue to be tapped for sap until they are over 100 years old   5  Commerce  Until the 1930s  the United States produced most of the world s maple syrup  Today  after rapid growth in the 1990s  Canada produces more than 80 percent of the world s maple syrup  producing about in 2004  The vast majority of this comes from the province of Quebec  which is the world s largest producer  with about 75 percent of global production totalling in 2005  As of 2003  Quebec had more than 7 000 producers  collectively making over of syrup  Production in Quebec is controlled through a supply management system  with producers receiving quota allotments from the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers  F√©d√©ration des producteurs ac√©ricoles du Qu√©bec   which also maintains reserves of syrup  Canada exports more than of maple syrup per year  valued at more than C$145 million  The provinces of Ontario  Nova Scotia  New Brunswick  and Prince Edward Island produce smaller amounts of syrup   The Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan produce maple syrup using the sap of the box elder or Manitoba maple  Acer negundo   A Manitoba maple tree s yield is usually less than half that of a similar sugar maple tree  Manitoba maple syrup has a slightly different flavour from sugar maple syrup  because it contains less sugar and the tree s sap flows more slowly   Vermont is the biggest US producer  with over during the 2013 season  followed by New York with and Maine with   Wisconsin  Ohio  New Hampshire  Michigan  Pennsylvania  Massachusetts  and Connecticut all produced marketable quantities of maple syrup of less than each in 2013  As of 2003  Vermont produced about 5 5 percent of the global syrup supply   Maple syrup has been produced on a small scale in some other countries  notably Japan and South Korea  However  in South Korea in particular  it is traditional to consume maple sap  called gorosoe  instead of processing it into syrup  Japan is a large importer of maple syrup  in 2010  10 1 percent of Canada s maple syrup exports  a value of C$28 million  went to Japan   6  Grades  In Canada  maple syrup is classified by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency  CFIA  as one of three grades  each with several colour classes  Canada No  1  including Extra Light  Light  and Medium  No  2 Amber  and finally No  3 Dark or any other ungraded category  Producers in Ontario or Qu√©bec may follow either federal or provincial grading guidelines  Qu√©bec s and Ontario s guidelines differ slightly from the federal  there are two  number  categories in Qu√©bec  Number 1  with four colour classes  and 2  with five colour classes   As in Qu√©bec  Ontario s producers have two  number  grades  1  with three colour classes  and 2  with one colour class  which is typically referred to as  Ontario Amber  when produced and sold in that province only  A typical year s yield for a maple syrup producer will be about 25 to 30 percent of each of the #1 colours  10 percent #2 Amber  and 2 percent #3 Dark  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors  at the request of the International Maple Syrup Institute   The United States uses different grading standards  Maple syrup is divided into two major grades  Grade A and Grade B  Grade A is further divided into three subgrades  Light Amber  sometimes known as Fancy   Medium Amber  and Dark Amber  The Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets uses a similar grading system of colour  and is roughly equivalent  especially for lighter syrups  but using letters   AA    A   etc  The Vermont grading system differs from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density  measured on the Baum√© scale   New Hampshire maintains a similar standard  but not a separate state grading scale  The Vermont graded product has 0 9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US graded  One grade of syrup not for table use  called commercial or Grade C  is also produced under the Vermont system  Vermont inspectors enforce strict syrup grading regulations  and can fine producers up to US$1000 for labeling syrup incorrectly   Extra Light and Grade A typically have a milder flavour than Grade B  which is very dark  with a rich maple flavour  The dark grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking  although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use  Syrup harvested earlier in the season tends to yield a lighter color  The classification of maple syrup in the US depends ultimately on its translucence  US Grade A Light Amber has to be more than 75 percent translucent  US Grade A Medium Amber has to be 60 5 to 74 9 percent translucent  US Grade A Dark Amber has to be 44 0 to 60 4 percent translucent  and US Grade B is any product less than 44 0 percent translucent   The International Maple Syrup Institute has been working on international grading standards so that all producers will use the same grading system  Transition to the new system is expected in the coming years  Beginning in 2014  Vermont has adopted a new grading system replacing the previous five grades from Fancy to Grade C  to four levels of color and flavor intensity  All grades will now be Grade A  to reflect that there is not a difference in quality  but rather in color and flavor intensity   7  Food and nutrition  The basic ingredient in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various other species of maple trees  It consists primarily of sucrose and water  with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the invert sugar created in the boiling process  Organic acids  the most notable one being malic acid  make the syrup slightly acidic  Maple syrup has a relatively low mineral content  consisting largely of potassium and calcium  but also contains nutritionally significant amounts of zinc and manganese  Maple syrup also contains trace amounts of amino acids  which may contribute to the  buddy  flavour of syrup produced late in the season  as the amino acid content of sap increases at this time  Additionally  maple syrup contains a wide variety of volatile organic compounds  including vanillin  hydroxybutanone  and propionaldehyde  It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for maple syrup s distinctive flavour  however its primary flavour contributing compounds are maple furanone  strawberry furanone  and maltol   Maple syrup is similar to sugar with respect to calorie content  but is a source of manganese  with 13 grams containing about 0 44 milligrams  or 22 percent of the US Food and Drug Administration Daily Value  DV%  of 2 milligrams  It is also a source of zinc with 13 grams containing 0 55 milligrams or 3 7 percent of the DV% of 15 milligrams  Compared to honey  maple syrup has 15 times more calcium and 1 10 as much sodium  A number of new compounds have been identified in maple syrup  one of which is quebecol  a natural phenolic compound created when the maple sap is boiled to create syrup   British culinary expert Delia Smith described maple syrup as  a unique ingredient  smooth  and silky textured  with a sweet  distinctive flavour ‚Äì hints of caramel with overtones of toffee will not do ‚Äì and a rare colour  amber set alight  Maple flavour is  well  maple flavour  uniquely different from any other   Agriculture Canada has developed a  flavour wheel  that details 91 unique flavours that can be present in maple syrup  These flavours are divided into 13 families  vanilla  empyreumatic  burnt   milky  fruity  floral  spicy  foreign deterioration or environment  maple  confectionery  plants forest humus cereals  herbaceous  or ligneous  These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to wine tasting  Other culinary experts praise its unique flavour   Maple syrup and its various artificial imitations are widely used as toppings for pancakes  waffles  and French toast in North America  They can also be used to flavour a variety of foods  including fritters  ice cream  hot cereal  fresh fruit  and sausages  It is also used as sweetener for granola  applesauce  baked beans  candied sweet potatoes  winter squash  cakes  pies  breads  tea  coffee  and hot toddies  Maple syrup can also be used as a replacement for honey in wine  mead    8  Imitations and substitutions  In the United States   maple syrup  must be made almost entirely from maple sap  although small amounts of substances such as salt may be added   Maple flavoured  syrups include maple syrup but may contain additional ingredients   Pancake syrup    waffle syrup    table syrup   and similarly named syrups are substitutes which are less expensive than maple syrup  In these syrups  the primary ingredient is most often high fructose corn syrup flavoured with sotolon  they have no genuine maple content  and are usually thickened far beyond the viscosity of maple syrup  The fenugreek seed  a spice with high amounts of sotolon  can be prepared to have a maple like flavour  and is used to make a very strong commercial flavouring that is similar to maple syrup  but much less expensive  one such syrup  Mapleine  was popular during the Great Depression  American labelling laws prohibit imitation syrups from having  maple  in their names   In Canada  maple syrup must be made entirely from maple sap  and syrup must have a density of 66¬∞ on the Brix scale to be marketed as maple syrup  Qu√©b√©cois sometimes refer to imitation maple syrup as sirop de poteau   pole syrup    a joke referring to the syrup as having been made by tapping telephone poles   Imitation syrups are generally cheaper than maple syrup  but tend to taste artificial  A 2009 Cook s Illustrated comparison between top selling maple and imitation syrups consistently rated the real maple brands  Maple Grove Farms  Highland Sugarworks  Camp Maple  Spring Tree  and Maple Gold  above the imitation brands tested  Eggo  Aunt Jemima  Mrs  Butterworth s  Log Cabin  and Hungry Jack    9  Cultural significance  Maple syrup and maple sugar were used during the American Civil War and by abolitionists in the years prior to the war because most cane sugar and molasses were produced by Southern slaves  Because of food rationing during the Second World War  people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple sugar  and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source   Maple products are considered emblematic of Canada  in particular Quebec  and are frequently sold in tourist shops and airports as souvenirs from Canada  The sugar maple s leaf has come to symbolize Canada  and is depicted on the country s flag  Several US states  including New York  Vermont and Wisconsin  have the sugar maple as their state tree  A scene of sap collection is depicted on the Vermont state quarter  issued in 2001   10  See also  Birch syrup  List of foods
