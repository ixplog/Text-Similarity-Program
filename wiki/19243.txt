the census in the government controlled area and the census in Transnistria in 2004 they account for 69 6% of the country s population  The proportion of Ukrainians and Russians decreased considerably in comparison to the last Soviet census in 1989  from 13 8% to 11 2% and from 13 0% to 9 4% respectively  This is mostly due to emigration  Ukrainians mostly live in the east  Transnistria  and the

Population by district  according to the 2004 census   1There is an ongoing controversy over whether Moldovans are a subset of Romanians  or a distinct ethnic group  At the 2004 Moldovan Census  citizens could declare only one nationality  Consequently  one could not declare oneself both Moldovan and Romanian   4 3  Transnistrian controlled areas  Notes   The exact numbers in the above table are taken from the data published by the Transnistrian breakaway authorities after the 2004 Census in Transnistria  except the population of Roghi  which was taken from website of the Dubăsari District of Transnistria   The number of inhabitants of Slobozia District + that of the commune Chiţcani was given by Transnisrian authorities as 95 742  Other sources indicate ~9 000 for Chiţcani  In this table it is assumed there are 9 000 inhabitantts in Chiţcani  and 86 742 in Slobozia District  Should the exact data of the census for Chiţcani be available  the entries in the lines of Slobozia District and of Chiţcani should be corrected accordingly   Transnistrian authorities have published the ethnic composition for the combined population of the Dubăsari District and the village of Roghi in Molovata Nouă commune  Other sources indicate that the latter is almost entirely Moldovan  In this table it is assumed that of the 715 inhabitants of this village  700 are Moldovan and 15 are others  Should the exact ethnicity data of the census for Roghi be available  the entries for ethnicities in the lines of Dubăsari District and of Roghi should be corrected accordingly   Percentages are calculated from the absolute numbers  5  Languages  Romanian is the official language of Moldova  However  many speakers use the term Moldovan to describe the language they speak  despite the fact

did not answer that question  a Known as Creştini după Evanghelie  Pentecostal group  b Traditionally Orthodox Lipovans   History  In 1940–1941  and 1944–1991  the Soviet government strictly limited the activities of the Orthodox Church  and all religions  and at times sought to exploit it  with the ultimate goal of abolishing it and all religious activity altogether  Most Orthodox churches and monasteries in Moldova were demolished or converted to other uses  such as administrative buildings or warehouses  and clergy were sometimes punished for leading services  Still  many believers continued to practice their faith   People in the independent Moldova have much greater religious freedom than they did in Soviet times  Legislation passed in 1992 guarantees religious freedom  but requires all religious groups to be officially recognized by the government   Orthodox Christians  In 1991  Moldova had 853 Orthodox churches and eleven Orthodox monasteries  four for monks and seven for nuns   In 1992 construction or restoration of 221 churches was underway  but clergy remained in short supply  As of 2004  Christian Orthodox constitute the vast majority of the population in all districts of Moldova   In the interwar period  the vast majority of ethnic Moldovans belonged to the Romanian Orthodox Church  Bucharest Patriarchate   but today both Romanian and Russian Orthodox Church  Moscow Patriarchate  have jurisdiction in Moldova  with the latter having more parishes  According to the local needs  liturgy is performed in Romanian  Russian  and Turkic  Gagauz   After the revival of religious activity in the last 20 years  a minority of the clergy and the faithful wanted to return to the Bucharest Patriarchate  Metropolis of Bessarabia   Because higher level church authorities were unable to resolve the matter  Moldova now has two episcopates  one for each patriarchate  After the Soviet occupation in 1940  the Metropolis was downgraded to a Bishopric  In late 1992  the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia issued a decree upgrading its eparchy of Chişinău and Moldova to a Metropolis   Greek Catholics  Moldova also has a Greek Catholic minority  mainly among ethnic Ukrainians  although the Soviet government declared the Greek Catholic Churches illegal in 1946 and forcibly united them with the Russian Orthodox Church  However  the Greek Catholic Churches had survived underground until the dissolution of the Soviet Union   Roman Ctholics  Half of Moldova s Roman Catholics are in Chişinău  and 1 5 in Bălţi   Old Believers  In addition  the Old Russian Orthodox Church  Old Believers  had fourteen churches and one monastery in Moldova in 1991   Half of Moldova s Old Believers are in Floreşti district  and 1 5 in Sîngerei district   Judaism  Despite the Soviet government s suppression and harassment  Moldova s practicing Jews managed to retain their religious identity  About a dozen Jewish newspapers were started in the early 1990s  and religious leaders opened a synagogue in Chişinău  there were six Jewish communities of worship throughout the country  In addition  Moldova s government created the Department of Jewish Studies at Chişinău State University  mandated the opening of a Jewish high school in Chişinău  and introduced classes in Judaism in high schools in several cities  The government also provides financial support to the Society for Jewish Culture   Protestants  There are around 65 000 Protestants of all sects in Moldova today  There are more than 1 000 Baptists in the cities of Chişinău and Bălţi  in Cahul  Făleşti  Hînceşti  Sîngerei  Ştefan Vodă  and Ungheni districts  and in Găgăuzia  There are more than 1 000 Seventh day Adventists in Cahul  Hînceşti and Sîngerei districts  and in Găgăuzia  there are more than 1 000 Penticostals in Chişinău and in Briceni district  There are more than 1 000 members of Brethren assemblies only in Chişinău  There are more than 1 000 Evangelical Synod Presbyterians only in Chişinău   Others  Other religious denominations in Moldova include   Armenian Apostolic Church  Molokans  a Russian Orthodox sect    7  Analysis  Moldova s territory is generally ethnically homogeneous  Moldovans form majorities in 33 of the 37 first tier territorial units  including over 90% in 15 districts  between 80% and 90% in 9 districts  between 70% and 80% in 7 administrative units  and between 50% and 60% in two units   and a 33 5% plurality in Transnistria  where there are 32% Ukrainians and 27% Russians  Gagauzians represent an 82% majority in the autonomous territorial unit of Gagauzia  with only 5% Moldovans  Bulgarians represent a 66% majority in the Taraclia district  with 14% Moldovans  Finally  Russians represent a 43% plurality in the municipality of Bender  with 25% Moldovans  Ukrainians represent between 20% and 30% minorities in four units with Moldovan majority  Bălţi  Briceni  Ocniţa  and Rîşcani  and one with Moldovan plurality  Transnistria   Elsewhere  the ethnic populations are under 20% district wise  generally much less   The Romanians are concentrated in the municipality of Chişinău  home to 44% of the Romanians in Moldova  although they represent only 4 5% of the population of the municipality   Although before 1991 Moldova was the most densely populated of the former Soviet republics  129 inhabitants per square kilometer in 1990  compared with 13 inhabitants per square kilometer for the Soviet Union as a whole   it had and has only few large cities   The largest and most important of these is Chişinău  the country s capital and its most important industrial center  with a population of 712 218 in 2004  The city s population is 67 62% Moldovan  13 92% Russian  8 28% Ukrainian  4 5% Romanians and 5 69% others  Bulganians  Gagauzians  Jews  Poles  Gypsies  etc    The proportion of Russophones living in Moldova decreased in the years immediately after 1989 because of the emigration to Russia  after an immigration from Russia had taken place during the Soviet period   The second largest city in the country  Tiraspol  had a population of 184 000 in 1990  Located in Transnistria  with a population of 158 069 in 2004  it is the capital of the breakaway republic  In contrast to Chişinǎu  Tiraspol has only some 15% Moldovans  with Russians comprising 41 7%  and Ukrainians 33%  Due to deportations by the breakaway authorities  and emigration during and after the 1992 War of Transnistria  it has been reported that the Moldovan and Romanian populations have gone down by up to 10 000 since 1990   Other important cities include Bălţi  with a population of 162 000 in 1990  and 127 561 in 2004  and Bender  with a population of 132 000 in 1990 and 100 169 in 2004  Other major cities include Rîbniţa  population 53 648  Cahul  population 35 488  Ungheni  population 32 530  Soroca  population 28 362  and Orhei  population 25 641   Traditionally a predominantly rural country  Moldova gradually began changing its character in the 20th century  As urban areas became the sites of new industrial and intellectual jobs and amenities such as hospitals  the population of cities and towns grew  The Soviets kept the population of Moldova under control with the famous Soviet policy of propiska  which forbade a person to live in another locality than the one written in his or her identity documents without approval of Soviet authorities  The new residents of Moldova s cities during the Soviet era were not only Moldovans  who had moved from the nearby rural areas  but also many Russians and Ukrainians who had been recruited to fill positions in industry and government  moving in from other parts of the Soviet Union   Many people emigrated to Romania in 1940  estimated at 200 000  and 1944  estimated at more than 200 000   and others had lost their lives during the war  over 100 000 as Soviet soldiers in 1944–1945  and up to 50 000 as Romanian soldiers before 1944  including as Soviet POWs in 1944–1945   in Stalinist persecutions  over 8 000 executed  ca  50 000 sent to Gulag  over 200 000 deported   and during the 1946–1947 famine  216 000 deceased   During the 1940s  thousands of young people were recruited to work in large scale Soviet construction projects  Then  as a consequence of industrial growth after 1956  there was significant immigration to the Moldavian SSR by representatives of other ethnic groups  especially Russians and Ukrainians   At the time of the 1989 census  Moldova s total population was 4 335 400  The largest ethnic group  Moldovans  numbered 2 795 000  accounting for 64 5% of the population  The other major ethnicities were Ukrainians  about 600 000  14%   Russians  about 562 000  13 0%   Gagauz  about 153 000  4%   Bulgarians  about 88 000  2%   and Jews  about 66 000  2 0%   There were also smaller but appreciable numbers of Poles and Roma in the population  In Transnistria ethnic Moldovans accounted for 40% of the population in 1989  followed by Ukrainians  28%   and Russians  25%   In the early 1990s  there was significant emigration from the republic  primarily from urban areas and mainly by non Moldovan minorities  Moldovans made up a sizable proportion of the urban population in 1989  about half the population of Chişinǎu and other cities   as well as a large proportion of the rural population  over 85%   but only 23% of the ethnic Moldovans lived in the republic s ten largest cities  with the rest of the community being predominantly rural   Unlike Moldovans  Russians tend to be urban dwellers in Moldova  more than 72% of them lived in the ten largest cities in 1989  Many of them came to the Moldova after it was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940  Some of them came to alleviate the postwar shortage of qualified labor in the Moldavian SSR  which was created by the rapid industrialization  but also by the loss of human life during the war  deportations  and famine  Ethnic Russians settled mainly in Chişinǎu  Bălţi  Bender  and in the cities of the eastern bank of the Dniester  such as Tiraspol  Rîbniţa  and Dubăsari  Only about 25% of Moldova s Russians lived in Transnistria in 1990  as many as in Chişinǎu alone   In 1990  Moldova s divorce rate of 3 0 divorces per 1 000 population had risen from the 1987 rate of 2 7 divorces per 1 000 population  The usual stresses of marriage were exacerbated by a society in which women were expected to perform most of the housework in addition to their work outside the home  Compounding this were crowded housing conditions  with their resulting lack of privacy  and the growing economic crisis   8  See also  Aging of Europe  9  References  Inline  General   10  External links    a Red Cross report about impact of demographic
