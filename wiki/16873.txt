The is a Japanese traditional garment  The word  kimono   which literally means a  thing to wear   ki  wear  and mono  thing    has come to denote these full length robes  The standard plural of the word kimono in English is kimonos  but the unmarked Japanese plural kimono is also sometimes used   Kimono are T shaped  straight lined robes worn so that the hem falls to the ankle  with attached collars and long  wide sleeves  Kimono are wrapped around the body  always with the left side over the right  except when dressing the dead for burial  and secured by a sash called an obi  which is tied at the back  Kimono are generally worn with traditional footwear  especially zōri or geta  and split toe socks  tabi    Today  kimono are most often worn by women  and on special occasions  Traditionally  unmarried women wore a style of kimono called furisode  with almost floor length sleeves  on special occasions  A few older women and even fewer men still wear the kimono on a daily basis  Men wear the kimono most often at weddings  tea ceremonies  and other very special or very formal occasions  Professional sumo wrestlers are often seen in the kimono because they are required to wear traditional Japanese dress whenever appearing in public   1  History  As the kimono has another name    the earliest kimonos were heavily influenced by traditional Han Chinese clothing  known today as   through Japanese embassies to China which resulted in extensive Chinese culture adoptions by Japan  as early as the 5th century AD  It was during the 8th century  however  that Chinese fashions came into style among the Japanese  and the overlapping collar became particularly women s fashion  During Japan s Heian period  794–1192 AD   the kimono became increasingly stylized  though one still wore a half apron  called a mo  over it  During the Muromachi age  1392–1573 AD   the Kosode  a single kimono formerly considered underwear  began to be worn without the hakama  trousers  divided skirt  over it  and thus began to be held closed by an obi  belt   During the Edo period  1603–1867 AD   the sleeves began to grow in length  especially among unmarried women  and the Obi became wider  with various styles of tying coming into fashion  Since then  the basic shape of both the men’s and women’s kimono has remained essentially unchanged  Kimonos made with exceptional skill from fine materials have been regarded as great works of art   The formal kimono was replaced by the more convenient Western clothes and yukata as everyday wear  After an edict by Emperor Meiji  police  railroad men and teachers moved to Western clothes  The Western clothes became the army and school uniform for boys  After the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake  kimono wearers often became victims of robbery because they could not run very fast due to the restricting nature of the kimono on the body and geta clogs  The Tokyo Women s & Children s Wear Manufacturers  Association  東京婦人子供服組合  promoted Western clothes  Between 1920 and 1930 the sailor outfit replaced the undivided hakama in school uniforms for girls  The 1932 fire at Shirokiya s Nihonbashi store is said to have been the catalyst for the decline in kimonos as everyday wear  Kimono clad Japanese women did not wear panties and several women refused to jump into safety nets because they were ashamed of being seen from below   It is  however  suggested  that this is an urban myth   The national uniform  Kokumin fuku  国民服   a type of Western clothes  was mandated for males in 1940  Today most people wear Western clothes and wear the breezier and more comfortable yukata for special occasions   In the Western world  kimono styled women s jackets  similar to a casual cardigan  gained public attention as a popular fashion item in 2014   2  Textiles and manufacture  Kimonos for men should fall approximately to the ankle without tucking  A woman s kimono has additional length to allow for the ohashori  the tuck that can be seen under the obi  which is used to adjust the kimono to the wearer  An ideally tailored kimono has sleeves that fall to the wrist when the arms are lowered   Kimonos are traditionally made from a single bolt of fabric called a tan  Tan come in standard dimensions—about 36 centimetres wide and 11 5 metres long—and the entire bolt is used to make one kimono  The finished kimono consists of four main strips of fabric—two panels covering the body and two panels forming the sleeves—with additional smaller strips forming the narrow front panels and collar  Historically  kimonos were often taken apart for washing as separate panels and resewn by hand  Because the entire bolt remains in the finished garment without cutting  the kimono can be retailored easily to fit another person   The maximum width of the sleeve is dictated by the width of the fabric  The distance from the center of the spine to the end of the sleeve could not exceed twice the width of the fabric  Traditional kimono fabric was typically no more than wide  Thus the distance from spine to wrist could not exceed a maximum of roughly   Modern kimono fabric is woven as wide as to accommodate modern Japanese body sizes  Very tall or heavy people  such as sumo wrestlers  must have kimonos custom made by either joining multiple bolts  weaving custom width fabric  or using non standard size fabric   Traditionally  kimonos are sewn by hand  even machine made kimonos require substantial hand stitching  Kimono fabrics are frequently hand made and  decorated  Techniques such as yūzen dye resist are used for applying decoration and patterns to the base cloth  Repeating patterns that cover a large area of a kimono are traditionally done with the yūzen resist technique and a stencil  Over time there have been many variations in color  fabric and style  as well as accessories such as the obi   The kimono and obi are traditionally made of silk  silk brocade  silk crepes  such as chirimen  and satin weaves  such as rinzu   Modern kimonos are widely available in less expensive easy care fabrics such as rayon  cotton sateen  cotton  polyester and other synthetic fibers  Silk is still considered the ideal fabric   Customarily  woven patterns and dyed repeat patterns are considered informal  Formal kimonos have free style designs dyed over the whole surface or along the hem  During the Heian period  kimonos were worn with up to a dozen or more colorful contrasting layers  with each combination of colors being a named pattern  Today  the kimono is normally worn with a single layer on top of one or more undergarments   The pattern of the kimono can determine in which season it should be worn  For example  a pattern with butterflies or cherry blossoms would be worn in spring  Watery designs are common during the summer  A popular autumn motif is the russet leaf of the Japanese maple  for winter  designs may include bamboo  pine trees and plum blossoms   A popular form of textile art in Japan is shibori  intricate tie dye   found on some of the more expensive kimonos and haori kimono jackets  Patterns are created by minutely binding the fabric and masking off areas  then dying it  usually by hand  When the bindings are removed  an undyed pattern is revealed  Shibori work can be further enhanced with yuzen  hand applied  drawing or painting with textile dyes or with embroidery  it is then known as tsujigahana  Shibori textiles are very time consuming to produce and require great skill  so the textiles and garments created from them are very expensive and highly prized   Old kimonos are often recycled in  altered to make haori  hiyoku  or kimonos for children  used to patch similar kimono  used for making handbags and similar kimono accessories  and used to make covers  bags or cases for implements  especially for sweet picks used in tea ceremonies  Damaged kimonos can be disassembled and resewn to hide the soiled areas  and those with damage below the waistline can be worn under a hakama  Historically  skilled craftsmen laboriously picked the silk thread from old kimono and rewove it into a new textile in the width of a heko obi for men s kimono  using a recycling weaving method called saki ori   2 1  Parts  These terms refer to parts of a kimono     upper lining on a woman s kimono     collar     hem guard

undergarments  obi  ties  socks  sandals  and accessories  can exceed US$20 000  A single obi may cost several thousand dollars  However  most kimonos owned by kimono hobbyists or by practitioners of traditional arts are far less expensive  Enterprising people make their own kimono and undergarments by following a standard pattern  or by recycling older kimonos  Cheaper and machine made fabrics can substitute for the traditional hand dyed silk  There is also a thriving business in Japan for second hand kimonos  which can cost as little as ¥500  about $6   Women s obi  however  mostly remain an expensive item  Although simple patterned or plain colored ones can cost as little as ¥1 500  about $18   even a used obi can cost hundreds of dollars  and experienced craftsmanship is required to make them  Men s obi  even those made from silk  tend to be much less expensive  because they are narrower  shorter and less decorative than those worn by women   4  Styles  Kimonos range from extremely formal to casual  The level of formality of women s kimono is determined mostly by the pattern of the fabric  and color  Young women s kimonos have longer sleeves  signifying that they are not married  and tend to be more elaborate than similarly formal older women s kimono  Men s kimonos are usually one basic shape and are mainly worn in subdued colors  Formality is also determined by the type and color of accessories  the fabric  and the number or absence of kamon  family crests   with five crests signifying extreme formality  Silk is the most desirable  and most formal  fabric  Kimonos made of fabrics such as cotton and polyester generally reflect a more casual style   4 1  Women s kimonos  Many modern Japanese women lack the skill to put on a kimono unaided  the typical woman s kimono outfit consists of twelve or more separate pieces that are worn  matched  and secured in prescribed ways  and the assistance of licensed professional kimono dressers may be required  Called upon mostly for special occasions  kimono dressers both work out of hair salons and make house calls   Choosing an appropriate type of kimono requires knowledge of the garment s symbolism and subtle social messages  reflecting the woman s age  marital status  and the level of formality of the occasion   4 1 1  Furisode  4 1 2  Hōmongi  4 1 3  Iromuji  4 1 4  Komon  4 1 5  Mofuku  4 1 6

not including footwear   Men s kimono sleeves are attached to the body of the kimono with no more than a few inches unattached at the bottom  unlike the women s style of very deep sleeves mostly unattached from the body of the kimono  Men s sleeves are less deep than women s kimono sleeves to accommodate the obi around the waist beneath them  whereas on a woman s kimono  the long  unattached bottom of the sleeve can hang over the obi without getting in the way  In the modern era  the principal distinctions between men s kimono are in the fabric  The typical men s kimono is a subdued  dark color  black  dark blues  greens  and browns are common  Fabrics are usually matte  Some have a subtle pattern  and textured fabrics are common in more casual kimono  More casual kimono may be made in slightly brighter colors  such as lighter purples  greens and blues  Sumo wrestlers have occasionally been known to wear quite bright colors such as fuchsia   The most formal style of kimono is plain black silk with five kamon on the chest  shoulders and back  Slightly less formal is the three kamon kimono   5  Accessories and related garments      A wide undersash used to tie the nagajuban and the outer kimono and hold them in place     A detached collar that can be worn instead of a nagajuban in summer  when it can be too hot to comfortably wear a nagajuban  It replaces the nagajuban collar in supporting the kimono s collar     The traditional Japanese undergarment  loin cloth  for adult males  made from a length of cotton     Wooden sandals worn by men and women with yukata  One unique style is worn solely by geisha     A divided  umanoribakama  or undivided skirt  andonbakama  which resembles a wide pair of trousers  traditionally worn by men but contemporarily also by women in less formal situations  A hakama typically is pleated and fastened by ribbons  tied around the waist over the obi  Men s hakama also have a koshi ita  which is a stiff or padded part in the lower back of the wearer  Hakama are worn in several budo arts such as aikido  kendo  iaidō and naginata  Hakama are often worn by women at college graduation ceremonies  and by Miko on shinto shrines  Depending on the pattern and material  hakama can range from very formal to visiting wear     The worker s version of the more formal haori  Often padded for warmth  as opposed to the somewhat lighter happi     A hip  or thigh length kimono like jacket  which adds formality to an outfit  Haori were originally worn only by men  until it became a fashion for women in the Meiji period  They are now worn by both men and women  Men s haori are typically shorter than women s  The was specifically made for armoured samurai to wear     A tasseled  woven string fastener for haori  The most formal color is white     A type of haori traditionally worn by shop keepers and is now associated mostly with festivals     A type of under kimono  historically worn by women beneath the kimono  Today they are only worn on formal occasions such as weddings and other important social events  High class kimonos may have extra layers of lining to emulate the appearance of hiyoku worn beneath      A thin garment similar to an undershirt  It is worn under the nagajuban    Sometimes called a jittoku haori  is a type of haori worn only by men  Jittoku are only made of unlined ro or sha silk gauze regardless of the season  It falls to the hip  and has sewn himo made of the same fabric as the main garment  While a haori has a small sleeve opening like that of a kimono  a jittoku is fully open at the wrist side  Jittoku do not have mon  Jittoku originated in the Kamakura period  1185 1333 CE   and by the Edo period  1603 1868  they were worn with kimono by male doctors  monks  Confucian scholars and tea ceremony masters as kinagashi  as a replacement for hakama   In the modern day they are worn as kinagashi mainly by male practitioners of tea ceremony who have achieved a sufficiently high rank     A kimono shaped robe worn by both men and women beneath the main outer garment  Since silk kimono are delicate and difficult to clean  the nagajuban helps to keep the outer kimono clean by preventing contact with the wearer s skin  Only the collar edge of the nagajuban shows from beneath the outer kimono  Many nagajuban have removable collars  to allow them to be changed to match the outer garment  and to be easily washed without washing the entire garment  While the most formal type of nagajuban are white  they are often as beautifully ornate and patterned as the outer kimono  Since men s kimono are usually fairly subdued in pattern and color  the nagajuban allows for discreetly wearing very striking designs and colors     Hair ornaments worn by women  Many different styles exist  including silk flowers  wooden combs  and jade hairpins     The susoyoke and hadajuban combined into a one piece garment     A narrow sash used to aid in dressing up  often made of silk or wool  They are used to hold virtually anything in place during the process of dressing up  and can be used in many ways depending on what is worn  Some of the karihimos are removed after datejime or obi

men and women  similar in design to flip flops  Their formality ranges from strictly informal to fully formal  They are made of many materials  including cloth  leather  vinyl and woven grass  and can be highly decorated or very simple   5 1  Layering  In modern day Japan the meanings of the layering of kimono and hiyoku are usually forgotten  Only maiko and geisha now use this layering technique for dances and subtle erotic suggestion  usually emphasising the back of the neck  Modern Japanese brides may also wear a traditional Shinto bridal kimono which is worn with a hiyoku   Traditionally kimonos were worn with hiyoku or floating linings  Hiyoku can be a second kimono worn beneath the first and give the traditional layered look to the kimono  Often in modern kimonos the hiyoku is simply the name for the double sided lower half of the kimono which may be exposed to other eyes depending on how the kimono is worn   Old fashioned kimono styles meant that hiyoku were entire under kimono  however modern day layers are usually only partial  to give the impression of layering   6  Care  In the past  a kimono would often be entirely taken apart for washing  and then re sewn for wearing  This traditional washing method is called arai hari  Because the stitches must be taken out for washing  traditional kimono need to be hand sewn  Arai hari is very expensive and difficult and is one of the causes of the declining popularity of kimono  Modern fabrics and cleaning methods have been developed that eliminate this need  although the traditional washing of kimono is still practiced  especially for high end garments   New  custom made kimono are generally delivered to a customer with long  loose basting stitches placed around the outside edges  These stitches are called shitsuke ito  They are sometimes replaced for storage  They help to prevent bunching  folding and wrinkling  and keep the kimono s layers in alignment   Like many other traditional Japanese garments  there are specific ways to fold kimono  These methods help to preserve the garment and to keep it from creasing when stored  Kimonos are often stored wrapped in paper called tatōshi   Kimono need to be aired out at least seasonally and before and after each time they are worn  Many people prefer to have their kimono dry cleaned  Although this can be extremely expensive  it is generally less expensive than arai hari but may be impossible for certain fabrics or dyes   7  References  8  Further reading  9  External links  Look for  textiles  under  decorative arts    9 1  Craft materials
