The Kurds    are an Iranian ethnic group in the Middle East  mostly inhabiting a region known as Kurdistan  which spans adjacent parts of Iran  Iraq  Syria  and Turkey  The Kurds are an Iranian people and speak the Kurdish languages  which form a subgroup of the Northwestern Iranian branch of Iranian languages   The Kurds number about 40 million  the majority living in West Asia  including significant Kurdish diaspora communities in the cities of western Turkey outside of Kurdistan  A recent Kurdish diaspora has developed in Western countries  primarily in Germany  The Kurds are in the majority in the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan and are a significant minority group in the neighboring countries Turkey  Syria and Iran  where Kurdish nationalist movements continue to pursue  greater  autonomy   1  Name  The exact origins of the name Kurd are unclear   The underlying toponym is recorded in Assyrian as Qardu and in Middle Bronze Age  Sumerian  as Kar da  Assyrian Qardu refers to an area in the upper Tigris basin  and it is presumably reflected in corrupted form in Arabic  Quranic  Ǧūdī  re adopted in Kurdish as Cûdî  The name would be continued as the first element in the toponym Corduene  mentioned by Xenophon as the tribe who opposed the retreat of the Ten Thousand through the mountains north of Mesopotamia in the 4th century BC  There are  however  dissenting views  which do not derive the name of the Kurds from Qardu and Corduene but opt for derivation from Cyrtii  Cyrtaei  instead   Regardless of its possible roots in ancient toponymy  the ethnonym Kurd might be derived from a term kwrt  used in Middle Persian as a common noun to refer to  nomads  or  tent dwellers   which could be applied as an attribute to any Iranian group with such a lifestyle  The term gained the characteristic of an ethnonym following the Muslim conquest of Persia  as it was adopted into Arabic and gradually became associated with an amalgamation of Iranian and Iranicised tribes and groups in the region   Sherefxan Bidlisi in the 16th century states that there are four division of  Kurds   Kurmanj  Lur  Kalhor and Guran  each of which speak a different dialect or language variation  Paul  2008  notes that the 16th century usage of the term Kurd as recorded by Bidlisi  regardless of linguistic grouping  might still reflect an incipient Northwestern Iranian  Kurdish  ethnic identity uniting the Kurmanj  Kalhur  and Guran   2  Language  The Kurdish language  Kurdish  Kurdî or کوردی  refers collectively to the related dialects spoken by the Kurds  It is mainly spoken in those parts of Iran  Iraq  Syria and Turkey which comprise Kurdistan  Kurdish holds official status in Iraq as a national language alongside Arabic  is recognized in Iran as a regional language  and in Armenia as a minority language   The Kurdish languages belong to the northwestern sub‑group of the Iranian languages  which in turn belongs to the Indo Iranian branch of the Indo European family   Most Kurds are either bilingual or multilingual  speaking the language of their respective nation of origin  such as Arabic  Persian  and Turkish as a second language alongside their native Kurdish  while those in diaspora communities often speak 3 or more languages  Kurdish Jews and some Kurdish Christians  not to be confused with ethnic Assyrians  usually speak Aramaic  for example  Lishana Deni  as their first language  Aramaic is a Semitic language related to Hebrew and Arabic rather than Kurdish   According to Mackenzie  there are few linguistic features that all Kurdish dialects have in common and that are not at the same time found in other Iranian languages   The Kurdish dialects according to Mackenzie are classified as   Northern group  the Kurmanji dialect group   Central group  part of the Sorani dialect group   Southern group  part of the Sorani dialect group  including Kermanshahi  Ardalani and Laki The Zaza and Gorani are ethnic Kurds  but the Zaza–Gorani languages are not classified as Kurdish   Commenting on the differences between the dialects of Kurdish  Kreyenbroek clarifies that in some ways  Kurmanji and Sorani are as different from each other as English and German  giving the example that Kurmanji has grammatical gender and case endings  but Sorani does not  and observing that referring to Sorani and Kurmanji as  dialects  of one language is supported only by  their common origin   and the fact that this usage reflects the sense of ethnic identity and unity of the Kurds    3  Population  The number of Kurds living in Southwest Asia is estimated at close to 30 million  with another one or two million living in diaspora  Kurds comprise anywhere from 18% to 25% of the population in Turkey  15 20% in Iraq  10% in Iran and 9% in Syria  Kurds form regional majorities in all four of these countries  viz  in Turkish Kurdistan  Iraqi Kurdistan  Iranian Kurdistan and Syrian Kurdistan  The Kurds are the fourth largest ethnic groups in West Asia after the Arabs  Persians  and Turks   The total number of Kurds in McDowall  1991  was placed at 22 5 million  with 48% of this number living in Turkey  18% in Iraq  24% in Iran  and 4% in Syria    Recent emigration accounts for a population of close to 1 5 million in Western countries  about half of them in Germany   A special case are the Kurdish populations in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia  displaced there mostly in the time of the Russian Empire  who underwent independent developments for more than a century and have developed an ethnic identity in their own right  This groups  population was estimated at close to 0 4 million in 1990   4  History  4 1  Antiquity  The term  Kurd  is first encountered in Arabic sources of the seventh century  Books from the early Islamic era  including those containing legends like the Shahnameh and the Middle Persian Kar Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan and other early Islamic sources provide early attestation of the name Kurd   During Sassanid era  in Kar Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan  a short prose work written in Middle Persian  Ardashir I is depicted as having battled the Kurds and their leader  Madig  After initially sustaining a heavy defeat  Ardashir I was successful in subjugating the Kurds  In a letter Ardashir I received from his foe  Ardavan V  which is also featured in the same work  he is referred to as being a Kurd himself  The usage of the term Kurd during this time period most likely was a social term  designating Iranian nomads  rather than a concrete ethnic group  Similarly  in AD 360  the Sassanid king Shapur II marched into the Roman province Zabdicene  to conquer its chief city  Bezabde  present day Cizre  He found it heavily fortified  and guarded by three legions and a large body of Kurdish archers  After a long and hard fought siege  Shapur II breached the walls  conquered the city and massacred all its defenders  Hereafter he had the strategically located city repaired  provisioned and garrisoned with his best troops   There is also a 7th century text by an unidentified author  written about the legendary Christian martyr Mar Qardagh  He lived in the 4th century  during the reign of Shapur II  and during his travels is said to have encountered Mar Abdisho  a deacon and martyr  who  after having been questioned of his origins by Mar Qardagh and his Marzobans  stated that his parents were originally from an Assyrian village called Hazza  but were driven out and subsequently settled in Tamanon  a village in the land of the Kurds  identified as being in the region of Mount Judi   4 2  Medieval period  In the early Middle Ages  the Kurds sporadically appear in Arabic sources  though the term was still not being used for a specific people  instead it referred to an amalgam of nomadic western Iranic tribes  who were distinct from Persians  However  in the High Middle Ages  the Kurdish ethnic identity gradually materialized  as one can find clear evidence of the Kurdish ethnic identity and solidarity in texts of the 12th and 13th century  though  the term was also still being used in the social sense   Al Tabari wrote that in 639  Hormuzan  a Sasanian general originating from a noble family  battled against the Islamic invaders in Khuzestan  and called upon the Kurds to aid him in battle  They were defeated however  and brought under Islamic rule   In 838  a Kurdish leader based in Mosul  named Mir Jafar  revolted against the Caliph Al Mu tasim who sent the commander Itakh to combat him  Itakh won this war and executed many of the Kurds  Eventually Arabs conquered the Kurdish regions and gradually converted the majority of Kurds to Islam  often incorporating them into the military  such as the Hamdanids whose dynastic family members also frequently intermarried with Kurds   In 934 the Daylamite Buyid dynasty was founded  and subsequently conquered most of present day Iran and Iraq  During the time of rule of this dynasty  Kurdish chief and ruler  Badr ibn Hasanwaih  established himself as one of the most important emirs of the time   In the 10th 12th centuries  a number of Kurdish principalities and dynasties were founded  ruling Kurdistan and neighbouring areas   The Shaddadids  951–1174  ruled parts of present day Armenia and Arran   The Rawadid  955–1221  ruled Azerbaijan   The Hasanwayhids  959–1015  ruled western Iran and upper Mesopotamia   The Marwanids  990–1096  ruled eastern Anatolia   The Annazids  990–1117  ruled western Iran and upper Mesopotamia  succeeded the Hasanwayhids    The Kakuyids  1008–1051  ruled Isfahan  Yazd and Abarkuh   The Hazaraspids  1148–1424  ruled southwestern Iran   The Ayyubids  1171–1341  ruled parts of southeastern Anatolia  the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa  Due to the Turkic invasion of Anatolia  the 11th century Kurdish dynasties crumbled and became incorporated into the Seljuk Dynasty  Kurds would hereafter be used in great numbers in the armies of the Zengids  Succeeding the Zengids  the Kurdish Ayyubids established themselves in 1171  first under the leadership of Saladin  Saladin led the Muslims to recapture the city of Jerusalem from the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin  also frequently clashing with the Hashashins  The Ayyubid dynasty lasted until 1341 when the Ayyubid sultanate fell to Mongolian invasions   4 3  Safavid period  The Safavid Dynasty  established in 1501  also established its rule over Kurdish territories  The paternal line of this family actually had Kurdish roots  tracing back to Firuz Shah Zarrin Kolah  a dignitary who moved from Kurdistan to Ardabil in the 11th century   Nevertheless  the Kurds would revolt several times against the Safavids  Shah Ismail I put down a Yezidi rebellion which went on from 1506 1510  A century later  the year long Battle of Dimdim took place  wherein Shah Abbas I succeeded in putting down the rebellion led by Amir Khan Lepzerin  Hereafter  a large number of Kurds was deported to Khorasan  not only to weaken the Kurds  but also to protect the eastern border from invading Afghan and Turkmen tribes  Kurds were found in great numbers at the slave markets of Khiva and Bukhara  being sold by the Turkmens  The Kurds of Khorasan  numbering around 700 000  still use the Kurmanji Kurdish dialect   4 4  Zand Period  After the fall of the Safavids  Iran fell into civil war  with multiple leaders trying to gain control over the country  Ultimately  it was Karim Khan  a Laki general of the Zand tribe  perhaps of Kurdish origin  One of the contenders for power was Karim Khan Zand  a member of the Lak tribe near Shiraz  who proved to be superiour  and became ruler of Iran with the exception of the Khorasan region   The country would flourish during Karim Khan’s reign  a strong resurgence of the arts would take place  the economy was restored and international ties were strengthened  Karim Khan was portrayed as being a ruler who truly cared about his subjects  thereby gaining the title Vakil e Ra’aayaa  Representative of the People    After Karim Khan s death  the dynasty would decline in favor of the rivaling Qajars due to infighting between the Khan’s incompetent offspring  It wasn t until Lotf Ali Khan  10 years later  that the dynasty would once again be led by an adept ruler  By this time however  the Qajars had already progressed greatly  having taken a number of Zand territories  Lotf Ali Khan made multiple successes before ultimately succumbing to the rivaling faction  Iran and all its Kurdish territories would hereby be incorporated in the Qajar Dynasty   The Kurdish tribes present in Baluchistan and some of those in Fars are believed to be remnants of those that assisted and accompanied Lotf Ali Khan and Karim Khan  respectively   4 5  Ottoman period  When Sultan Selim I  after defeating Shah Ismail I in 1514  annexed Armenia and Kurdistan  he entrusted the organisation of the conquered territories to Idris  the historian  who was a Kurd of Bitlis  He divided the territory into sanjaks or districts  and  making no attempt to interfere with the principle of heredity  installed the local chiefs as governors  He also resettled the rich pastoral country between Erzerum and Erivan  which had lain in waste since the passage of Timur  with Kurds from the Hakkari and Bohtan districts   The Ottoman centralist policies in the beginning of the 19th century aimed to remove power from the principalities and localities  which directly affected the Kurdish emirs  Bedirhan Bey was the last emir of the Cizre Bohtan Emirate after initiating an uprising in 1847 against the Ottomans to protect the current structures of the Kurdish principalities  Although his uprising is not classified as a nationalist one  his children played significant roles in the emergence and the development of Kurdish nationalism through the next century   The first modern Kurdish nationalist movement emerged in 1880 with an uprising led by a Kurdish landowner and head of the powerful Shemdinan family  Sheik Ubeydullah  who demanded political autonomy or outright independence for Kurds as well as the recognition of a Kurdistan state without interference from Turkish or Persian authorities  The uprising against Qajar Persia and the Ottoman Empire was ultimately suppressed by the Ottomans and Ubeydullah  along with other notables  were exiled to Istanbul   4 6  20th century  Kurdish nationalism emerged after World War I with the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire which had historically successfully integrated  but not assimilated  the Kurds  through use of forced repression of Kurdish movements to gain independence  Revolts did occur sporadically but only in 1880 with the uprising led by Sheik Ubeydullah were demands as an ethnic group or nation made  Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid responded by a campaign of integration by co opting prominent Kurdish opponents to strong Ottoman power with prestigious positions in his government  This strategy appears successful given the loyalty displayed by the Kurdish Hamidiye regiments during World War I   The Kurdish ethnonationalist movement that emerged following World War I and end of the Ottoman Empire was largely reactionary to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey  primarily radical secularization which the strongly Muslim Kurds abhorred  centralization of authority which threatened the power of local chieftains and Kurdish autonomy  and rampant Turkish nationalism in the new Turkish Republic which obviously threatened to marginalize them   Jakob Künzler  head of a missionary hospital in Urfa  has documented the large scale ethnic cleansing of both Armenians and Kurds by the Young Turks  He has given a detailed account of deportation of Kurds from Erzurum and Bitlis in winter of 1916  The Kurds were perceived to be subversive elements that would take the Russian side in the war  In order to eliminate this threat  Young Turks embarked on a large scale deportation of Kurds from the regions of Djabachdjur  Palu  Musch  Erzurum and Bitlis  Around 300 000 Kurds were forced to move southwards to Urfa and then westwards to Aintab and Marasch  In the summer of 1917  Kurds were moved to Konya in central Anatolia  Through this measures  the Young Turk leaders aimed at eliminating the Kurds by deporting them from their ancestral lands and by dispersing them in small pockets of exiled communities  By the end of World War I  up to 700 000 Kurds were forcibly deported and almost half of the displaced perished   Some of the Kurdish groups sought self determination and the championing in the Treaty of Sèvres of Kurdish autonomy in the aftermath of World War I  Kemal Atatürk prevented such a result  Kurds backed by the United Kingdom declared independence in 1927 and established so called Republic of Ararat  Turkey suppressed Kurdist revolts in 1925  1930  and 1937–1938  while Iran did the same in the 1920s to Simko Shikak at Lake Urmia and Jaafar Sultan of Hewraman region who controlled the region between Marivan and north of Halabja  A short lived Soviet sponsored Kurdish Republic of Mahabad in Iran did not long outlast World War II   From 1922–1924 in Iraq a Kingdom of Kurdistan existed  When Ba athist administrators thwarted Kurdish nationalist ambitions in Iraq  war broke out in the 1960s  In 1970 the Kurds rejected limited territorial self rule within Iraq  demanding larger areas including the oil rich Kirkuk region   During the 1920s and 1930s  several large scale Kurdish revolts took place in Kurdistan Following these rebellions  the area of Turkish Kurdistan was put under martial law and a large number of the Kurds were displaced  Government also encouraged resettlement of Albanians from Kosovo and Assyrians in the region to change the population makeup  These events and measures led to a long lasting mutual distrust between Ankara and the Kurds   During the relatively open government of the 1950s  Kurds gained political office and started working within the framework of the Turkish Republic to further their interests but this move towards integration was halted with the 1960 Turkish coup d état  The 1970s saw an evolution in Kurdish nationalism as Marxist political thought influenced a new generation of Kurdish nationalists opposed to the local feudal authorities who had been a traditional source of opposition to authority  eventually they would form the militant separatist PKK 舑 listed as a terrorist organization by the United Nations  European Union  NATO and many states that includes United States   or Kurdistan Workers Party in English   Kurds are often regarded as  the largest ethnic group without a state   although larger stateless nations exist  Such periphrasis is rejected by leading Kurdologists like Martin van Bruinessen and other scholars who agree that claim obscures Kurdish cultural  social  political and ideological heterogeneity  Michael Radu argues such meaningless claims mostly come from Western human rights militants  leftists and Kurdish nationalists in Europe   5  Kurdish communities  5 1  Turkey  According to CIA Factbook  Kurds formed approximately 18% of the population in Turkey  approximately 14 million  in 2008  One Western source estimates that up to 25% of the Turkish population is Kurdish  approximately 18 19 million people   Kurdish sources claim there are as many as 20 or 25 million Kurds in Turkey  In 1980  Ethnologue estimated the number of Kurdish speakers in Turkey at around five million  when the country s population stood at 44 million  Kurds form the largest minority group in Turkey  and they have posed the most serious and persistent challenge to the official image of a homogeneous society  This classification was changed to the new euphemism of Eastern Turk in 1980   Several large scale Kurdish revolts in 1925  1930 and 1938 were suppressed by the Turkish government and more than one million Kurds were forcibly relocated between 1925 and 1938  The use of Kurdish language  dress  folklore  and names were banned and the Kurdish inhabited areas remained under martial law until 1946  The Ararat revolt  which reached its apex in 1930  was only suppressed after a massive military campaign including destruction of many villages and their populations  In quelling the revolt  Turkey was assisted by the close cooperation of its neighboring states such as Soviet Union  Iran and Iraq  The revolt was organized by a Kurdish party called Khoybun which signed a treaty with the Dashnaksutyun  Armenian Revolutionary Federation  in 1927  By the 1970s  Kurdish leftist organizations such as Kurdistan Socialist Party Turkey  KSP T  emerged in Turkey which were against violence and supported civil activities and participation in elections  In 1977  Mehdi Zana a supporter of KSP T won the mayoralty of Diyarbakir in the local elections  At about the same time  generational fissures gave birth to two new organizations  the National Liberation of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Workers Party   The Partiya Karkerên Kurdistan  PKK   also known as KADEK and Kongra Gel  is considered by the US  the EU  and NATO to be a terrorist organization  It is an ethnic secessionist organization using violence for the purpose of achieving its goal of creating an independent Kurdish state in parts of southeastern Turkey  northeastern Iraq  northeastern Syria and northwestern Iran   Between 1984 and 1999  the PKK and the Turkish military engaged in open war  and much of the countryside in the southeast was depopulated  as Kurdish civilians moved to local defensible centers such as Diyarbakır  Van  and Şırnak  as well as to the cities of western Turkey and even to western Europe  The causes of the depopulation included PKK atrocities against Kurdish clans they could not control  the poverty of the southeast  and the Turkish state s military operations  State actions also included forced inscription  forced evacuation  destruction of villages  severe harassment and extrajudicial executions   Leyla Zana  the first Kurdish female MP from Diyarbakir  caused an uproar in Turkish Parliament after adding the following sentence in Kurdish to her parliamentary oath during the swearing in ceremony in 1994   In March 1994  the Turkish Parliament voted to lift the immunity of Zana and five other Kurdish DEP members  Hatip Dicle  Ahmet Turk  Sirri Sakik  Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak  Zana  Dicle  Sadak and Dogan were sentenced to 15 years in jail by the Supreme Court in October 1995  Zana was awarded the Sakharov Prize for human rights by the European Parliament in 1995  She was released in 2004 amid warnings from European institutions that the continued imprisonment of the four Kurdish MPs would affect Turkey s bid to join the EU  The 2009 local elections resulted in 5 7% for Kurdish political party DTP   Officially protected death squads are accused of disappearance of 3 200 Kurds and Assyrians in 1993 and 1994 in the so called mystery killings  Kurdish politicians  human rights activists  journalists  teachers and other members of intelligentsia were among the victims  Virtually none of the perpetrators were investigated nor punished  Turkish government also encouraged Islamic extremist group Hezbollah to assassinate suspected PKK members and often ordinary Kurds  Azimet Köylüoğlu  the state minister of human rights  revealed the extent of security forces  excesses in autumn 1994  While acts of terrorism in other regions are done by the PKK  in Tunceli it is state terrorism  In Tunceli  it is the state that is evacuating and burning villages  In the southeast there are two million people left homeless   5 2  Iran  The Kurdish region of Iran has been a part of the country since ancient times  Nearly all Kurdistan was part of Iranian Empire until its Western part was lost during wars against the Ottoman Empire  Following dissolution of the Ottoman Empire  at Paris Conferences of 1919 Tehran has demanded all lost territories including Turkish Kurdistan  Mosul  and even Diyarbakır  but demands were quickly rejected by Western powers  This area has been divided by modern Turkey  Syria and Iraq  Today  the Kurds inhabit mostly north western territories known as Iranian Kurdistan but also north eastern region of Khorasan  and constitute approximately 7 10% of Iran s overall population  6 5–7 9 million   comparing to 10 6%  2 million  in 1956 or 8%  800 thousand  in 1850   Unlike in other Kurdish populated countries  there are strong ethnolinguistical and cultural ties between Kurds  Persians and others as Iranian peoples  Some of modern Iranian dynasties like Safavids and Zands are considered to be partly of Kurdish origin  Kurdish literature in all of its forms  Kurmanji  Sorani and Gorani  has been developed within historical Iranian boundaries under strong influence of Persian language  Fact that Kurds share much of their history with the rest of Iran is seen as reason why Kurdish leaders in Iran do not want a separate Kurdish state  The government of Iran has never employed the same level of brutality against its own Kurds like Turkey or Iraq  but it has always been implacably opposed to any suggestion of Kurdish separatism  During and shortly after First World War the government of Iran was ineffective and had very little control over events in the country and several Kurdish tribal chiefs gained local political power  even established large confederations  In the same time  wave of nationalism from disintegrating Ottoman Empire has partly influenced some Kurdish chiefs in border region  and they posed as Kurdish nationalist leaders  Prior to this  identity in both countries largely relied upon religion i e  Shia Islam in the particular case of Iran  In 19th century Iran  Shia–Sunni animosity and describing Sunni Kurds as Ottoman fifth column was quite frenquent   During the late 1910s and early 1920s  tribal revolt led by Kurdish chieftain Simko Shikak struck north western Iran  Although elements of Kurdish nationalism were present in this movement  historians agree these were hardly articulate enough to justify a claim that recognition of Kurdish identity was a major issue in Simko s movement  and he had to rely heavily on conventional tribal motives  Government forces and non Kurds were not the only ones to suffer in the attacks  the Kurdish population was also robbed and assaulted  Rebels do not appear to have felt any sense of unity or solidarity with fellow Kurds  Kurdish insurgency and seasonal migrations in the late 1920s  along with long running tensions between Tehran and Ankara  resulted in border clashes and even military penetrations in both Iranian and Turkish territory  Two regional powers have used Kurdish tribes as tool for own political benefits  Turkey has provided military help and refuge for anti Iranian Turcophone Shikak rebels in 1918 1922  while Iran did the same during Ararat rebellion against Turkey in 1930  Reza Shah s military victory over Kurdish and Turkic tribal leaders initiaded with repressive era toward non Iranian minorities  Government s forced detribalization and sedentarization in 1920 s and 1930 s resulted with many other tribal revolts in Iranian regions of Azerbaijan  Luristan and Kurdistan  In particular case of the Kurds  this repressive policies partly contributed to developing nationalism among some tribes   As a response to growing Pan Turkism and Pan Arabism in region which were seen as potential threats to the territorial integrity of Iran  Pan Iranist ideology has been developed in the early 1920s  Some of such groups and journals openly advocated Iranian support to the Kurdish rebellion against Turkey  Secular Pahlavi dynasty has endorsed Iranian ethnic nationalism which seen the Kurds as integral part of the Iranian nation  Mohammad Reza Pahlavi has personally praised the Kurds as  pure Iranians  or  one of the most noble Iranian peoples   Another significant ideology during this period was Marxism which arose among Kurds under influence of USSR  It culminated in the Iran crisis of 1946 which included a separatist attempt of KDP I and communist groups to establish the Soviet puppet government called Republic of Mahabad  It arose along with Azerbaijan People s Government  another Soviet puppet state  The state itself encompassed a very small territory  including Mahabad and the adjacent cities  unable to incorporate the southern Iranian Kurdistan which fell inside the Anglo American zone  and unable to attract the tribes outside Mahabad itself to the nationalist cause  As a result  when the Soviets withdrew from Iran in December 1946  government forces were able to enter Mahabad unopposed  Several Marxist insurgencies continued for decades  1967  1979  1989–96  led by KDP I and Komalah  but those two organization have never advocated a separate Kurdish state or greater Kurdistan as did the PKK in Turkey  Still  many of dissident leaders  among others Qazi Muhammad and Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou  were executed or assassinated  During Iran–Iraq War  Tehran has provided support for Iraqi based Kurdish groups like KDP or PUK  along with asylum for 1 400 000 Iraqi refugees  mostly Kurds  Although Kurdish Marxist groups have been marginalized in Iran since the dissolution of the Soviet Union  in 2004 new insurrection has been started by PJAK  separatist organization affiliated with the Turkey based PKK and designated as terrorist by Iran  Turkey and the USA  Some analysts claim PJAK do not pose any serious threat to the government of Iran  Cease fire has been established on September 2011 following the Iranian offensive on PJAK bases  but several clashes between PJAK and IRGC took place after it  Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979  accusations of  discrimination  by Western organizations and of  foreign involvement  by Iranian side have become very frequent   Kurds have been well integrated in Iranian political life during reign of various governments  Kurdish liberal political Karim Sanjabi has served as minister of education under Mohammad Mossadegh in 1952  During the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi some members of parliament and high army officers were Kurds  and there was even a Kurdish Cabinet Minister  During the reign of the Pahlavis Kurds received many favours from the authorities  for instance to keep their land after the land reforms of 1962  In the early 2000s  presence of thirty Kurdish deputies in the 290 strong parliament has also helped to undermine claims of discrimination  Some of influential Kurdish politicians during recent years include former first vice president Mohammad Reza Rahimi and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf  Mayor of Tehran and second placed presidential candidate in 2013  Kurdish language is today used more than at any other time since the Revolution  including in several newspapers and among schoolchildren  Large number of Kurds in Iran show no interest in Kurdish nationalism  especially Shia Kurds who even vigorously reject idea of autonomy  preferring direct rule from Tehran  Iranian national identity is questioned only in the peripheral Kurdish Sunni regions   5 3  Iraq  Kurds constitute approximately 17% of Iraq s population  They are the majority in at least three provinces in northern Iraq which are together known as Iraqi Kurdistan  Kurds also have a presence in Kirkuk  Mosul  Khanaqin  and Baghdad  Around 300 000 Kurds live in the Iraqi capital Baghdad  50 000 in the city of Mosul and around 100 000 elsewhere in southern Iraq   Kurds led by Mustafa Barzani were engaged in heavy fighting against successive Iraqi regimes from 1960 to 1975  In March 1970  Iraq announced a peace plan providing for Kurdish autonomy  The plan was to be implemented in four years  However  at the same time  the Iraqi regime started an Arabization program in the oil rich regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin  The peace agreement did not last long  and in 1974  the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurds  Moreover in March 1975  Iraq and Iran signed the Algiers Accord  according to which Iran cut supplies to Iraqi Kurds  Iraq started another wave of Arabization by moving Arabs to the oil fields in Kurdistan  particularly those around Kirkuk  Between 1975 and 1978  200 000 Kurds were deported to other parts of Iraq   During the Iran Iraq War in the 1980s  the regime implemented anti Kurdish policies and a de facto civil war broke out  Iraq was widely condemned by the international community  but was never seriously punished for oppressive measures such as the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians  the wholesale destruction of thousands of villages and the deportation of thousands of Kurds to southern and central Iraq   The genocidal campaign  conducted between 1986 and 1989 and culminating in 1988  carried out by the Iraqi government against the Kurdish population was called Anfal   Spoils of War    The Anfal campaign led to destruction of over two thousand villages and killing of 182 000 Kurdish civilians  The campaign included the use of ground offensives  aerial bombing  systematic destruction of settlements  mass deportation  firing squads  and chemical attacks  including the most infamous attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988 that killed 5000 civilians instantly   After the collapse of the Kurdish uprising in March 1991  Iraqi troops recaptured most of the Kurdish areas and 1 5 million Kurds abandoned their homes and fled to the Turkish and Iranian borders  It is estimated that close to 20 000 Kurds succumbed to death due to exhaustion  lack of food  exposure to cold and disease  On 5 April 1991  UN Security Council passed resolution 688 which condemned the repression of Iraqi Kurdish civilians and demanded that Iraq end its repressive measures and allow immediate access to international humanitarian organizations  This was the first international document  since the League of Nations arbitration of Mosul in 1926  to mention Kurds by name  In mid April  the Coalition established safe havens inside Iraqi borders and prohibited Iraqi planes from flying north of 36th parallel  In October 1991  Kurdish guerrillas captured Erbil and Sulaimaniyah after a series of clashes with Iraqi troops  In late October  Iraqi government retaliated by imposing a food and fuel embargo on the Kurds and stopping to pay civil servants in the Kurdish region  The embargo  however  backfired and Kurds held parliamentary elections in May 1992 and established Kurdistan Regional Government  KRG    The Kurdish population welcomed the American troops in 2003 by holding celebrations and dancing in the streets  The area controlled by peshmerga was expanded  and Kurds now have effective control in Kirkuk and parts of Mosul  The authority of the KRG and legality of its laws and regulations were recognized in the articles 113 and 137 of the new Iraqi Constitution ratified in 2005  By the beginning of 2006  the two Kurdish administrations of Erbil and Sulaimaniya were unified  On August 14  2007 Yazidis were targeted in a series of bombings that became the deadliest suicide attack since the Iraq War began  killing 796 civilians  wounding 1 562   5 4  Syria  Kurds account for 9% of Syria s population  a total of around 1 6 million people  This makes them the largest ethnic minority in the country  They are mostly concentrated in the northeast and the north  but there are also significant Kurdish populations in Aleppo and Damascus  Kurds often speak Kurdish in public  unless all those present do not  According to Amnesty International  Kurdish human rights activists are mistreated and persecuted  No political parties are allowed for any group  Kurdish or otherwise   Techniques used to suppress the ethnic identity of Kurds in Syria include various bans on the use of the Kurdish language  refusal to register children with Kurdish names  the replacement of Kurdish place names with new names in Arabic  the prohibition of businesses that do not have Arabic names  the prohibition of Kurdish private schools  and the prohibition of books and other materials written in Kurdish  Having been denied the right to Syrian nationality  around 300 000 Kurds have been deprived of any social rights  in violation of international law  As a consequence  these Kurds are in effect trapped within Syria  In March 2011  in part to avoid further demonstrations and unrest from spreading across Syria  the Syrian government promised to tackle the issue and grant Syrian citizenship to approximately 300 000 Kurds who had been previously denied the right   On March 12  2004  beginning at a stadium in Qamishli  a largely Kurdish city in northeastern Syria   clashes between Kurds and Syrians broke out and continued over a number of days  At least thirty people were killed and more than 160 injured  The unrest spread to other Kurdish towns along the northern border with Turkey  and then to Damascus and Aleppo   As a result of Syrian civil war  since July 2012  Kurds were able to take control of large parts of Syrian Kurdistan from Andiwar in extreme northeast to Jindires in extreme northwest Syria   5 5  Transcaucasus  Between the 1930s and 1980s  Armenia was a part of the Soviet Union  within which Kurds  like other ethnic groups  had the status of a protected minority  Armenian Kurds were permitted their own state sponsored newspaper  radio broadcasts and cultural events  During the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh  many non Yazidi Kurds were forced to leave their homes since both the Azeri and non Yazidi Kurds were Muslim   In 1920  two Kurdish inhabited areas of Jewanshir  capital Kalbajar  and eastern Zangazur  capital Lachin  were combined to form the Kurdistan Okrug  or  Red Kurdistan    The period of existence of the Kurdish administrative unit was brief and did not last beyond 1929  Kurds subsequently faced many repressive measures  including deportations  imposed by the Soviet government  As a result of the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh  many Kurdish areas have been destroyed and more than 150 000 Kurds have been deported since 1988 by separatist Armenian forces   5 6  Diaspora  According to a report by the Council of Europe  approximately 1 3 million Kurds live in Western Europe  The earliest immigrants were Kurds from Turkey  who settled in Germany  Austria  the Benelux countries  Great Britain  Switzerland and France during the 1960s  Successive periods of political and social turmoil in the region during the 1980s and 1990s brought new waves of Kurdish refugees  mostly from Iran and Iraq under Saddam Hussein  came to Europe  In recent years  many Kurdish asylum seekers from both Iran and Iraq have settled in the United Kingdom  especially in the town of Dewsbury and in some northern areas of London   which has sometimes caused media controversy over their right to remain  There have been tensions between Kurds and the established Muslim community in Dewsbury  which is home to very traditional mosques such as the Markazi  There was substantial immigration of Kurds into North America  who are mainly political refugees and immigrants seeking economic opportunity  Kurdish immigrants started to settle in large numbers in Nashville in 1976  which is now home to the largest Kurdish community in the United States and is nicknamed Little Kurdistan  Kurdish population in Nashville is estimated to be around 11 000  Total number of ethnic Kurds residing in the United States is estimated by the U S  Census Bureau to be around 15 000  According to the 2006 Canadian Census  there were over 9 000 people of Kurdish ethnic background living in Canada and according to the 2011 Census  more than 10 000 Canadians spoke Kurdish language   6  Religion  As a whole  the Kurdish people are adherents to a large number of different religions and creeds  perhaps constituting the most religiously diverse people of West Asia  Traditionally  Kurds have been known to take great liberties with their practices  This sentiment is reflected in the saying  Compared to the unbeliever  the Kurd is a Muslim    6 1  Islam  Today  the majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslim  belonging to the Shafi school   There is also a minority of Kurds who are Shia Muslims  primarily living in the Ilam and Kermanshah provinces of Iran  Central and south eastern Iraq  Fayli Kurds   Mystical practices and participation in Sufi orders are also widespread among Kurds   The Alevis  usually considered adherents of a branch of Shia Islam with elements of Sufism  are another religious minority among the Kurds  living in Eastern Anatolia  Alevism developed out of the teachings of Haji Bektash Veli  a 13th century mystic from Khorasan  Among the Qizilbash  the militant groups which predate the Alevis and helped establish the Safavid Dynasty  there were numerous Kurdish tribes  The American missionary Stephen van Renssalaer Trowbridge  working at Aintab  present Gaziantep  reported that his Alevi acquaintances considered as their highest spiritual leaders an Ahl i Haqq sayyid family in the Guran district   6 2  Ahl i Haqq  Yarsan   Ahl i Haqq or Yarsanism is a syncretic religion founded by Sultan Sahak in the late 14th century in western Iran  Most of its adherents  totaling around 1 million  are Kurds  Its central religious text is the Kalâm e Saranjâm  written in Gurani  In this text  the religion s basic pillars are summarized as   The Yarsan should strive for these four qualities  purity  rectitude  self effacement and self abnegation    The Yarsan faith s unique features include millenarism  nativism  egalitarianism  metempsychosis  angelology  divine manifestation and dualism  Many of these features are found in Yazidism  another Kurdish faith  in the faith of Zoroastrians and in ghulat  non mainstream Shia  groups  certainly  the names and religious terminology of the Yarsan are often explicitly of Muslim origin  Unlike other indigenous Persianate faiths  the Yarsan explicitly reject class  caste and rank  which sets them apart from the Yazidis and Zoroastrians   The Ahl i Haqq consider the Bektashi and Alevi as kindred communities   6 3  Yazidis  Yazidism is another syncretic religion practiced among Kurdish communities  founded by Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir  an 12th century mystic from Lebanon  Their numbers exceed 500 000  Its central religious texts are the Kitêba Cilwe and Meshaf Resh  According to Yazidi beliefs  God created the world but left it in the care of a heptad of holy beings or angels  The most prominent angel is Melek Taus  Kurdish  Tawûsê Melek   the Peacock Angel  God s representative on earth  Yazidis believe in the periodic reincarnation of the seven holy beings in human form   Their holiest shrine and the tomb of the faith s founder is located in Lalish  in northern Iraq   6 4  Zoroastrianism  Presently  there are a small number of Zoroastrian Kurds  most of which are recent converts  These communities have established new temples and have been attempting to recruit new members to their faith  The Kurdish philosopher Sohrevardi drew heavily from Zoroastrian teachings   6 5  Judaism  Judaism is still practised in very small numbers across Kurdistan  There are however some 200 000 Kurdish Jews  residing in Israel  The Jews of Kurdistan migrated to Palestine during the previous centuries but the overwhelming majority of the Kurdish Jews had fled to Israel together with Iraqi Jews in Operation Ezra and Nehemiah during 1950–1952   The Jews of Kurdistan are thought to be the descendants of those Jews that were deported from Israel by the Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BC  These later formed the Kingdom of Adiabene  and  after fading into obscurity in centuries thereafter  reappeared in the Middle Ages  where multiple accounts of them were made  One such account details the story of David Alroy  a Jewish leader from Amadiyah in the 12th century  who revolted against the Persian rulers and was bent on recapturing Jerusalem   For centuries thereafter  the Jews had lived as protected subjects of the Kurdish tribal chieftains  aghas  and survived in the urban centers and villages in which they lived  According to Mordechai Zaken  the Kurdistani Jews had managed to survive by supporting their tribal chieftains and village aghas in times of need and through financial contributions  occasional gifts  variety of services as well as taxes and dues in the form of commissions of their commercial and agricultural transactions  In return  the tribal Kurdish aghas would protect their Jewish subjects and grant them patronage in the tribal arena  Indeed  some wealthy Jewish merchants and community leaders had to deal at times with aghas who coveted their vineyards or other material goods and satisfy their needs and fulfil their desire  However  in his research  Zaken points out that there was a kind of tribal tradition  passed on from father to son  to keep and protect the Jewish subjects in the village  at times one or two Jewish families in one village  or the tribal arena  Even though the ancestral origins  as well as the mother tongue of the Kurdish Jews is different from the main Kurdish populace  the vast majority regard themselves as Kurds   6 6  Christianity  Although historically there have been various accounts of Kurdish Christians  most often these were in the form of individuals  and not as communities  However  in the 19th and 20th century various travel logs tell of Kurdish Christian tribes  as well as Kurdish Muslim tribes who had substantial Christan populations living amongst them  A significant number of these were allegedly originally Armenian or Assyrian  and it has been recorded that a small number of Christian traditions have been preserved  Several Christian prayers in Kurdish have been found from earlier centuries   However  most contemporary Kurdish Christians are recent converts  Both among Turkish and Iraqi Kurds there have been an increasing number of Kurds converting to Christianity  Some communities of the Iraqi converts have formed their own evangelical churches  Prominent historical Kurdish Christians include Theophobos and the brothers Zakare and Ivane   7  Culture  Kurdish culture is a legacy from the various ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society  As most other Middle Eastern populations  a high degree of mutual influences between the Kurds and their neighbouring peoples are apparent  Therefore  in Kurdish culture elements of various other cultures are to be seen  However  on the whole  Kurdish culture is closest to that of other Iranian peoples  in particular those who historically had the closest geographical proximity to the Kurds  such as the Persians and Lurs  Kurds  for instance  also celebrate Newroz  March 21  as New Year s Day   7 1  Women  Kurdish men and women participate in mixed gender dancing during feasts  weddings and other social celebrations  Major Soane  a British colonial officer during World War I  noted that this is unusual among Islamic people and pointed out that in this respect Kurdish culture is more akin to that of eastern Europe than to their West Asian counterparts   7 2  Folklore and Mythology  The Kurds possess a rich tradition of folklore  which  until recent times  was largely transmitted by speech or song  from one generation to the next  Although some of the Kurdish writers’ stories were well known throughout Kurdistan  most of the stories told and sung were only written down in the 20th and 21st century  Many of these are  allegedly  centuries old   Widely varying in purpose and style  among the Kurdish folklore one will find stories about nature  anthropomorphic animals  love  heroes and villains  mythological creatures and everyday life  A number of these mythological figures can be found in other cultures  like the Simurgh and Kaveh the Blacksmith in the broader Iranian Mythology  and stories of Shahmaran throughout Anatolia  Additionally  stories can be purely entertaining  or have an educational or religious aspect   Perhaps the most widely reoccurring element is the fox  which  through cunningness and shrewdness triumphs over less intelligent species  yet often also meets his demise  Another common theme are the origins of a tribe   Storytellers would perform in front of an audience  sometimes consisting of an entire village  People from outside the region would travel to attend their narratives  and the storytellers themselves would visit other villages to spread their tales  These would thrive especially during winter  where entertainment was hard to find as evenings had to be spent inside   Coinciding with the heterogeneous Kurdish groupings  although certain stories and elements were commonly found throughout Kurdistan  others were unique to a specific area  depending on the region  religion or dialect  The Kurdish Jews of Zakho are perhaps the best example of this  whose gifted storytellers are known to have been greatly respected throughout the region  thanks to a unique oral tradition  Other examples are the mythology of the Yezidis  and the stories of the Dersim Kurds  which had a substantial Armenian influence   During the criminalization of the Kurdish language after the coup d’état of 1980  dengbêj  singers  and çîrokbêj  tellers  were silenced  and many of the stories had become endangered  In 1991  the language was decriminalized  yet the now highly available radios and TV’s had as effect a diminished interest in traditional storytelling  However  a number of writers have made great strides in the preservation of these tales   7 3  Weaving  Kurdish weaving is renowned throughout the world  with fine specimens of both rugs and bags  The most famous Kurdish rugs are those from the Bijar region  in the Kurdistan Province  Because of the unique way in which the Bijar rugs are woven  they are very stout and durable  hence their appellation as the ‘Iron Rugs of Persia’  Exhibiting a wide variety  the Bijar rugs have patterns ranging from floral designs  medallions and animals to other ornaments  They generally have two wefts  and are very colorful in design  With an increased interest in these rugs in the last century  and a lesser need for them to be as sturdy as they were  new Bijar rugs are more refined and delicate in design   Another well known Kurdish rug is the Senneh rug  which is regarded as the most sophisticated of the Kurdish rugs  They are especially known for their great knot density and high quality mountain wool  They lend their name from the region of Sanandaj  Throughout other Kurdish regions like Kermanshah  Siirt  Malatya and Bitlis rugs were also woven to great extent   Kurdish bags are mainly known from the works of one large tribe  the Jaffs  living in the border area between Iran and Iraq  These Jaff bags share the same characteristics of Kurdish rugs  very colorful  stout in design  often with medallion patterns  They were especially popular in the West during the 1920s and 1930s   7 4  Handicrafts  Outside of weaving and clothing  there are many other Kurdish handicrafts  which were traditionally often crafted by nomadic Kurdish tribes  These are especially well known in Iran  most notably the crafts from the Kermanshah and Sanandaj regions  Among these crafts are chess boards  talismans  jewelry  ornaments  weaponry  instruments etc   Kurdish blades include a distinct jambiya  with its characteristic I shaped hilt  and oblong blade  Generally  these possess double edged blades  reinforced with a central ridge  a wooden  leather or silver decorated scabbard  and a horn hilt  furthermore they are often still worn decoratively by older men  Swords were made as well  Most of these blades in curcilation stem from the 19th century   Another distinct form of art from Sanandaj is  Oroosi   a type of window where stylized wooden pieces are locked into each other  rather than being glued together  These are further decorated with coloured glass  this stems from an old belief that if light passes through a combination of seven colours it helps keep the atmosphere clean   Among Kurdish Jews a common practice was the making of talismans  which were believed to combat illnesses and protect the wearer from malevolent spirits   7 5  Tattoos  Adorning the body with tattoos  Deq in Kurdish  is widespread among the Kurds  even though permanent tattoos are not permissible in Sunni Islam  Therefore  these traditional tattoos are thought to derive from pre Islamic times   Tattoo ink is made by mixing soot with  breast  milk and the poisonous liquid from the gall bladder of an animal  The design is drawn on the skin using a thin twig and is  by needle  penetrated under the skin  These have a wide variety of meanings and purposes  among which are protection against evil or illnesses  beauty enhancement  and the showing of tribal affiliations  Religious symbolism is also common among both traditional and modern Kurdish tattoos  Tattoos are more prevalent among women than among men  and were generally worn on feet  the chin  foreheads and other places of the body   The popularity of permanent  traditional tattoos has greatly diminished among newer generation of Kurds  However  modern tattoos are becoming more prevalent  and temporary tattoos are still being worn on special occasions  such as henna  the night before a wedding  and as tribute to the cultural heritage   7 6  Music and dance  Traditionally  there are three types of Kurdish classical performers  storytellers  çîrokbêj   minstrels  stranbêj   and bards  dengbêj   No specific music was associated with the Kurdish princely courts  Instead  music performed in night gatherings  şevbihêrk  is considered classical  Several musical forms are found in this genre  Many songs are epic in nature  such as the popular Lawiks  heroic ballads recounting the tales of Kurdish heroes such as Saladin  Heyrans are love ballads usually expressing the melancholy of separation and unfulfilled love  one of the first Kurdish female singers to sing heyrans is Chopy Fatah  while Lawje is a form of religious music and Payizoks are songs performed during the autumn  Love songs  dance music  wedding and other celebratory songs  dîlok narînk   erotic poetry  and work songs are also popular   Throughout the Middle East  there are many prominent Kurdish artists  Most famous are Ibrahim Tatlises  Nizamettin Arıç  Ahmet Kaya and the Kamkars  In Europe  well known artists are Darin Zanyar  Sivan Perwer  and Azad   7 7  Cinema  The main themes of Kurdish films are the poverty and hardship which ordinary Kurds have to endure  The first films featuring Kurdish culture were actually shot in Armenia  Zare  released in 1927  produced by Hamo Beknazarian  details the story of Zare and her love for the shepherd Seydo  and the difficulties the two experience by the hand of the village elder  In 1948 and 1959  two documentaries were made concerning the Yezidi Kurds in Armenia  These were joint Armenian Kurdish productions  with H  Koçaryan and Heciye Cindi teaming up for The Kurds of Soviet Armenia  and Ereb Samilov and C  Jamharyan for Kurds of Armenia   The first critically acclaimed and famous Kurdish films were produced by Yılmaz Güney  Initially a popular  award winning actor in Turkey with the nickname Çirkin Kral  the Ugly King  after his rough looks   he spent the later part of his career producing socio critical and politically loaded films  Sürü  1979   Yol  1982  and Duvar  1983  are his best known works  of which the second won Palme d Or at the Cannes Film Festival of 1982  the most prestigious award in the world of cinema   Another prominent Kurdish film director is Bahman Qubadi  His first feature film was A Time for Drunken Horses  released in 2000  It was critically acclaimed  and went on to win multiple awards  Other movies of his would follow this example  making him one of the best known film producers of Iran of today  Recently  he released Rhinos Season  starring Behrouz Vossoughi  Monica Bellucci and Yilmaz Erdogan  detailing the tumultuous life of a Kurdish poet   Other prominent Kurdish film directors are Mahsun Kırmızıgül  Hiner Saleem and before mentioned Yilmaz Erdogan  There’s also been a number of films set and or filmed in Kurdistan made by non Kurdish film directors  such as the Wind Will Carry Us  Triage  The Exorcist  The Market  A Tale of Trade  and    7 8  Sports  The most popular sport among the Kurds is football  Because the Kurds have no independent state  they have no representative team in FIFA or the AFC  however a team representing Iraqi Kurdistan has been active in the Viva World Cup since 2008  They became runners up in 2009 and 2010  before ultimately becoming champion in 2012   On a national level  the Kurdish clubs of Iraq have achieved success in recent years as well  winning the Iraqi Premier League four times in the last five years  Prominent clubs are Erbil SC  Duhok SC  Sulaymaniyah FC and Zakho FC   In Turkey  a Kurd named Celal Ibrahim was one of the founders of Galatasaray S K  in 1905  as well as one of the original players  The most prominent Kurdish Turkish club is Diyarbakirspor  In the diaspora  the most successful Kurdish club is Dalkurd FF and the most famous player is Eren Derdiyok   Another prominent sport is wrestling  In Iranian Wrestling  there are three styles originating from Kurdish regions   Zhir o Bal  a style similar to Greco Roman wrestling   practised in Kordestan  Kermanshah and Ilam   Zouran Patouleh  practised in Kordestan   Zouran Machkeh  practised in Kordestan as well  Furthermore  the most accredited of the traditional Iranian wrestling styles  the Bachoukheh  derives its name from a local Khorasani Kurdish costume in which it is practiced   Kurdish medalists in the 2012 Summer Olympics were Nur Tatar  Kianoush Rostami and Yezidi Misha Aloyan  who won medals in taekwondo  weightlifting and boxing  respectively   7 9  Architecture  The traditional Kurdish village has simple houses  made of mud  In most cases with flat  wooden roofs  and  if the village is built on the slope of a mountain  the roof on one house makes for the garden of the house one level higher  However  houses with a beehive like roof  not unlike those in Harran  are also present   Over the centuries many Kurdish architectural marvels have been erected  with varying styles  Kurdistan boasts many examples from ancient Iranic  Roman  Greek and Semitic origin  most famous of these include Bisotun and Taq e Bostan in Kermanshah  Takht e Soleyman near Takab  Mount Nemrud near Adiyaman and the citadels of Erbil and Diyarbakir   The first genuinely Kurdish examples extant were built in the 11th century  Those earliest examples consist of the Marwanid Dicle Bridge in Diyarbakir  the Shadaddid Minuchir Mosque in Ani  and the Hisn al Akrad near Homs   In the 12th and 13th centuries the Ayyubid dynasty constructed many buildings throughout the Middle East  being influenced by their predecessors  the Fatimids  and their rivals  the Crusaders  whilst also developing their own techniques  Furthermore  women of the Ayyubid family took a prominent role in the patronage of new constructions  The Ayyubids’ most famous works are the Halil ur Rahman Mosque that surrounds the Pool of Sacred Fish in Urfa  the Citadel of Cairo and most parts of the Citadel of Aleppo  Another important piece of Kurdish architectural heritage from the late 12th early 13th century is the Yezidi pilgrimage site Lalish  with its trademark conical roofs   In later periods too  Kurdish rulers and their corresponding dynasties and emirates would leave their mark upon the land in the form mosques  castles and bridges  some of which have decayed  or have been  partly  destroyed in an attempt to erase the Kurdish cultural heritage  such as the White Castle of the Bohtan Emirate  Well known examples are Hosap Castle of the 17th century  Sherwana Castle of the early 18th century  and the Ellwen Bridge of Khanaqin of the 19th century   Most famous is the Ishak Pasha Palace of Dogubeyazit  a structure with heavy influences from both Anatolian and Iranic architectural traditions  Construction of the Palace began in 1685  led by Colak Abdi Pasha  a Kurdish bey of the Ottoman Empire  but the building wouldn’t be completed until 1784  by his grandson  Ishak Pasha  Containing almost 100 rooms  including a mosque  dining rooms  dungeons and being heavily decorated by hewn out ornaments  this Palace has the reputation as being one of the finest pieces of architecture of the Ottoman Period  and of Anatolia   In recent years  the KRG has been responsible for the renovation of several historical structures  such as Erbil Citadel and the Mudhafaria Minaret   8  Gallery  File Kurdish man on horseback 1974 jpg Kurdish man on horseback
