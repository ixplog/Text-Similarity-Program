Japheth      Modern Hebrew      or     is one of the sons of Noah in the Abrahamic tradition  In Arabic citations  his name is normally given as Yafeth bin Nuh   Japheth  son of Noah     In Biblical as well as Quranic tradition  Japheth is considered to be the progenitor of Eurasian Peoples  The tribes Gog and Magog are also regarded as descendants of Japheth   1  Order of birth  Japheth is often regarded as the youngest son of Noah  though some traditions regard him as the eldest  They are listed in the order  Shem  Ham  and Japheth  in Genesis 5 32  9 18 and 10 1  but treated in the reverse order in the remainder of chapter 10   Genesis 10 21 refers to relative ages of Japheth and his brother Shem  but with sufficient ambiguity to have given rise to different translations  The verse is translated in the King James Version as follows   Unto Shem also  the father of all the children of Eber  the brother of Japheth the elder  even to him were children born   However  the Revised Standard Version reads   To Shem also  the father of all the children of Eber  the elder brother of Japheth  children were born   The differing interpretations depend on whether the Hebrew word ha gadol   the elder   is taken as grammatically referring to Japheth  or Shem   Genesis 5 32 states that Noah had three sons when he was five hundred years old  Genesis 11 10 records that Shem was one hundred years old when his son Arphaxad was born  two years after the Flood  If Noah was six hundred years old  Genesis 7 13   then Shem was ninety eight years old at the Flood  Ham is further implied to be the middle son in Gen  9 24  which says Noah realized what his  younger son  had done to him    The Book of Jubilees indicates in 4 33 that Shem was born in the year of the world  viz   after creation  1205  Ham in 1209  and Japheth in 1211   2  Place in Noah s family  For those who take the genealogies of Genesis to be historically accurate  Japheth is commonly believed to be the father of Europeans  The link between Japheth and the Europeans stems from Genesis 10 5  which states   According to that book  Japheth and his two brothers formed the three major races   Japheth is the father of the Japhetic race  Shem is the father of the Semitic race  Ham is the father of the Hamitic race William Shakespeare s play Henry IV  Part II contains a wry comment about people who claim to be related to royal families  Prince Hal notes of such people   Genesis 10 5 was often interpreted to mean that the peoples of Europe were descended from Japheth  Clearly  then  any two Englishmen must have at least this one ancestor in common  and thus any individual could claim kinship with the king   3  Descendants  In the Bible  Japheth is ascribed seven sons  Gomer  Magog  Tiras  Javan  Meshech  Tubal  and Madai  According to Josephus  Antiquities of the Jews I 6    Josephus subsequently detailed the nations supposed to have descended from the seven sons of Japheth   The  Book of Jasher   published in the 17th century  provides some new names for Japheth s grandchildren not found in the Bible or any other source  and provided a much more detailed genealogy  see Japhetic    3 1  Europeans  In the seventh century  Isidore of Seville published his noted history  in which he traces the origins of most of the nations of Europe back to Japheth  Scholars in almost every European nation continued to repeat and improve upon Saint Isidore s assertion of descent from Noah through Japheth into the nineteenth century   Ivane Javakhishvili associated Japheth s sons with certain ancient tribes  called Tubals  Tabals  Greek  Tibarenoi  and Meshechs  Meshekhs Mosokhs  Greek  Moschoi   who they claim represent non Indo European and non Semitic  possibly  Proto Iberian  tribes of Asia Minor of the 3rd 1st millennia BC   In the Polish tradition of Sarmatism  the Sarmatians were said to be descended from Japheth  son of Noah  enabling the Polish nobility to imagine themselves able to trace their ancestry directly to Noah   In Scotland  histories tracing the Scottish people to Japheth were published as late as George Chalmers  well received Caledonia  published in 3 volumes from 1807 to 1824   4  Language  The term  Japhetic  was also applied by William Jones and other early linguists to what became known as the Indo European language group  In a different sense  it was also used by the Soviet linguist Nikolai Marr in his Japhetic theory   5  In Islamic tradition  Japheth is not mentioned by name in the Qur an but is referred to indirectly in the narrative of Noah  VII  64  X  73  XI  40  XXIII  27  XXVI  119   Muslim exegesis  however  names all of Noah s sons  and these include Japheth  In identifying Japheth s descendants  Muslim exegesis more or less agrees with the Biblical traditions  He is usually regarded as the ancestor of the Gog and Magog tribes  and  at times  of the Turks  Khazars  and Slavs  Some traditions narrated that 36 languages of the world could be traced back to Japheth   6  Proposed correlations with deities  In the 19th century  Biblical syncretists associated the sons of Noah with ancient pagan gods   Japheth has been identified by some scholars with figures from other religious systems and mythologies  including Iapetus  Japetus   the Greek Titan  the Indian figures Dyaus Pitar and Pra Japati   and the Roman Iu Pater or  Father Jove   which became Jupiter   7  Arts and literature  Japheth is a major character in the Madeleine L Engle novel Many Waters  1986  ISBN 0 374 34796 4   He is characterized as thoughtful and intelligent  a kind hearted young man who is on good terms with feuding family members Noah and Lamech  with the seraphim  and with visiting time travelers Sandy and Dennys Murry  Depicted in the book as Noah s younger son  Japheth is barely into adulthood  but at Noah s instigation is already married  His equally kind wife is an unusually fair skinned woman with black hair  who may have been sired by one of the nephilim   Japheth is a major character in Stephen Schwartz s musical Children of Eden  In this adaptation  Japheth has fallen in love with the family servant girl  Yonah  and wants to bring her onto the Ark to survive the flood  but is forbidden because Yonah is descended from Cain  He manages to sneak her onto the Ark  and stands by her when she is discovered by the family  However  Noah goes against God and marries them  Upon the flood ending  Japheth and Yonah decide that the land they want to settle in will be Eden  even if they have to search their whole lives for it  Noah gives Japheth his blessing by giving him the staff of Adam  which Adam carved from the destroyed Tree of Knowledge and was passed down through his generations  to plant in Eden when they find it  Smaller productions of the American version have the actor cast as Cain doubling as Japheth   8  See also  Caucasian race  Japhetic  Mongoloid race  Proto Indo
