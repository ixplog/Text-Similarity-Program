Lisbon        is the capital and the largest city of Portugal  It is the westernmost large city located in continental Europe  as well as its westernmost capital city and the only one along the Atlantic coast  Lisbon lies in the western Iberian Peninsula on the Atlantic Ocean and the River Tagus  and has a population of 552 700  2011 census  in an area of 100 05 km²  The urban area extends beyond the administrative city limits with an estimated population of 2 7 million  on an area of   making it the 11th most populous urban area in the European Union  About 3 035 000 people live in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area  which represents approximately 27% of the population of the country    Lisbon is recognised as a global city because of its importance in finance  commerce  media  entertainment  arts  international trade  education and tourism  It is one of the major economic centres on the continent  with a growing financial sector and one of the largest container ports on Europe s Atlantic coast  Lisbon Portela Airport serves over 18 million passengers annually  as of 2014  and the motorway network and the high speed rail system of Alfa Pendular link the main cities of Portugal  The city is the 7th most visited city in Southern Europe  after Istanbul  Rome  Barcelona  Madrid  Athens and Milan  with 1 740 000 tourists in 2009  The Lisbon region contributes with the highest GDP PPP per capita of any other region in Portugal  It also ranks as the 10th highest GDP of metropolitan areas in the EU amounting to 110 billion euros and thus €39 375 per capita  40% higher than the average European Union s GDP per capita  The city occupies 32nd place of highest gross earnings in the world  Most of the headquarters of multinationals in the country are located in the Lisbon area  It is also the political centre of the country  as seat of Government and residence of the Head of State   Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world  and the oldest in Western Europe  predating other modern European capitals such as London  Paris and Rome by centuries  Julius Caesar made it a municipium called Felicitas Julia  adding to the name Olissipo  Ruled by a series of Germanic tribes from the 5th century  it was captured by the Moors in the 8th century  In 1147  the Crusaders under Afonso Henriques reconquered the city and since then it has been a major political  economic and cultural centre of Portugal  Unlike most capital cities  Lisbon s status as the capital of Portugal has never been granted or confirmed officially – by statute or in written form  Its position as the capital has formed through constitutional convention  making its position as de facto capital a part of the Constitution of Portugal   Lisbon enjoys a Mediterranean climate  Among all the metropolises in Europe  it has the warmest winters  with average temperatures during the day and at night from December to February  The typical summer season lasts about six months  from May to October  although also in November  March and April temperatures sometimes reach around    1  Etymology  The name of Lisbon can be traced back Phoenecian times  when their settlement might have been named Allis Ubbo  Phoenician for  safe harbour   according to one of several conjectures on the origin of Lisbon s toponymy and the legend that Odysseus founded Lisbon  Another conjecture suggests that the settlement took the name of the pre Roman word for the Tagus  Lisso or Lucio   Lisbon s name was written Ulyssippo in Latin by the geographer Pomponius Mela  a native of Hispania  It was later referenced as  Olisippo  by Pliny the Elder and by the Greeks as Olissipo  Ὀλισσιπών  or Olissipona  Ὀλισσιπόνα    2  History  2 1  Pre Roman  During the Neolithic period  the region was inhabited by Pre Celtic tribes  who built religious and funerary monuments  megaliths  dolmens and menhirs  which still survive in areas on the periphery of Lisbon  The Indo European Celts invaded in the 1st millennium BC  mixing with the Pre Indo European population  thus giving rise to Celtic speaking local tribes such as the Cempsi   Archaeological findings suggest there were Phoenician influences dating back to 1200 BC  leading some historians to believe that a Phoenician trading post might have occupied the centre of the present city  on the southern slope of the Castle hill   The sheltered harbour in the Tagus River estuary was an ideal spot for a settlement and provided a secure port for provisioning of Phoenician ships travelling to the Islands of Tin  modern Isles of Scilly  and Cornwall  The Tagus settlement was also an important centre of commercial trade with inland tribes  providing an outlet for the valuable metals  salt and salted fish they collected  and for the sale of the Lusitanian horses renowned in antiquity  Although Phoenician remains from the 8th century BC were found beneath the Mediaeval Sé Cathedral  modern historians believe that Lisbon was an ancient autochthonous settlement  Roman oppidum  and that  at most  it maintained commercial relations with the Phoenicians  accounting for the discovery of Phoenician pottery and artefacts at the site    According to legend  the location was named for Ulysses  who founded the settlement after he left Troy to escape the Greek coalition  Later  the Greek name appeared in Vulgar Latin in the form Olissipona   2 2  Roman era  Following the defeat of Hannibal during the Punic wars  the Romans determined to deprive Carthage of its most valuable possession  Hispania  the Iberian Peninsula   The defeat of Carthaginian forces by Scipio Africanus in Eastern Hispania allowed the pacification of the west  led by Consul Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus  Decimus obtained the alliance of Olissipo  which sent men to fight alongside the Roman Legions against the northwestern Celtic tribes  by integrating it into the empire  as the Municipium Cives Romanorum Felicitas Julia  Local authorities were granted self rule over a territory that extended   exempt from taxes  its citizens were given the privileges of Roman citizenship  and it was then integrated with the Roman province of Lusitania  whose capital was Emerita Augusta    Lusitanian raids and rebellions during Roman occupation necessitated the construction of a wall around the settlement  During Augustus  reign  the Romans also built a great theatre  the Cassian Baths  underneath Rua da Prata   temples to Jupiter  Diana  Cybele  Tethys and Idea Phrygiae  an uncommon cult from Asia Minor   in addition to temples to the Emperor  a large necropolis under Praça da Figueira  a large forum and other buildings such as insulae  multi storied apartment buildings  in the area between the Castle Hill and the historic city core  Many of these ruins were first unearthed during the mid 18th century  when the recent discovery of Pompeii made Roman archaeology fashionable among Europe s upper classes    The city prospered as piracy was eliminated and technological advances were introduced as Felicitas Julia became a centre of trade with the Roman provinces of Britannia  particularly Cornwall  and the Rhine  Economically strong  Olissipo was known for its garum  a fish sauce highly prized by the elites of the empire and exported in amphorae to Rome   wine  salt and horse breeding  while Roman culture permeated the hinterland  The city was connected by a broad road to Western Hispania s two other large cities  Bracara Augusta in the province of Tarraconensis  Portuguese Braga   and Emerita Augusta  the capital of Lusitania  Mérida  Spain   The city was ruled by an oligarchical council dominated by two families  the Julii and the Cassiae  although regional authority was administered by the Roman Governor of Emerita or directly by Emperor Tiberius  Among the majority of Latin speakers lived a large minority of Greek traders and slaves   Around 80 BC  the Roman Quintus Sertorius led a rebellion against the dictator Sulla  During this period  he organised the tribes of Lusitania and Hispania and was on the verge of forming an independent province in the Sertorian War when he died   Olissipo  like most great cities in the Western Empire  was a centre for the dissemination of Christianity  Its first attested Bishop was Potamius  c  356   and there were several martyrs during the period of persecution of the Christians  Maxima  Verissimus and Eulalia of Mérida are the most significant examples  By the time of the Fall of Rome  Olissipo had become a notable Christian centre   Following the disintegration of the Roman Empire there were barbarian invasions  between 409 and 429 the city was occupied successively by Sarmatians  Alans and Vandals  The Germanic Suebi  who established a kingdom in Gallaecia  modern Galicia and northern Portugal   with its capital in Bracara Augusta  also controlled the region of Lisbon until 585  In 585  the Suebi Kingdom was integrated into the Germanic Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo  which comprised all of the Iberian Peninsula  Lisbon was then called Ulishbona   2 3  Middle Ages  On 6 August 711  Lisbon was taken by Muslim forces  These conquerors  who were mostly Berbers and Arabs from North Africa and the Middle East  built many mosques and houses  rebuilt the city wall  known as the Cerca Moura  and established administrative control  while permitting the diverse population  Muladi  Mozarabs  Berbers  Arabs  Jews  Zanj and Saqaliba  to maintain their socio cultural lifestyles  Mozarabic was the native language spoken by most of the Christian population  Islam was the official religion practised by the Arabs  Berbers  Zanj  Saqaliba and Muladi  muwalladun   the Christians were allowed to keep their religion under the status as Dhimmi subjects  and were allowed rights of residence in return for jizyah taxes  In return for paying this surtax  Christians and Jews were excluded from specific duties assigned to Muslims like joining the Islamic army  and their security was guaranteed by the Islamic state  but otherwise  the Christians and Jews were equal to Muslims under the laws of property  contract and obligation  The Muslim influence is still present in the Alfama  an old quarter of Lisbon that survived the 1755 Lisbon earthquake  many place names are derived from Arabic and the Alfama  the oldest existing district of Lisbon  was derived from the Arabic  al hamma    For a brief time  Lisbon was the central town in the Regulo Eslavo of the Taifa of Badajoz  and then as an independent Taifa  as the Taifa of Lisbon   The well known Medieval Arab geographer Muhammad al Idrisi noted that Muslim Lisbon was the home of daring explorers known under the name of Mughamarin  Adventurers   who had penetrated deep into the Atlantic  by some theories actually reaching America   prefiguring by several centuries the major role which Christian explorers from the same city would later play   In 1108 the city was raided by Norwegian crusaders led by Sigurd I on their way to the Holy Land as part of the Norwegian Crusade  It was taken by the Moorish Almoravids in 1111  In 1147  as part of the Reconquista  crusader knights led by Afonso I of Portugal besieged and reconquered Lisbon  The city  with around 154 000 residents at the time  was returned to Christian rule  The reconquest of Portugal and re establishment of Christianity is one of the most significant events in Lisbon s history  described in the chronicle Expugnatione Lyxbonensi  which describes  among other incidents  how the local bishop was killed by the crusaders and the city s residents prayed to the Virgin Mary as it happened  Many of the remaining Muslim residents were converted to Roman Catholicism by force  or were expelled  and their mosques were either destroyed or converted into churches  As a result  spoken Arabic gradually lost its place in the everyday life of the city   In a raid against Lisbon in 1189  the Almohad caliph  Abu Yusuf Yaqub al Mansur  took 3 000 female and child captives   With its central location  Lisbon became the capital city of the new Portuguese territory in 1255  The first Portuguese university was founded in Lisbon in 1290 by King Denis I  for many years the Studium Generale  General Study  was transferred intermittently to Coimbra  where it was installed permanently in the 16th century as the University of Coimbra   In 1384  the city was besieged by King Juan I of Castille  as a part of the ongoing 1383–1385 Crisis  The result of the siege was a victory for the Portuguese led by Nuno Álvares Pereira   During the last centuries of the Middle Ages  the city expanded substantially and became an important trading post with both Northern European and Mediterranean cities   2 4  Early Modern  Most of the Portuguese expeditions of the Age of Discovery left from Lisbon during the 15th to 17th centuries  including Vasco da Gama s expedition to India in 1497  In 1506  3 000 Jews were massacred in Lisbon  The 16th century was Lisbon s golden era  the city was the European hub of commerce between Africa  India  the Far East and later  Brazil  and acquired great riches by exploiting the trade in spices  slaves  sugar  textiles and other goods  This period saw the rise of the exuberant Manueline style in architecture  which left its mark in many 16th century monuments  including Lisbon s Belém Tower and Jerónimos Monastery  which were declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites   A description of Lisbon in the 16th century was written by Damião de Góis and published in 1554   Portugal lost its independence to Spain after the succession crisis of 1580  initiating a sixty year period of dual monarchy in Portugal and Spain under the Spanish Habsburgs  This is referred to as the  Philippine Dominion   Domínio Filipino   since all three Spanish kings during that period were called Philip  Filipe   The Portuguese Restoration War  which began with a coup d état organised by the nobility and bourgeoisie in Lisbon and executed on 1 December 1640  restored Portuguese independence  The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain  as well as short episodes of more serious warfare  until the Treaty of Lisbon was signed in 1688   In the early 18th century  gold from Brazil allowed King John V to sponsor the building of several Baroque churches and theatres in the city  Prior to the 18th century  Lisbon had experienced several significant earthquakes – eight in the 14th century  five in the 16th century  including the 1531 earthquake that destroyed 1 500 houses and the 1597 earthquake in which three streets vanished   and three in the 17th century  On 1 November 1755  the city was destroyed by another devastating earthquake  which killed an estimated 30 000 to 40 000 Lisbon residents of a population estimated at between 200 000 and 275 000  and destroyed 85 percent of the city s structures  Among several important buildings of the city  the Ribeira Palace and the Hospital Real de Todos os Santos were lost  In coastal areas  such as Peniche  situated about north of Lisbon  many people were killed by the following tsunami   By 1755  Lisbon was one of the largest cities in Europe  the catastrophic event shocked the whole of Europe and left a deep impression on its collective psyche  Voltaire wrote a long poem  Poême sur le désastre de Lisbonne  shortly after the quake  and mentioned it in his 1759 novel Candide  indeed  many argue that this critique of optimism was inspired by that earthquake   Oliver Wendell Holmes  Sr  also mentions it in his 1857 poem  The Deacon s Masterpiece  or The Wonderful One Hoss Shay  After the 1755 earthquake  the city was rebuilt largely according to the plans of Prime Minister Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo  the 1st Marquess of Pombal  the lower town began to be known as the Baixa Pombalina  Pombaline central district   Instead of rebuilding the medieval town  Pombal decided to demolish what remained after the earthquake and rebuild the city centre in accordance with principles of modern urban design  It was reconstructed in an open rectangular plan with two great squares  the Praça do Rossio and the Praça do Comércio  The first  the central commercial district  is the traditional gathering place of the city and the location of the older cafés  theatres and restaurants  the second became the city s main access to the River Tagus and point of departure and arrival for seagoing vessels  adorned by a triumphal arch  1873  and monument to King Joseph I   2 5  Late modern and contemporary  In the first years of the 19th century  Portugal was invaded by the troops of Napoléon Bonaparte  forcing Queen Maria I and Prince Regent John  future John VI  to flee temporarily to Brazil  By the time the new King returned to Lisbon  many of the buildings and properties were pillaged  sacked or destroyed by the invaders   During the 19th century  the Liberal movement introduced new changes into the urban landscape  The principal areas were in the Baixa and along the Chiado district  where shops  tobacconists shops  cafés  bookstores  clubs and theatres proliferated  The development of industry and commerce determined the growth of the city  extending north along the Avenida da Liberdade  1879   distancing itself from the Tagus River   Lisbon was the site of the regicide of Carlos I of Portugal in 1908  an event which culminated two years later in the First Republic   The city refounded its university in 1911 after centuries of inactivity in Lisbon  incorporating reformed former colleges and other non university higher education schools of the city  such as the Escola Politécnica – now Faculdade de Ciências   Today there are two public universities in the city  University of Lisbon and New University of Lisbon   a public university institute  ISCTE   Lisbon University Institute  and a polytechnic institute  IPL – Instituto Politécnico de Lisboa    During World War II  Lisbon was one of the very few neutral  open European Atlantic ports  a major gateway for refugees to the U S  and a haven for spies  More than 100 000 refugees were able to flee Nazi Germany via Lisbon   During the Estado Novo regime  1926–1974   Lisbon was expanded at the cost of other districts within the country  resulting in nationalist and monumental projects  New residential and public developments were constructed  the zone of Belém was modified for the 1940 Portuguese Exhibition  while along the periphery new districts appeared to house the growing population  The inauguration of the bridge over the Tagus allowed rapid connection between both sides of the river   Lisbon was the site of three revolutions in the 20th century  The first  the 5 October 1910 revolution  brought an end to the Portuguese monarchy and established the highly unstable and corrupt Portuguese First Republic  The 6 June 1926 revolution would see the end of that first republic and firmly establish the Estado Novo  or the Portuguese Second Republic  as the ruling regime  The final revolution  the Carnation Revolution  would take place on 25 April 1974 and would end the right wing Estado Novo and reform the country as the current Portuguese Third Republic  In the 1990s  many of the districts were renovated and projects in the historic quarters were established to modernise those areas  architectural and patrimonial buildings were recuperated  the northern margin of the Tagus was re purposed for leisure and residential use  the Vasco da Gama Bridge was constructed  and the eastern part of the municipality was re purposed for Expo  98  to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama s sea voyage to India  a voyage that would bring immense riches to Lisbon and cause many of Lisbon s landmarks to be built   In 1988  a fire in the historical district of Chiado saw the destruction of many 18th century Pombaline style buildings  A series of restoration works has brought the area back to its former self and made it a high scale shopping district   The Lisbon Agenda was a European Union agreement on measures to revitalise the EU economy  signed in Lisbon in March 2000  In October 2007 Lisbon hosted the 2007 EU Summit  where agreement was reached regarding a new EU governance model  The resulting Treaty of Lisbon was signed on 13 December 2007 and came into force on 1 December 2009   Lisbon has been the site for many international events and programmes  In 1994  Lisbon was the European Capital of Culture  On 3 November 2005  Lisbon hosted the MTV European Music Awards  On 7 July 2007  Lisbon held the ceremony of the  New 7 Wonders Of The World  election  in the Luz Stadium  with live transmission for millions of people all over the world  Every two years  Lisbon hosts the Rock in Rio Lisboa Music Festival  one of the largest in the world  Lisbon hosted the NATO summit  19–20 November 2010   a summit meeting that is regarded as a periodic opportunity for Heads of State and Heads of Government of NATO member states to evaluate and provide strategic direction for Alliance activities   3  Geography  3 1  Physical geography  Lisbon is located at   situated at the mouth of the Tagus River and is the westernmost capital of a mainland European country   The westernmost part of Lisbon is occupied by the Parque Florestal de Monsanto  English  Monsanto Forest Park   an urban park  one of the largest in Europe  and occupying ten percent of the municipality   The city occupies an area of   and its city boundaries  unlike those of most major cities  are narrowly defined by its historical centre  The rest of the urbanised area of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area  known generically as Greater Lisbon     is actually several administratively defined cities and municipalities  such as Amadora  Queluz  Agualva Cacém  Odivelas  Loures  Sacavém  Almada  Barreiro  Seixal and Oeiras  3 2  Climate  Lisbon enjoys a Subtropical Mediterranean climate  Köppen climate classification  Csa  with mild winters and warm summers  The

may more commonly refer to the spaces of Lisbon in terms of historic bairros  neighbourhoods   These communities have no clearly defined boundaries and represent distinctive quarters of the city that have in common an historical culture  similar living standards  and identifiable architectural landmarks  as exemplified by the Bairro Alto  Alfama  Chiado  and so forth   3 4 1  Alcântara  Although today it is quite central  it was once a mere suburb of Lisbon  comprising mostly farms and country estates of the nobility with their palaces  In the 16th century  there was a brook there which the nobles used to promenade in their boats  During the late 19th century  Alcântara became a popular industrial area  with lots of small factories and warehouses   In the early 1990s  Alcântara began to attract youth because of the number of pubs and discothèques  This was mainly due to its outer area of mostly commercial buildings  which acted as barriers to the noise generating nightlife  which acted as a buffer to the residential communities surrounding it   In the meantime  some of these areas began to become gentrified  attracting loft developments and new flats  which have profited from its river views and central location   3 4 2  Alfama  The oldest district of Lisbon  it spreads down the southern slope from the Castle of São Jorge to the River Tagus  Its name  derived from the Arabic Al hamma  means fountains or baths  During the Islamic invasion of Iberia  the Alfama constituted the largest part of the city  extending west to the Baixa neighbourhood  Increasingly  the Alfama became inhabited by fishermen and the poor  its fame as a poor neighbourhood continues to this day  While the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake caused considerable damage throughout the capital  the Alfama survived with little damage  thanks to its compact labyrinth of narrow streets and small squares  It is an historical quarter of mixed use buildings occupied by Fado bars  restaurants  and homes with small shops downstairs  Modernising trends have invigorated the district  old houses have been re purposed or remodelled  while new buildings have been constructed  Fado  the typically Portuguese style of melancholy music  is common  but not obligatory  in the restaurants of the district   3 4 3  Mouraria  The Mouraria  or Moorish quarter  is one of the most traditional neighborhoods of Lisbon  although most of its old buildings were demolished by the Estado Novo between the 1930s and the 1970s  It takes its name from the fact that after the reconquest of Lisbon  the Muslims who remained were confined to this part of the city  In turn  the Jews were confined to three neighbourhoods called Juderías    3 4 4  Bairro Alto  Bairro Alto  literally the upper quarter in Portuguese  is an area of central Lisbon that functions as a residential  shopping and entertainment district  it is the centre of the Portuguese capital s nightlife  attracting hipster youth and members of various music subcultures  Lisbon s Punk  Gay  Metal  Goth  Hip Hop and Reggae scenes all find a home in the Bairro with its many clubs and bars that cater to them  The crowds in the Bairro Alto are a multicultural mix of people representing a broad cross section of modern Portuguese society  many of them being entertainment seekers and devotees of various music genres outside the mainstream  yet Fado  Portugal s national music  still survives in the midst of the new nightlife   3 4 5  Baixa  The heart of the city is the Baixa or city centre  the Pombaline Baixa is an elegant district  primarily constructed after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake  taking its name from its benefactor  1st Marquess of Pombal  Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo  who was the minister of Joseph I of Portugal  1750–1777  and a key figure during the Portuguese Enlightenment  Following the 1755 disaster  Pombal took the lead in rebuilding Lisbon  imposing strict conditions and guidelines on the construction of the city  and transforming the organic street plan that characterised the district before the earthquake into its current grid pattern  As a result  the Pombaline Baixa is one of the first examples of earthquake resistant construction  Architectural models were tested by having troops march around them to simulate an earthquake  Notable features of Pombaline structures include the Pombaline cage  a symmetrical wood lattice framework aimed at distributing earthquake forces  and inter terrace walls that were built higher than roof timbers to inhibit the spread of fires   3 4 6  Belém  Belém is famous as the place from which many of the great Portuguese explorers set off on their voyages of discovery  In particular  it is the place from which Vasco da Gama departed for India in 1497 and Pedro Álvares Cabral departed for Brazil in 1499  It is also a former royal residence and features the 17th–18th century Belém Palace  a former royal residence now occupied by the President of Portugal  and the Ajuda Palace  begun in 1802 but never completed   Perhaps Belém s most famous feature is its tower  Torre de Belém  whose image is much used by Lisbon s tourist board  The tower was built as a fortified lighthouse late in the reign of Dom Manuel l  1515–1520  to guard the entrance to the port  It stood on a little island in right side of the Tagus  surrounded by water  Belém s other major historical building is the Mosteiro dos Jerónimos  Jerónimos Monastery   which the Torre de Belém was built partly to defend  Belém s most notable modern feature is the Padrão dos Descobrimentos  Monument to the Discoveries  built for the Portuguese World Fair in 1940  In the heart of Belém is the Praça do Império  gardens centred upon a large fountain  laid out during World War II  To the west of the gardens lies the Centro Cultural de Belém  Belém is one of the most visited Lisbon districts   3 4 7  Chiado  The Chiado is a traditional shopping area that mixes old and modern commercial establishments  concentrated specially in the Rua do Carmo and the Rua Garrett  Locals as well as tourists visit the Chiado to buy books  clothing and pottery as well as to have a cup of coffee  The most famous café of Chiado is A Brasileira  famous for having had poet Fernando Pessoa among its customers  The Chiado is also an important cultural area  with several museums and theatres  including the opera  Several buildings of the Chiado were destroyed in a fire in 1988  an event that deeply shocked the country  Thanks to a renovation project that lasted more than 10 years  coordinated by celebrated architect Siza Vieira  the affected area has now virtually recovered   3 4 8  Estrela  The ornate  late 18th century Estrela Basilica is the main attraction of this district  The church with its large dome is located on a hill in what was at the time the western part of Lisbon and can be seen from great distances  The style is similar to that of the Mafra National Palace  late baroque and neoclassical  The façade has twin bell towers and includes statues of saints and some allegorical figures  São Bento Palace  the seat of the Portuguese parliament and the official residences of the Prime Minister of Portugal and the President of the Assembly of the Republic of Portugal  are in this district   3 4 9  Parque das Nações  Parque das Nações  Park of
