The Sculptor Group is a loose group of galaxies near the south galactic pole  The group is one of the closest groups of galaxies to the Local Group  the distance to the center of the group from the Milky Way is approximately    The Sculptor Galaxy  NGC 253  and a few other galaxies form a gravitationally bound core in the center of this group  A few other galaxies at the periphery may be associated with the group but may not be gravitationally bound  Because most of the galaxies in this group are actually weakly gravitationally bound  the group may also be described as a filament   1  Members  The table below lists galaxies that have been identified as associated with the Sculptor Galaxy  and hence associated with the group  by I  D  Karachentsev and collaborators   Note that the object names used in the above table differ from the names used by Karachentsev and collaborators  NGC  IC  UGC  and PGC numbers have been used when possible to allow for easier referencing   1 1  Foreground galaxies  The irregular galaxy NGC 55  the spiral galaxy NGC 300  and their companion galaxies have been considered by many researchers to be part of this group  However  recent distance measurements to these and other galaxies in the same region of the sky show that NGC 55  NGC 300  and their companions may simply be foreground galaxies that are physically unassociated with the Sculptor Group   2  References
