A library classification  or a bibliographic classification  is a system according to which library materials  such as books  serials  audiovisual materials  computer files  maps  manuscripts  realia and documents  are arranged on library shelves  typically according to subject  and allocating a call number  Library classification systems group related materials together  typically arranged in a hierarchical tree structure  A different kind of classification system  called a faceted classification system  is also widely used which allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object  enabling the classifications to be ordered in multiple ways  The library classification is distinct from the International Standard Book Number  ISBN  or International Standard Serial Number  ISSN  systems  which are unique commercial product identifiers  the first for books the second for serial publications  that can be used for tracking individual library materials  such as for lending of the materials by the library   1  Description  Library classification is an aspect of library and information science  It is a form of bibliographic classification  library classifications are used in library catalogs  while  bibliographic classification  also covers classification used in other kinds of bibliographic databases   Library classification is associated with library  descriptive  cataloging under the rubric of cataloging and classification  sometimes grouped together as technical services  The library professional who engages in the process of cataloging and classifying library materials is called a cataloger or catalog librarian  Library classification systems are one of the two tools used to facilitate subject access  The other consists of alphabetical indexing languages such as Thesauri and Subject Headings systems   Library classification of a piece of work consists of two steps  Firstly  the  aboutness  of the material is ascertained  Next  a call number  essentially a book s address  based on the classification system in use at the particular library will be assigned to the work using the notation of the system   It is important to note that unlike subject heading or thesauri where multiple terms can be assigned to the same work  in library classification systems  each work can only be placed in one class  This is due to shelving purposes  A book can have only one physical place  However in classified catalogs one may have main entries as well as added entries  Most classification systems like the Dewey Decimal Classification  DDC  and Library of Congress classification also add a cutter number to each work which adds a code for the author of the work   Classification systems in libraries generally play two roles  Firstly  they facilitate subject access by allowing the user to find out what works or documents the library has on a certain subject  Secondly  they provide a known location for the information source to be located  e g  where it is shelved    Until the 19th century  most libraries had closed stacks  so the library classification only served to organize the subject catalog  In the 20th century  libraries opened their stacks to the public and started to shelve library material itself according to some library classification to simplify subject browsing   Some classification systems are more suitable for aiding subject access  rather than for shelf location  For example  Universal Decimal Classification  which uses a complicated notation of pluses and colons  is more difficult to use for the purpose of shelf arrangement but is more expressive compared to DDC in terms of showing relationships between subjects  Similarly faceted classification schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement  unless the user has knowledge of the citation order   Depending on the size of the library collection  some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other  In extreme cases  a public library with a small collection might just use a classification system for location of resources but might not use a complicated subject classification system  Instead all resources might just be put into a couple of wide classes  travel  crime  magazines etc    This is known as a  mark and park  classification method  more formally called reader interest classification   2  Types  There are many standard systems of library classification in use  and many more have been proposed over the years  However in general  classification systems can be divided into three types depending on how they are used   Universal schemes which cover all subjects  for example the Dewey Decimal Classification  Universal Decimal Classification and Library of Congress Classification  Specific classification schemes which cover particular subjects or types of materials  for example Iconclass  British Catalogue of Music Classification  and Dickinson classification  or the NLM Classification for medicine   National schemes which are specially created for certain countries  for example the Swedish library classification system  SAB  Sveriges Allmänna Biblioteksförening   In terms of functionality  classification systems are often described as   enumerative  subject headings are listed alphabetically  with numbers assigned to each heading in alphabetical order   hierarchical  subjects are divided hierarchically  from most general to most specific   faceted or analytico synthetic  subjects are divided into mutually exclusive orthogonal facets  There are few completely enumerative systems or faceted systems  most systems are a blend but favouring one type or the other  The most common classification systems  LCC and DDC  are essentially enumerative  though with some hierarchical and faceted elements  more so for DDC   especially at the broadest and most general level  The first true faceted system was the Colon classification of S  R  Ranganathan   2 1  English language universal classification systems  The most common systems in English speaking countries are   Dewey Decimal Classification  DDC   Library of Congress Classification  LCC   Colon classification  CC  Other systems include   BISAC subject headings  the publishing industry standard for classification that is being adopted by some libraries   THEMA subject headings  a relatively new  2013  book classification systems for publishers and booksellers that aims to combine BIC  BISAC and others into a single classification structure for the worldwide book trade

different lists to represent the different attributes of a work  heavily  which is comparatively lacking in LC or DDC   3  Comparing classification systems  As a result of differences in notation  history  use of enumeration  hierarchy  and facets  classification systems can differ in the following ways   Type of Notation  Notation can be pure  consisting of only numerals  for example  or mixed  consisting of letters and numerals  or letters  numerals  and other symbols    Expressiveness  This is the degree to which the notation can express relationship between concepts or structure   Whether they support mnemonics  For example the number 44 in DDC notation often means it concerns some aspect of France  For example in the Dewey classification 598 0944 concerns  Birds in France   the 09 signifies geographical division  and 44 represents France   Hospitality  The degree to which the system is able to accommodate new subjects   Brevity  The length of the notation to express the same concept   Speed of updates and degree of support  The better classification systems are frequently being reviewed and    Consistency  Simplicity  Usability  4  See also  Attribute value system
