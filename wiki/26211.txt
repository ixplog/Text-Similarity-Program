Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO  is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization  The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering  and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them  closing a perceived loophole that allowed someone who told a man to  for example  murder  to be exempt from the trial because he did not actually commit the crime personally   RICO was enacted by section 901 a  of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970     RICO is codified as Chapter 96 of Title 18 of the United States Code  18 U S C  § 1961–1968  G  Robert Blakey  an adviser to the United States Senate Government Operations Committee  drafted the law under the close supervision of the committee s chairman  Senator John Little McClellan  It was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970  and signed into law by Richard M  Nixon  While its original use in the 1970s was to prosecute the Mafia as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime  its later application has been more widespread   Beginning in 1972  33 States adopted state RICO laws to be able to prosecute similar conduct   1  Summary  Under RICO  a person who has committed  at least two acts of racketeering activity  drawn from a list of 35 crimes—27 federal crimes and 8 state crimes—within a 10 year period can be charged with racketeering if such acts are related in one of four specified ways to an  enterprise   Those found guilty of racketeering can be fined up to $25 000 and sentenced to 20 years in prison per racketeering count  In addition  the racketeer must forfeit all ill gotten gains and interest in any business gained through a pattern of  racketeering activity    When the U S  Attorney decides to indict someone under RICO  he or she has the option of seeking a pre trial restraining order or injunction to temporarily seize a defendant s assets and prevent the transfer of potentially forfeitable property  as well as require the defendant to put up a performance bond  This provision was placed in the law because the owners of Mafia related shell corporations often absconded with the assets  An injunction and or performance bond ensures that there is something to seize in the event of a guilty verdict   In many cases  the threat of a RICO indictment can force defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges  in part because the seizure of assets would make it difficult to pay a defense attorney  Despite its harsh provisions  a RICO related charge is considered easy to prove in court  as it focuses on patterns of behavior as opposed to criminal acts   RICO also permits a private individual  damaged in his business or property  by a  racketeer  to file a civil suit  The plaintiff must prove the existence of an  enterprise   The defendant s  are not the enterprise  in other words  the defendant s  and the enterprise are not one and the same  There must be one of four specified relationships between the defendant s  and the enterprise  either the defendant s  invested the proceeds of the pattern of racketeering activity into the enterprise  or the defendant s  acquired or maintained an interest in  or control over  the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity  or the defendant s  conducted or participated in the affairs of the enterprise  through  the pattern of racketeering activity  or the defendant s  conspired to do one of the above  In essence  the enterprise is either the  prize    instrument    victim   or  perpetrator  of the racketeers  A civil RICO action can be filed in state or federal court   Both the criminal and civil components allow the recovery of treble damages  damages in triple the amount of actual compensatory damages    Although its primary intent was to deal with organized crime  Blakey said that Congress never intended it to merely apply to the Mob  He once told Time   We don t want one set of rules for people whose collars are blue or whose names end in vowels  and another set for those whose collars are white and have Ivy League diplomas    Initially  prosecutors were skeptical of using RICO  mainly because it was unproven  However  during the 1980s and 1990s  federal prosecutors utilized the law to bring charges against several Mafia figures  The first major success was the Mafia Commission Trial  which resulted in several top leaders of New York City s Five Families getting what amounted to life sentences  By the turn of the century  RICO cases resulted in virtually all of the top leaders of the New York Mafia being sent to prison   2  State laws  Beginning in 1972  33 states  as well as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands  adopted state RICO laws to cover additional state offenses under a similar scheme   3  RICO predicate offenses  Under the law  the meaning of racketeering activity is set out at   As currently amended it includes   Any violation of state statutes against gambling  murder  kidnapping  extortion  arson  robbery  bribery  dealing in obscene matter  or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical  as defined in the Controlled Substances Act    Any act of bribery  counterfeiting  theft  embezzlement  fraud  dealing in obscene matter  obstruction of justice  slavery  racketeering  gambling  money laundering  commission of murder for hire  and many other offenses covered under the Federal criminal code  Title 18    Embezzlement of union funds   Bankruptcy fraud or securities fraud   Drug trafficking  long term and elaborate drug networks can also be prosecuted using the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute   Criminal copyright infringement   Money laundering and related offenses   Bringing in  aiding or assisting aliens in illegally entering the country  if the action was for financial gain    Acts of terrorism  Pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity  one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years  excluding any period of imprisonment  after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity  The U S  Supreme Court has instructed federal courts to follow the continuity plus relationship test in order to determine whether the facts of a specific case give rise to an established pattern  Predicate acts are related if they  have the same or similar purposes  results  participants  victims  or methods of commission  or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events    H J  Inc  v  Northwestern Bell Telephone Co   Continuity is both a closed and open ended concept  referring to either a closed period of conduct  or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition   4  Application of RICO laws  Although some of the RICO predicate acts are extortion and blackmail  one of the most successful applications of the RICO laws has been the ability to indict or sanction individuals for their behavior and actions committed against witnesses and victims in alleged retaliation or retribution for cooperating with federal law enforcement or intelligence agencies   Violations of the RICO laws can be alleged in civil lawsuit cases or for criminal charges  In these instances charges can be brought against individuals or corporations in retaliation for said individuals or corporations working with law enforcement  Further  charges can also be brought against individuals or corporations who have sued or filed criminal charges against a defendant   Anti SLAPP  strategic lawsuit against public participation  laws can be applied in an attempt to curb alleged abuses of the legal system by individuals or corporations who utilize the courts as a weapon to retaliate against whistle blowers  victims  or to silence another s speech  RICO could be alleged if it can be shown that lawyers and or their clients conspired and collaborated to concoct fictitious legal complaints solely in retribution and retaliation for themselves having been brought before the courts   Although the RICO laws may cover drug trafficking crimes in addition to other more traditional RICO predicate acts such as extortion  blackmail  and racketeering  large scale and organized drug networks are now commonly prosecuted under the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute  also known as the  Kingpin Statute   The CCE laws target only traffickers who are responsible for long term and elaborate conspiracies  whereas the RICO law covers a variety of organized criminal behaviors   5  Famous cases  5 1  Hells Angels Motorcycle Club  In 1979  the United States federal government went after Sonny Barger and several members and associates of the Oakland charter of the Hells Angels using RICO  In United States v  Barger  the prosecution team attempted to demonstrate a pattern of behavior to convict Barger and other members of the club of RICO offenses related to guns and illegal drugs  The jury acquitted Barger on the RICO charges with a hung jury on the predicate acts   There was no proof it was part of club policy  and as much as they tried  the government could not come up with any incriminating minutes from any of our meetings mentioning drugs and guns    5 2  Frank Tieri  On November 21  1980  Genovese crime family boss Frank  Funzi  Tieri was the first Mafia boss to be convicted under the RICO Act   5 3  Catholic sex abuse cases  In some jurisdictions  RICO suits have been filed against Catholic dioceses  using racketeering laws to prosecute the highers up in the episcopacy for abuses committed by those under their authority  A Cleveland grand jury cleared two bishops of racketeering charges  finding that their mishandling of sex abuse claims did not amount to criminal racketeering  Certain lawyers and abuse advocates have openly wondered why a similar suit was not filed against archbishop Bernard Law prior to his getting reassigned to Vatican City   5 4  Gil Dozier  Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Gil Dozier  in office from 1976 to 1980  faced indictment with violations of both the Hobbs and the RICO laws  He was accused of compelling companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf  On September 23  1980  the Baton Rouge based United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of five counts of extortion and racketeering  The sentence of ten years imprisonment  later upgraded to eighteen when other offenses were determined  and a $25 000 fine was suspended pending appeal  and Dozier remained free on bail  He eventually served nearly four years until a presidential commutation freed him in 1986   5 5  Key West PD  About June 1984  the Key West Police Department located in the County of Monroe  Florida  was declared a criminal enterprise under the federal RICO statutes after a lengthy United States Department of Justice investigation  Several high ranking officers of the department  including Deputy Police Chief Raymond Cassamayor  were arrested on federal charges of running a protection racket for illegal cocaine smugglers  At trial  a witness testified he routinely delivered bags of cocaine to the Deputy Chief s office at City Hall   5 6  Michael Milken  On March 29  1989  American financier Michael Milken was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud relating to an investigation into an allegation of insider trading and other offenses  Milken was accused of using a wide ranging network of contacts to manipulate stock and bond prices  It was one of the first occasions that a RICO indictment was brought against an individual with no ties to organized crime  Milken pled guilty to six lesser felonies of securities fraud and tax evasion rather than risk spending the rest of his life in prison  and ended up serving 22 months in prison  Milken was also ordered banned for life from the securities industry   On September 7  1988  Milken s employer  Drexel Burnham Lambert  was threatened with RICO charges respondat superior  the legal doctrine that corporations are responsible for their employees  crimes  Drexel avoided RICO charges by entering an Alford plea to lesser felonies of stock parking and stock manipulation  In a carefully worded plea  Drexel said it was  not in a position to dispute the allegations  made by the government  If Drexel had been indicted for RICO violations  it would have had to post a performance bond of up to $1 billion to avoid having its assets frozen  This would have taken precedence over all of the firm s other obligations—including the loans that provided 96 percent of its capital  If the bond ever had to be paid  its shareholders would have been practically wiped out  Since banks will not extend credit to a firm indicted under RICO  an indictment would have likely put Drexel out of business  By at least one estimate  a RICO indictment would have destroyed the firm within a month  Years later  Drexel president and CEO Fred Joseph said that Drexel had no choice but to plead guilty because  a financial institution cannot survive a RICO indictment    5 7  Major League Baseball  In 2002  the former minority owners of the Montreal Expos baseball team filed charges under the RICO Act against Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig and former Expos owner Jeffrey Loria  claiming that Selig and Loria deliberately conspired to devalue the team for personal benefit in preparation for a move  If found liable  Major League Baseball could have been responsible for up to $300 million in punitive damages  The case lasted two years  successfully stalling the Expos  move to Washington or contraction during that time  It was eventually sent to arbitration where the arbiters ruled in favor of Major League Baseball  permitting the move to Washington to take place   5 8  Pro life activists  RICO laws were successfully cited in NOW v  Scheidler  510 U S  249  114 S  Ct  798  127 L Ed  2d 99  1994   a suit in which certain parties  including the National Organization for Women  sought damages and an injunction against pro life activists who physically block access to abortion clinics  The Court held that a RICO enterprise does not need an economic motive  and that the Pro Life Action Network could therefore qualify as a RICO enterprise  The Court remanded for consideration of whether PLAN committed the requisite acts in a pattern of racketeering activity   5 9  Los Angeles Police Department  In April 2000  Federal judge William J  Rea in Los Angeles  ruling in one Rampart Scandal case  said that the plaintiffs could pursue RICO claims against the LAPD  an unprecedented finding  The idea that a police organization could be characterized as a racketeering enterprise shook up City Hall and further damaged the already tarnished image of the LAPD  However  in July 2001  U S  District Judge Gary A  Feess said that the plaintiffs do not have standing to sue the LAPD under RICO because they are alleging personal injuries rather than economic or property damage   5 10  Mohawk Industries  On April 26  2006  the Supreme Court heard Mohawk Industries  Inc  v  Williams    which concerned what sort of corporations fell under the scope of RICO  Mohawk Industries had allegedly hired illegal aliens  in violation of RICO  The court was asked to decide whether Mohawk Industries  along with recruiting agencies  constitutes an  enterprise  that can be prosecuted under RICO  but in June of that year dismissed the case and remanded it to Court of Appeals   5 11  Latin Kings  On August 20  2006  in Tampa  Florida  most of the state leadership members of the street gang  the Latin Kings  were arrested in connection with RICO conspiracy charges to engage in racketeering and currently await trial  The operation  called  Broken Crown   targeted statewide leadership of the Latin Kings  The raid occurred at the Caribbean American Club  Along with Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office  Tampa Police Department  the State Attorney’s Office  the FBI  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  and the federal Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco and Firearms were involved in the operation  Included in the arrest were leader Gilberto Santana from Brooklyn NY  Captain Luis Hernandez from Miami FL  Affiliate Celina Hernandez  Affiliate Michael Rocca  Affiliate Jessica Ramirez  Affiliate Reinaldo Arroyo  Affiliate Samual Alvarado  Omari Tolbert  Edwin DeLeon  and many others  totaling 39   5 12  Gambino crime family  Also  in Tampa  on October 16  2006  four members of the Gambino crime family  Capo Ronald Trucchio  Terry Scaglione  Steven Catallono and associate Kevin McMahon  were tried under RICO statutes  found guilty and sentenced to life in prison   5 13  Lucchese Crime Family  In the mid 1990s  prosecuting attorneys Gregory O’Connell and Charles Rose used RICO charges to bring down the Lucchese family within an 18 month period  Dismantling the Lucchese family had a profound financial impact on previously Mafia held businesses such as construction  garment  and garbage hauling  Here they dominated and extorted money through taxes  dues  and fees  An example of this extortion was through the garbage business  Hauling of garbage from the World Trade Center cost the building owners $1 2 million per year to be removed when the Mafia monopolized the business  as compared to $150 000 per year when competitive bids could be sought   5 14  Chicago Outfit  In 2005  the U S  Department of Justice s Operation Family Secrets indicted 15 Outfit members and associates under RICO predicates  Five defendants were convicted of RICO violations and other crimes  Six plead guilty  two died before trial and one was too sick to be tried   5 15  Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella  A federal grand jury in the Middle District of Pennsylvania handed down a 48 count indictment against former Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas Judges Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella  The judges were charged with RICO after allegedly committing acts of wire fraud  mail fraud  tax evasion  money laundering  and honest services fraud  The judges were accused of taking kickbacks for housing juveniles  that the judges convicted of mostly petty crimes  at a private detention center  The incident was dubbed by many local and national newspapers as the  Kids for cash scandal   On February 18  2011  a federal jury found Michael Ciavarella guilty of racketeering because of his involvement in accepting illegal payments from Robert Mericle  the developer of PA Child Care  and Attorney Robert Powell  a co owner of the facility  Ciavarella is facing 38 other counts in federal court   5 16  Scott W  Rothstein  Scott W  Rothstein is a disbarred lawyer and the former managing shareholder  chairman  and chief executive officer of the now defunct Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law firm  He is accused of funding his philanthropy  political contributions  law firm salaries  and an extravagant lifestyle with a massive 1 2 billion dollar Ponzi scheme  On December 1  2009  Rothstein turned himself in to federal authorities and was subsequently arrested on charges related to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  RICO   Although his arraignment plea was not guilty  Rothstein cooperated with the government and reversed his plea to guilty of five federal crimes on January 27  2010  Bond was denied by U S  Magistrate Judge Robin Rosenbaum  who ruled that due to his ability to forge documents  he was considered a flight risk  On June 9  2010  Rothstein received a 50 year prison sentence after a hearing in federal court in Fort Lauderdale   5 17  AccessHealthSource  Eleven defendants were indicted on RICO charges for allegedly assisting AccessHealthSource  a local health care provider  in obtaining and maintaining lucrative contracts with local and state government entities in the city of El Paso  Texas  “through bribery of and kickbacks to elected officials or himself and others  extortion under color of authority  fraudulent schemes and artifices  false pretenses  promises and representations and deprivation of the right of citizens to the honest services of their elected local officials”  see indictment    6  International equivalents to RICO  The US RICO legislation has other equivalents in the rest of the world  In spite of Interpol having a standardized definition of RICO like crimes  the interpretation and national implementation in legislation  and enforcement  widely varies  Most nations do cooperate with the US on RICO enforcement only where their own related laws are specifically broken  but this is in line with the Interpol protocols for such matters   By nation  alphabetically  In Australia the Australian Crime Commission has powers based on similar legislation and regulations   In Canada the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions enforce rules and regulations that cumulatively are equivalent to RICO   New Zealand has a similar arrangement and commission to Australia  Without other nations enforcing similar legislation to RICO many cross border RICO cases would not be possible  In the overall body of RICO cases that went to trial  at least 50% have had some non US enforcement component to them  The offshoring of money away from the US finance system as part racketeering  and especially money laundering  is typically a major contributing factor to this   However  other countries have laws that enable the government to seize property with unlawful origins  Mexico and Colombia both have specific laws that define the participation in criminal organizations as a separate crime  see Ley Federal contra la Delincuencia Organizada   and separate laws that allow the seizure of goods related with these crimes   see Ley de Extinción de Dominio   This latter provides a specific chapter titled  International Cooperation   which instructs Mexican authorities to cooperate with foreign authorities with respect to organized crime assets within Mexico  and provides the framework by which Mexican authorities may politely request the cooperation of foreign authorities with respect to assets located outside of Mexico  in terms of any international instruments they may be party to   Arguably  this may be construed as allowing the application of the RICO Act in Mexico  provided the relevant international agreements exist among Mexico and countries with RICO or RICO equivalent provisions   7  See also  Continuing Criminal Enterprise  Patriot Act
