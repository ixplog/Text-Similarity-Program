Enterobacteria phage λ  lambda phage  coliphage λ  is a bacterial virus  or bacteriophage  that infects the bacterial species Escherichia coli  E  coli   It was discovered by Esther Lederberg in 1950 when she noticed that streaks of mixtures of two E  coli strains  one of which treated with ultraviolet light  was  nibbled and plaqued   This virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a lytic phase  during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring    The phage particle consists of a head  also known as a capsid   a tail  and tail fibers  see image of virus below   The head contains the phage s double strand linear DNA genome  During infection  the phage particle recognizes and binds to its host  E  coli  causing DNA in the head of the phage to be ejected through the tail into the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell  Usually  a  lytic cycle  ensues  where the lambda DNA is replicated and new phage particles produced within the cell  This is followed by cell lysis  releasing the cell contents  including virions that have been assembled  into the environment  However  under certain conditions  the phage DNA may integrate itself into the host cell chromosome in the lysogenic pathway  In this state  the λ DNA is called a prophage and stays resident within the host s genome without apparent harm to the host  The host is termed a lysogen when a prophage is present  This prophage may enter the lytic cycle when the lysogen enters a stressed condition   1  Anatomy  The virus particle consists of a head and a tail that can have tail fibers  The whole particle consists of 12–14 different proteins with more than 1000 protein molecules total and one DNA molecule located in the phage head  However  it is still not entirely clear whether the L and M proteins are part of the virion   The genome contains 48 490 base pairs of double stranded  linear DNA  with 12 base single strand segments at both 5  ends  These two single stranded segments are the  sticky ends  of what is called the cos site  The cos site circularizes the DNA in the host cytoplasm  In its circular form  the phage genome  therefore  is 48 502 base pairs in length  The lambda genome can be inserted into the E  coli chromosome and is then called a prophage  See section below for details   2  Life cycle  2 1  Infection  Lambda phage is a non contractile tailed phage  meaning during an infection event it cannot  force  its DNA through a bacterial cell membrane  It must instead use an existing pathway to invade the host cell  having evolved the tip of its tail to interact with a specific pore to allow entry of its DNA to the hosts   Bacteriophage Lambda binds to an E  coli cell by means of its J protein in the tail tip  The J protein interacts with the maltose outer membrane porin  the product of the lamB gene  of E  coli  a porin molecule  which is part of the maltose operon   The linear phage genome is injected through the outer membrane   The DNA passes through the mannose permease complex in the inner membrane  encoded by the manXYZ genes  and immediately circularises using the cos sites  12 base G C rich cohesive  sticky ends   The single strand viral DNA ends are ligated by host DNA ligase   Host DNA gyrase puts negative supercoils in the circular chromosome  causing A T rich regions to unwind and drive transcription   Transcription starts from the constitutive PL  PR and PR M promoters producing the  immediate early  transcripts  At first  these express the N and cro genes  producing N  Cro and a short inactive protein   Cro binds to OR3  preventing access to the PRM promoter  preventing expression of the cI gene  N binds to the two Nut  N utilisation  sites  one in the N gene in the PL reading frame  and one in the cro gene in the PR reading frame   The N protein is an antiterminator  and functions to extend the reading frames to which it is bound  When RNA polymerase transcribes these regions  it recruits the N and forms a complex with several host Nus proteins  This complex skips through most termination sequences  The extended transcripts  the  late early  transcripts  include the N and cro genes along with cII and cIII genes  and xis  int  O  P and Q genes discussed later   The cIII protein acts to protect the cII protein from proteolysis by FtsH  a membrane bound essential E  coli protease  by acting as a competitive inhibitor  This inhibition can induce a bacteriostatic state  which favours lysogeny  cIII also directly stabilises the cII protein  On initial infection  the stability of cII determines the lifestyle of the phage  stable cII will lead to the lysogenic pathway  whereas if cII is degraded the phage will go into the lytic pathway  Low temperature  starvation of the cells and low multiplicity of infection  MOI  are known to favor lysogeny  see later discussion    2 1 1  N antitermination  This occurs without the N protein interacting with the DNA  the protein instead binds to the freshly transcribed mRNA  Nut sites contain 3 conserved  boxes   of which only BoxB is essential   The boxB RNA sequences are located close to the 5  end of the pL and pR transcripts  When transcribed  each sequence forms a hairpin loop structure that the N protein can bind to   N protein binds to boxB in each transcript  and contacts the transcribing RNA polymerase via RNA looping  The N RNAP complex is stabilized by subsequent binding of several host Nus  N utilisation substance  proteins  which include transcription termination antitermination factors and  bizarrely  a ribosome subunit    The entire complex  including the bound Nut site on the mRNA  continues transcription  and can skip through termination sequences   2 2  Lytic life cycle  This is the lifecycle that the phage follows following most infections  where the cII protein does not reach a high enough concentration due to degradation  so does not activate its promoters   The  late early  transcripts continue being written  including xis  int  Q and genes for replication of the lambda genome  OP   Cro dominates the repressor site  see  Repressor  section   repressing synthesis from the PRM promoter  which is a promoter of the lysogenic cycle    The O and P proteins initiate replication of the phage chromosome  see  Lytic Replication     Q  another antiterminator  binds to Qut sites   Transcription from the PR  promoter can now extend to produce mRNA for the lysis and the head and tail proteins   Structural proteins and phage genomes self assemble into new phage particles   Products of the lysis genes S R  Rz and Rz1 cause cell lysis  S is a holin  a small membrane protein that  at a time determined by the sequence of the protein  suddenly makes holes in the membrane  R is an endolysin  an enzyme that escapes through the S holes and cleaves the cell wall  Rz and Rz1 are membrane proteins that form a complex that somehow destroys the outer membrane  after the endolysin has degraded the cell wall  For wild type lambda  lysis occurs at about 50 minutes after the start of infection and releases around 100 virions   2 2 1  Rightward transcription  Rightward transcription expresses the O  P and Q genes  O and P are responsible for initiating replication  and Q is another antiterminator that allows the expression of head  tail  and lysis genes from PR’   2 2 1 1  Lytic replication  For the first few replication cycles  the lambda genome undergoes θ replication  circle to circle    This is initiated at the ori site located in the O gene  O protein binds the ori site  and P protein binds the DnaB subunit of the host replication machinery as well as binding O  This effectively commandeers the host DNA polymerase   Soon  the phage switches to a rolling circle replication similar to that used by phage M13  The DNA is nicked and the 3’ end serves as a primer  Note that this does not release single copies of the phage genome but rather one long molecule with many copies of the genome  a concatemer   These concatemers are cleaved at their cos sites as they are packaged  Packaging cannot occur from circular phage DNA  only from concatomeric DNA   2 2 1 2  Q antitermination  Q is similar to N in its effect  Q binds to RNA polymerase in Qut sites and the resulting complex can ignore terminators  however the mechanism is very different  the Q protein first associates with a DNA sequence rather than an mRNA sequence   The Qut site is very close to the PR’ promoter  close enough that the σ factor has not been released from the RNA polymerase holoenzyme  Part of the Qut site resembles the  10 Pribnow box  causing the holoenzyme to pause   Q protein then binds and displaces part of the σ factor and transcription re initiates   The head and tail genes are transcribed and the corresponding proteins self assemble   2 2 2  Leftward transcription  Leftward transcription expresses the gam  red  xis  and int genes  Gam and red proteins are involved in recombination  Gam is also important in that it inhibits the host RecBCD nuclease from degrading the 3’ ends in rolling circle replication  Int and xis are integration and excision proteins vital to lysogeny   2 2 2 1  xis and int regulation of insertion and excision  xis and int are found on the same piece of mRNA  so approximately equal concentrations of xis and int proteins are produced  This results  initially  in the excision of any inserted genomes from the host genome   The mRNA from the PL promoter forms a stable secondary structure with a stem loop in the sib section of the mRNA  This targets the 3   sib  end of the mRNA for RNAaseIII degradation  which results in a lower effective concentration of int mRNA than xis mRNA  as the int cistron is nearer to the sib sequence than the xis cistron is to the sib sequence   so a higher concentrations of xis than int is observed   Higher concentrations of xis than int result in no insertion or excision of phage genomes  the evolutionarily favoured action   leaving any pre insterted phage genomes inserted  so reducing competition  and preventing the insertion of the phage genome into the genome of a doomed host   2 3  Lysogenic  or lysenogenic  life cycle  The lysogenic lifecycle begins once the cII protein reaches a high enough concentration to activate its promoters  after a small number of infections   The  late early  transcripts continue being written  including xis  int  Q and genes for replication of the lambda genome   The stabilized cII acts to promote transcription from the PRE  PI and Pantiq promoters   The Pantiq promoter produces antisense mRNA to the Q gene message of the PR promoter transcript  thereby switching off Q production  The PRE promoter produces antisense mRNA to the cro section of the PR promoter transcript  turning down cro production  and has a transcript of the cI gene  This is expressed  turning on cI repressor production  The PI promoter expresses the int gene  resulting in high concentrations of int protein  This int protein integrates the phage DNA into the host chromosome  see  Prophage Integration     No Q results in no extension of the PR  promoter s reading frame  so no lytic or structural proteins are made  Elevated levels of int  much higher than that of xis  result in the insertion of the lambda genome into the hosts genome  see diagram   Production of cI leads to the binding of cI to the OR1 and OR2 sites in the PR promoter  turning off cro and other early gene expression  cI also binds to the PL promoter  turning off transcription there too   Lack of cro leaves the OR3 site unbound  so transcription from the PRM promoter may occur  maintaining levels of cI   Lack of transcription from the PL and PR promoters leads to no further production of cII and cIII   As cII and cIII concentrations decrease  transcription from the Pantiq  PRE and PI stop being promoted since they are no longer needed   Only the PRM and PR  promoters are left active  the former producing cI protein and the latter a short inactive transcript  The genome remains inserted into the host genome in a dormant state  The prophage is duplicated with every subsequent cell division of the host  The phage genes expressed in this dormant state code for proteins that repress expression of other phage genes  such as the structural and lysis genes  in order to prevent entry into the lytic cycle  These repressive proteins are broken down when the host cell is under stress  resulting in the expression of the repressed phage genes  Stress can be from starvation  poisons  like antibiotics   or other factors that can damage or destroy the host  In response to stress  the activated prophage is excised from the DNA of the host cell by one of the newly expressed gene products and enters its lytic pathway   2 3 1  Prophage integration  The integration of phage λ takes place at a special attachment site in the bacterial and phage genomes  called attλ  The sequence of the bacterial att site is called attB  between the gal and bio operons  and consists of the parts B O B   whereas the complementary sequence in the circular phage genome is called attP and consists of the parts P O P   The integration itself is a sequential exchange  see genetic recombination  via a Holliday junction and requires both the phage protein Int and the bacterial protein IHF  integration host factor   Both Int and IHF bind to attP and form an intasome  a DNA protein complex designed for site specific recombination of the phage and host DNA  The original B O B  sequence is changed by the integration to B O P  phage DNA P O B   The phage DNA is now part of the host s genome   2 3 2  Maintenance of lysogeny  Lysogeny is maintained solely by cI  cI represses transcription from PL and PR while upregulating and controlling its own expression from PRM  It is therefore the only protein expressed by lysogenic phage   This is coordinated by the PL and PR operators  Both operators have three binding sites for cI  OL1  OL2  and OL3 for PL  and OR1  OR2 and OR3 for PR   cI binds most favorably to OR1  binding here inhibits transcription from PR  As cI easily dimerises  the binding of cI to OR1 greatly increases the affinity of the binding of cI to OR2  and this happens almost immediately after OR1 binding  This activates transcription in the other direction from PRM  as the N terminal domain of cI on OR2 tightens the binding of RNA polymerase to PRM and hence cI stimulates its own transcription  When it is present at a much higher concentration  it also binds to OR3  inhibiting transcription from PRM  thus regulating its own levels in a negative feedback loop   cI binding to the PL operator is very similar  except that it has no direct effect on cI transcription  As an additional repression of its own expression  however  cI dimers bound to OR3 and OL3 bend the DNA between them to tetramerise   The presence of cI causes immunity to superinfection by other lambda phages  as it will inhibit their PL and PR promoters   2 3 3  Induction  The classic induction of a lysogen involved irradiating the infected cells with UV light  Any situation where a lysogen undergoes DNA damage or the SOS response of the host is otherwise stimulated leads to induction   The host cell  containing a dormant phage genome  experiences DNA damage due to a high stress environment  and starts to undergo the SOS response   RecA  a cellular protein  detects DNA damage and becomes activated  It is now RecA*  a highly specific co protease   Normally RecA* binds LexA  a transcription repressor   activating LexA auto protease activity  which destroys LexA repressor  allowing production of DNA repair proteins  In lysogenic cells  this response is hijacked  and RecA* stimulates cI autocleavage  This is because cI mimics the structure of LexA at the autocleavage site   Cleaved cI can no longer dimerise  and loses its affinity for DNA binding   The PR and PL promoters are no longer repressed and switch on  and the cell returns to the lytic sequence of expression events  note that cII is not stable in cells undergoing the SOS response   There is however one notable difference   2 3 3 1  Control of phage genome excision in induction  The phage genome is still inserted in the host genome and needs excision for DNA replication to occur  The sib section beyond the normal PL promoter transcript is  however  no longer included in this reading frame  see diagram    No sib domain on the PL promoter mRNA results in no hairpin loop on the 3  end  and the transcript is no longer targeted for RNAaseIII degradation   The new intact transcript has one copy of both xis and int  so approximately equal concentrations of xis and int proteins are produced   Equal concentrations of xis and int result in the excision of the inserted genome from the host genome for replication and later phage production   3  Multiplicity reactivation and prophage reactivation  Multiplicity reactivation  MR  is the process by which multiple viral genomes  each containing inactivating genome damage  interact within an infected cell to form a viable viral genome  MR was originally discovered with phage T4  but was subsequently found in phage λ  as well as in numerous other bacterial and mammalian viruses   MR of phage λ inactivated by UV light depends on the recombination function of either the host or of the infecting phage  Absence of both recombination systems leads to a loss of MR   Survival of UV irradiated phage λ is increased when the E  coli host is lysogenic for an homologous prophage  a phenomenon termed prophage reactivation  Prophage reactivation in phage λ appears to occur by a recombinational repair process similar to that of MR   4  Repressor  The repressor found in the phage lambda is a notable example of the level of control possible over gene expression by a very simple system  It forms a  binary switch  with two genes under mutually exclusive expression  as discovered by Barbara J  Meyer   The lambda repressor gene system consists of  from left to right on the chromosome    cI gene  OR3  OR2  OR1  cro gene The lambda repressor is a self assembling dimer also known as the cI protein  It binds DNA in the helix turn helix binding motif  It regulates the transcription of the cI protein and the Cro protein   The life cycle of lambda phages is controlled by cI and Cro proteins  The lambda phage will remain in the lysogenic state if cI proteins predominate  but will be transformed into the lytic cycle if cro proteins predominate   The cI dimer may bind to any of three operators  OR1  OR2  and OR3  in the order OR1   OR2   OR3  Binding of a cI dimer to OR1 enhances binding of a second cI dimer to OR2  an effect called cooperativity  Thus  OR1 and OR2 are almost always simultaneously occupied by cI  However  this does not increase the affinity between cI and OR3  which will be occupied only when the cI concentration is high   At high concentrations of cI  the dimers will also bind to operators OL1 and OL2  which are over 2 kb downstream from the R operators   When cI dimers are bound to OL1  OL2  OR1  and OR2 a loop is induced in the DNA  allowing these dimers to bind together to form an octamer  This is a phenomenon called long range cooperativity  Upon formation of the octamer  cI dimers may cooperatively bind to OL3 and OR3  repressing transcription of cI  This autonegative regulation ensures a stable minimum concentration of the repressor molecule and  should SOS signals arise  allows for more efficient prophage induction   In the absence of cI proteins  the cro gene may be transcribed   In the presence of cI proteins  only the cI gene may be transcribed   At high concentration of cI  transcriptions of both genes are repressed   5  Protein function overview  6  Lytic or lysogenic   An important distinction here is that between the two decisions  lysogeny and lysis on infection  and continuing lysogeny or lysis from a prophage  The latter is determined solely by the activation of RecA in the SOS response of the cell  as detailed in the section on induction  The former will also be affected by this  a cell undergoing an SOS response will always be lysed  as no cI protein will be allowed to build up  However  the initial lytic lysogenic decision on infection is also dependent on the cII and cIII proteins   In cells with sufficient nutrients  protease activity is high  which breaks down cII  This leads to the lytic lifestyle  In cells with limited nutrients  protease activity is low  making cII stable  This leads to the lysogenic lifestyle  cIII appears to stabilize cII  both directly and by acting as a competitive inhibitor to the relevant proteases  This means that a cell  in trouble   i e  lacking in nutrients and in a more dormant state  is more likely to lysogenise  This would be selected for because the phage can now lie dormant in the bacterium until it falls on better times  and so the phage can create more copies of itself with the additional resources available and with the more likely proximity of further infectable cells   A full biophysical model for lambda s lysis lysogeny decision remains to be developed  Computer modeling and simulation suggest that random processes during infection drive the selection of lysis or lysogeny within individual cells  However  recent experiments suggest that physical differences among cells  that exist prior to infection  predetermine whether a cell will lyse or become a lysogen   7  Lambda as a genetic tool  Lambda phage has been used heavily as a model organism  and has been a rich source for useful tools in microbial genetics  and later in molecular genetics  Uses include its application as a vector for the cloning of recombinant DNA  the use of its site specific recombinase  int  for the shuffling of cloned DNAs by the gateway method  and the application of its Red operon  including the proteins Red alpha  also called  exo    beta and gamma in the DNA engineering method called recombineering  Lambda phage has also been of major importance in the study of specialized transduction   8  See also  Molecular weight size marker  from MIT showing both lysis and lysogeny by
