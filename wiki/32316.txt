The unary numeral system is the bijective base 1 numeral system  It is the simplest numeral system to represent natural numbers  in order to represent a number N  an arbitrarily chosen symbol representing 1 is repeated N times   This system is used in tallying  For example  using the tally mark    the number 6 is represented as         In East Asian cultures  the number three is represented as “三”  a character that is drawn with three strokes   1  Operations  Addition and subtraction are particularly simple in the unary system  as they involve little more than string concatenation  The Hamming weight or population count operation that counts the number of nonzero bits in a sequence of binary values may also be interpreted as a conversion from unary to binary numbers  Multiplication and division are more cumbersome  however   2  Complexity  Compared to standard positional numeral systems  the unary system is inconvenient and is not used in practice for large calculations  It occurs in some decision problem descriptions in theoretical computer science  e g  some P complete problems   where it is used to  artificially  decrease the run time or space requirements of a problem  For instance  the problem of integer factorization is suspected to require more than a polynomial function of the length of the input as run time if the input is given in binary  but it only needs linear runtime if the input is presented in unary  But this is potentially misleading  using a unary input is slower for any given number  not faster  the distinction is that a binary  or larger base  input is proportional to the base 2  or larger base  logarithm of the number while unary input is proportional to the number itself  so while the run time and space requirement in unary looks better as function of the input size  it is a worse function of the number that the input represents   In computational complexity theory  unary numbering is used to distinguish strongly NP complete problems from problems that are NP complete but not strongly NP complete  A problem in which the input includes some numerical parameters is strongly NP complete if it remains NP complete even when the size of the input is made artificially larger by representing the parameters in unary  For such a problem  there exist hard instances for which all parameter values are at most polynomially large   3  Applications  In some cultures it is traditional to decorate a birthday cake using the unary system with candles to represent age  This exploits the unique property of the system that there is no requirement for any ordering of the symbols  that is  the age can be read from the candles regardless of how they are arranged on the cake    Unary is used as part of some data compression algorithms such as Golomb coding   4  See also  Tally marks  Church numeral  5  References  6  External links
