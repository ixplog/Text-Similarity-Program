In geography  an oasis  plural  oases  or cienega  Southwestern United States  is an isolated area of vegetation in a desert  typically surrounding a spring or similar water source  Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough  The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas  caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished  Thus  political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route  For example  the oases of Awjila  Ghadames  and Kufra  situated in modern day Libya  have at various times been vital to both North South and East West trade in the Sahara Desert   Oases are formed from underground rivers or aquifers such as an artesian aquifer  where water can reach the surface naturally by pressure or by man made wells  Occasional brief thunderstorms provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases  such as the Tuat  Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets  or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface  Any incidence of water is then used by migrating birds  which also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water s edge forming an oasis   1  Etymology  The word oasis comes into English via from   which in turn is a direct borrowing from Demotic Egyptian  The word for oasis in the later attested Coptic language  the descendant of Demotic Egyptian  is wahe or ouahe which means a  dwelling place    2  Growing plants  People who live in an oasis must manage land and water use carefully  fields must be irrigated to grow plants like apricots  dates  figs  and olives  The most important plant in an oasis is the date palm  which forms the upper layer  These palm trees provide shade for smaller trees like peach trees  which form the middle layer  By growing plants in different layers  the farmers make best use of the soil and water  Many vegetables are also grown and some cereals  such as barley  millet  and wheat  where there is more moisture   3  Notable oases  3 1  Africa  3 1 1  Algeria  M Zab Valley  Ouargla  Timimoun  Tuat  3 1 2  Egypt  Bahariya Oasis  Dakhla Oasis  Faiyum Oasis  Farafra Oasis  Kharga Oasis  Qara Oasis  Siwa Oasis  3 1 3  Libya  Al Jaghbub Oasis  Kufra Oasis  Oasis of Ghat  3 1 4  Morocco  Tafilalt  3 1 5  Tunisia  Tozeur  3 2  Asia  3 2 1  Middle East  Al Hasa  the largest in Asia  Saudi Arabia  Al Qatif  Saudi Arabia  Azraq  Jordan  Ein Gedi  Israel  Liwa Oasis  United Arab Emirates  Tabas  Iran  3 2 2  China  Loulan  Miran  Niya  Turpan  Yarkand  3 3  Australia  Palm Valley  Northern Territory  3 4  North America and South America  3 4 1  Mexico  Mulege  Baja California Sur  San Ignacio  Baja California Sur  3 4 2  Peru  Huacachina  3 4 3  United States  Balmorhea State Park  Texas  Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge  Utah  La Cienega  New Mexico  a paraje on El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro  Las Vegas Valley  Nevada  what was once an oasis in the vast Mojave desert has over the years grown into a metropolitan area   Post Park  Texas  Twentynine Palms  California  Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge  Nevada  Warm Springs Natural Area  Nevada  4  See also  Great Manmade River 舑 the world s largest irrigation project  developed in Libya to connect cities with fossil water  Guelta  Mirage  Oasification  Qanat  5  References  6  Bibliography   référence  Jardins au désert  Vincent Battesti  Battesti  Vincent   Jardins au désert  Evolution des pratiques et savoirs oasiens  Jérid tunisien  Paris  Éditions IRD  coll  À travers champs  2005  440 p  ISBN 2 7099 1564 2  7  External links
