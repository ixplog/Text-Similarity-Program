Sweden  It was conceived by Swedish architect Sven Markelius  one of the 11 architects in the international team that designed the UN headquarters  Wood from Swedish pine trees was used in the delegates  area for the railings and doors   The pipes and ducts in the ceiling above the public gallery were deliberately left exposed  the architect believed that anything useful could be left uncovered  The  unfinished  ceiling is a symbolic reminder that the economic and social work of the United Nations is never finished  there will always be something more which can be done to improve living conditions for the world s people   2  President  The current president of the ECOSOC is ambassador Martin Sajdik of the Republic of Austria  The president is elected for a one year term and

spending nearly USD 2 trillion on green technologies to prevent what it termed “a major planetary catastrophe”  warning that  It is rapidly expanding energy use  mainly driven by fossil fuels  that explains why humanity is on the verge of breaching planetary sustainability boundaries through global warming  biodiversity loss  and disturbance of the nitrogen cycle balance and other measures of the sustainability of the earth’s ecosystem”   UN secretary general Ban Ki moon added  “Rather than viewing growth and sustainability as competing goals on a collision course  we must see them as complementary and mutually supportive imperatives   The report concluded that  Business as usual is not an option    8  Reform of the Economic and Social Council  Governance of the multilateral system has historically been complex and fragmented  This has limited the capacity of the ECOSOC to influence international policies in trade  finance and investment  Reform proposals aim to enhance the relevance and contribution of the council  A major reform was approved by the 2005 World Summit on the basis of proposals submitted by secretary general Kofi Annan  The Summit aimed to establish the ECOSOC as a quality platform for high level engagement among member states and with international financial institutions  the private sector and civil society on global trends  policies and action  It was decided to hold biennial high level Development Cooperation Forums at the national leadership level by transforming the high level segment of the Council to review trends in international development cooperation and promote greater coherence in development activities  At the Summit it was also decided to hold annual ministerial level substantive reviews to assess progress in achieving internationally agreed development goals  particularly the Millennium Development Goals   Subsequent proposals by the High Level Panel Report on System Wide Coherence in November 2006 aimed to establish a forum within the ECOSOC as a counter model to the exclusive clubs of the G8 and G20  The Forum was to comprise 27 heads of state  L27  corresponding to half of the ECOSOC membership  to meet annually and provide international leadership in the development area  This proposal  however  was not approved by the General Assembly   9  See also  Consultative Status  List of organizations
