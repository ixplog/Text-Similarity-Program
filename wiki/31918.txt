as a Baptist sponsored institution  The impetus to form the university came primarily from the town of Hamilton  New York  which has been home to Colgate University since 1819  In 1848  the Baptist Education Society planned to move Colgate University  then known as Madison University  to the city of Rochester  but was halted by legal action  Dissenting Colgate trustees  faculty  and students founded the University of Rochester  receiving a charter from the Regents of the University of the State of New York on January 31  1850  Classes began that November  with approximately 60 students enrolling  including 28 transfers from Madison   The University of Rochester s campus was originally in downtown Rochester at the United States Hotel  which was located on Buffalo Street near Elizabeth Street  which today is West Main Street near the I 490 overpass  In 1853  the campus moved east to a then suburban location on what is now University Avenue  Local businessman and Congressman Azariah Boody donated of land for the new campus  and the University purchased a further from him  UR would remain on this campus until the current River Campus was constructed in 1930  and the university continues to own a small part of the University Avenue campus  where the university owned Memorial Art Gallery is located    The first female students were admitted in 1900  the result of an effort led by Susan B  Anthony and Helen Barrett Montgomery  During the 1890s  a number of women took classes and labs at the university as  visitors  but were not officially enrolled nor were their records included in the college register  President David Jayne Hill allowed the first woman  Helen E  Wilkinson  to enroll as a normal student  although she was not allowed to matriculate or to pursue a degree  Thirty three women enrolled among the first class in 1900  and Ella S  Wilcoxen was the first to receive a degree  in 1901  When the River Campus was completed in 1930  male students moved there while the female students remained on the University Avenue campus until 1955   Major growth occurred under the leadership of Rush Rhees  during his 1900 1935 tenure  During this time  George Eastman became a major donor  giving more than $50 million to the university  The first Ph D  was awarded in 1925  In 1955  the separate colleges for men and women were merged into The College  In 1958  three new schools were created in engineering  business administration  and education   During World War II  Rochester was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V 12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission  Between 1946 and 1947  in infamous uranium experiments researchers at the university injected uranium 234 and uranium 235 into six people to study how much uranium their kidneys could tolerate before becoming damaged   In the mid 1980s  the University commissioned a study to determine if the name of the institution should be changed  most likely to  Eastman University   The study concluded that a name change could be beneficial because the use of a place name in the title led respondents to incorrectly believe that it was a public university  and because the name  Rochester  connoted a  cold and distant outpost   Reports of the latter conclusion led to controversy and criticism in the Rochester community  Ultimately  the name  University of Rochester  was retained   In 1995  university president Thomas H  Jackson announced the launch of a  Renaissance Plan  for The College that  among several changes  reduced enrollment and created a more selective admissions process  The plan also revised the undergraduate curriculum significantly  creating the current system with only one required course and only a few distribution requirements  known as  clusters     2  Administration  The university is headed by a board of trustees  with Edmund A  Hajim being the chairman  The board
