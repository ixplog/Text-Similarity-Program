 The Star Spangled Banner  is the national anthem of the United States  The lyrics come from  Defence of Fort M Henry   a poem written in 1814 by the 35 year old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in the Chesapeake Bay during the Battle of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812   The poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society  a men s social club in London   To Anacreon in Heaven   or  The Anacreontic Song    with various lyrics  was already popular in the United States  Set to Key s poem and renamed  The Star Spangled Banner   it would soon become a well known American patriotic song  With a range of one octave and one fifth  a semitone more than an octave and a half   it is known for being difficult to sing  Although the poem has four stanzas  only the first is commonly sung today    The Star Spangled Banner  was recognized for official use by the Navy in 1889  and by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916  and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3  1931  46 Stat  1508  codified at    which was signed by President Herbert Hoover   Before 1931  other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom   Hail  Columbia  served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century   My Country   Tis of Thee   whose melody is identical to  God Save the Queen   the British national anthem  also served as a de facto anthem  Following the War of 1812 and subsequent American wars  other songs emerged to compete for popularity at public events  among them  The Star Spangled Banner    1  Early history  1 1  Francis Scott Key s lyrics  On September 3  1814  following the Burning of Washington and the Raid on Alexandria  Francis Scott Key and John Stuart Skinner set sail from Baltimore aboard the ship HMS Minden  flying a flag of truce on a mission approved by President James Madison  Their objective was to secure the exchange of prisoners  one of whom was Dr  William Beanes  the elderly and popular town physician of Upper Marlboro and a friend of Key s who had been captured in his home  Beanes was accused of aiding the arrest of British soldiers  Key and Skinner boarded the British flagship HMS Tonnant on September 7 and spoke with Major General Robert Ross and Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane over dinner while the two officers discussed war plans  At first  Ross and Cochrane refused to release Beanes  but relented after Key and Skinner showed them letters written by wounded British prisoners praising Beanes and other Americans for their kind treatment   Because Key and Skinner had heard details of the plans for the attack on Baltimore  they were held captive until after the battle  first aboard HMS Surprise and later back on HMS Minden  After the bombardment  certain British gunboats attempted to slip past the fort and effect a landing in a cove to the west of it  but they were turned away by fire from nearby Fort Covington  the city s last line of defense   During the rainy night  Key had witnessed the bombardment and observed that the fort s smaller  storm flag  continued to fly  but once the shell and Congreve rocket barrage had stopped  he would not know how the battle had turned out until dawn  On the morning of September 14  the storm flag had been lowered and the larger flag had been raised   During the bombardment  provided the  rockets  red glare   HMS Meteor provided at least some of the  bombs bursting in air    Key was inspired by the American victory and the sight of the large American flag flying triumphantly above the fort  This flag  with fifteen stars and fifteen stripes  had been made by Mary Young Pickersgill together with other workers in her home on Baltimore s Pratt Street  The flag later came to be known as the Star Spangled Banner Flag and is today on display in the National Museum of American History  a treasure of the Smithsonian Institution  It was restored in 1914 by Amelia Fowler  and again in 1998 as part of an ongoing conservation program   Aboard the ship the next day  Key wrote a poem on the back of a letter he had kept in his pocket  At twilight on September 16  he and Skinner were released in Baltimore  He completed the poem at the Indian Queen Hotel  where he was staying  and titled it  Defence of Fort M Henry    Much of the idea of the poem  including the flag imagery and some of the wording  is derived from an earlier song by Key  also set to the tune of The Anacreontic Song  The song  known as  When the Warrior Returns   was written in honor of Stephen Decatur and Charles Stewart on their return from the First Barbary War   According to the historian Robin Blackburn  the words  the hireling and slave  allude to the fact that the British attackers had many ex slaves in their ranks  who had been promised liberty and demanded to be placed in the battle line  where they might expect to meet their former masters    1 2  John Stafford Smith s music  Key gave the poem to his brother in law Judge Joseph H  Nicholson who saw that the words fit the popular melody  The Anacreontic Song   by English composer John Stafford Smith  This was the official song of the Anacreontic Society  an 18th century gentlemen s club of amateur musicians in London  Nicholson took the poem to a printer in Baltimore  who anonymously made the first known broadside printing on September 17  of these  two known copies survive   On September 20  both the Baltimore Patriot and The American printed the song  with the note  Tune  Anacreon in Heaven   The song quickly became popular  with seventeen newspapers from Georgia to New Hampshire printing it  Soon after  Thomas Carr of the Carr Music Store in Baltimore published the words and music together under the title  The Star Spangled Banner   although it was originally called  Defence of Fort M‘Henry   The song s popularity increased  and its first public performance took place in October  when Baltimore actor Ferdinand Durang sang it at Captain McCauley s tavern  Washington Irving  then editor of The Analectic Magazine in Philadelphia  reprinted the song in November 1814   By the early 20th century  there were various versions of the song in popular use  Seeking a singular  standard version  President Woodrow Wilson tasked the U S  Bureau of Education with providing that official version  In response  the Bureau enlisted the help of five musicians to agree upon an arrangement  Those musicians were Walter Damrosch  Will Earhart  Arnold J  Gantvoort  Oscar Sonneck and John Philip Sousa  The standardized version that was voted upon by these five musicians premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 5  1917  in a program that included Edward Elgar s Carillon and Gabriel Pierné s The Children s Crusade  The concert was put on by the Oratorio Society of New York and conducted by Walter Damrosch  An official handwritten version of the final votes of these five men has been found and shows all five men s votes tallied  measure by measure   The Italian opera composer Giacomo Puccini used an extract of the melody to write the aria  Dovunque al mondo      in 1904 for his work Madama Butterfly   1 3  National anthem  The song gained popularity throughout the 19th century and bands played it during public events  such as July 4th celebrations  On July 27  1889  Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F  Tracy signed General Order #374  making  The Star Spangled Banner  the official tune to be played at the raising of the flag   In 1916  President Woodrow Wilson ordered that  The Star Spangled Banner  be played at military and other appropriate occasions  The playing of the song two years later during the seventh inning stretch of Game One of the 1918 World Series  and thereafter during each game of the series is often cited as the first instance that the anthem was played at a baseball game  though evidence shows that the  Star Spangled Banner  was performed as early as 1897 at opening day ceremonies in Philadelphia and then more regularly at the Polo Grounds in New York City beginning in 1898  In any case  the tradition of performing the national anthem before every baseball game began in World War II   On November 3  1929  Robert Ripley drew a panel in his syndicated cartoon  Ripley s Believe it or Not   saying  Believe It or Not  America has no national anthem   In 1931  John Philip Sousa published his opinion in favor  stating that  it is the spirit of the music that inspires  as much as it is Key s  soul stirring  words  By a law signed on March 3  1931 by President Herbert Hoover   The Star Spangled Banner  was adopted as the national anthem of the United States of America   2  Lyrics  2 1  Additional Civil War period lyrics  In indignation over the start of the American Civil War  Oliver Wendell Holmes  Sr  added a fifth stanza to the song in 1861 which appeared in songbooks of the era   When our land is illumined with Liberty s smile  If a foe from within strike a blow at her glory  Down  down with the traitor that dares to defile The flag of her stars and the page of her glory  By the millions unchained who our birthright have gained  We will keep her bright blazon forever unstained  And the Star Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave While the land of the free is the home of the brave   2 2  Alternative lyrics  In a version hand written by Francis Scott Key in 1840  the third line reads  Whose bright stars and broad stripes  through the clouds of the fight    3  Modern history  3 1  Performances  The song is notoriously difficult for nonprofessionals to sing because of its wide rangea 12th  Humorist Richard Armour referred to the song s difficulty in his book It All Started With Columbus   Professional and amateur singers have been known to forget the words  which is one reason the song is sometimes pre recorded and lip synced  Other times the issue is avoided by having the performer s  play the anthem instrumentally instead of singing it  The pre recording of the anthem has become standard practice at some ballparks  such as Boston s Fenway Park  according to the SABR publication The Fenway Project    The Star Spangled Banner  is traditionally played at the beginning of public sports events and orchestral concerts in the United States  as well as other public gatherings  Performances at particularly large events are often ended with a military flypast  but have also featured Challenger the eagle flying over the stadium before landing on his handler s gloved hand  The NHL requires arenas in both the U S  and Canada to perform both the Canadian and American national anthems at games that involve teams from both countries  and it is usual for both American and Canadian anthems  with the  away  anthem first  to be played at Major League Baseball  Major League Soccer  and National Basketball Association games involving the Toronto Blue Jays  Toronto FC  Vancouver Whitecaps  Montreal Impact  and the Toronto Raptors  the only Canadian MLB  MLS  and NBA teams  respectively  The Buffalo Sabres of the NHL  which play in a city on the Canadian border and have a substantial Canadian fan base  play both anthems before all home games regardless of where the visiting team is based   Two especially unusual performances of the song took place in the immediate aftermath of the United States September 11 attacks  On September 12  2001  the Queen broke with tradition and allowed the Band of the Coldstream Guards to perform the anthem at Buckingham Palace  London at the ceremonial Changing of the Guard  as a gesture of support for Britain s ally  The following day at a St  Paul s Cathedral memorial service  the Queen joined in the singing of the anthem  an unprecedented occurrence   3 2  200th Anniversary Celebrations  The 200th Anniversary of the Star Spangled Banner occurred in 2014 with various special events occurring throughout the United States  A particularly significant celebration occurred during the week of September 10–16 in and around Baltimore  Maryland  Highlights included playing of a new arrangement of the Anthem arranged by John Williams and participation of President Obama on Defender s Day  September 12  2014  at Fort McHenry  In addition  the Anthem Bicentennial included a youth music celebration including the presentation of the National Anthem Bicentennial Youth Challenge winning composition written by Noah Altshuler   3 3  Adaptations  The first popular music performance of the anthem heard by mainstream America was by Puerto Rican singer and guitarist José Feliciano  He created a nationwide uproar when he strummed a slow  blues style rendition of the song at Tiger Stadium in Detroit before game five of the 1968 World Series  between Detroit and St  Louis  This rendition started contemporary  Star Spangled Banner  controversies  The response from many in Vietnam era America was generally negative  given that 1968 was a tumultuous year for the United States  Despite the controversy  Feliciano s performance opened the door for the countless interpretations of the  Star Spangled Banner  heard in the years since  One week after Feliciano s performance  the anthem was in the news again when American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos lifted controversial raised fists at the 1968 Olympics while the  Star Spangled Banner  played at a medal ceremony   Marvin Gaye gave a soul influenced performance at the 1983 NBA All Star Game and Whitney Houston gave a soulful rendition before Super Bowl XXV in 1991  which was released as a single that charted at number 20 in 1991 and number 6 in 2001  along with José Feliciano  the only times the anthem has been on the Billboard Hot 100   In 1993  Kiss did an instrumental rock version as the closing track on their album  Alive III  Another famous instrumental interpretation is Jimi Hendrix s version which was a set list staple from autumn 1968 until his death in September 1970  including a famous rendition at the Woodstock music festival in 1969  Incorporating sonic effects to emphasize the  rockets  red glare   and  bombs bursting in air   it became a late 1960s emblem  Roseanne Barr gave a controversial performance of the anthem at a San Diego Padres baseball game at Jack Murphy Stadium on July 25  1990  The comedienne belted out a screechy rendition of the song  and afterward she attempted a gesture of ball players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup  The performance offended some  including the sitting U S  President  Sufjan Stevens has frequently performed the  Star Spangled Banner  in live sets  replacing the optimism in the end of the first verse with a new coda which alludes to the divisive state of the nation today  David Lee Roth both referenced to parts of the anthem and played part of a hard rock rendition of the anthem on his song   Yankee Rose  on his 1986 solo album  Eat  Em and Smile  Steven Tyler also caused some controversy in 2001  at the Indianapolis 500  to which he later issued a public apology  and again in 2012  at the AFC Championship Game  with a cappella renditions of the song with changed lyrics  A version of Aerosmith s Joe Perry and Brad Whitford playing part of the song can be heard at the end of their version of  Train Kept A Rollin   on the Rockin  the Joint album  The band Boston gave an instrumental rock rendition of the anthem on their Greatest Hits album  The band Crush 40 made a version of the song as opening track from the album Thrill of the Feel  2000    In March 2005  a government sponsored program  the National Anthem Project  was launched after a Harris Interactive poll showed many adults knew neither the lyrics nor the history of the anthem   4  References in film  television  literature  Several films have their titles taken from the song s lyrics  These include two films titled Dawn s Early Light  2000 and 2005   two made for TV features titled By Dawn s Early Light  1990 and 2000   two films titled So Proudly We Hail  1943 and 1990   a feature  1977  and a short  2005  titled Twilight s Last Gleaming  and four films titled Home of the Brave  1949  1986  2004  and 2006    The Isaac Asimov short story  No Refuge Could Save  takes its title from a line in the third stanza  In the story  the protagonist notes that he once ferreted out a German spy during World War II because of the spy s knowledge of the third verse  which is virtually unknown by Americans   Ken Burns  documentary Baseball consists of 9  innings   each of which begins with a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner that is historically appropriate for the period covered in that episode of the series   5  Custom  United States Code    states that during a rendition of the national anthem  when the flag is displayed  all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart  Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present and not in uniform may render the military salute  men not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the left shoulder  the hand being over the heart  and individuals in uniform should give the military salute at the first note of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note  and when the flag is not displayed  all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed  Military law requires all vehicles on the installation to stop when the song is played and all individuals outside to stand at attention and face the direction of the music and either salute  in uniform  or place the right hand over the heart  if out of uniform  Recently enacted law in 2008 allows military veterans to salute out of uniform  as well   However  this statutory suggestion does not have any penalty associated with violations  This behavioral requirement for the national anthem is subject to the same First Amendment controversies that surround the Pledge of Allegiance  For example  Jehovah s Witnesses do not sing the national anthem  though they are taught that standing is an  ethical decision  that individual believers must make based on their  conscience    6  Translations  As a result of immigration to the United States and the incorporation of non English speaking people into the country  the lyrics of the song have been translated into other languages  In 1861  it was translated into German  The Library of Congress also has record of a Spanish language version from 1919  It has since been translated into Hebrew and Yiddish by Jewish immigrants  Latin American Spanish  with one version popularized during immigration reform protests in 2006   French by Acadians of Louisiana  Samoan  and Irish  The third verse of the anthem has also been translated into Latin   With regard to the indigenous languages of North America  there are versions in Navajo and Cherokee   7  Media  8  See also  9  References  10  Further reading  Ferris  Marc
