Riboflavin  vitamin B2  is part of the vitamin B group  It is the central component of the cofactors FAD and FMN and as such required for a variety of flavoprotein enzyme reactions including activation of other vitamins  It was formerly known as vitamin G   Riboflavin is a yellow orange solid substance with poor solubility in water  It is best known visually as it imparts the color to vitamin supplements and the yellow color to the urine of persons taking it   The name  riboflavin  comes from  ribose   the sugar whose reduced form  ribitol  forms part of its structure  and  flavin   the ring moiety which imparts the yellow color to the oxidized molecule  from Latin flavus   yellow    The reduced form  which occurs in metabolism along with the oxidized form  is colorless   1  Function  The active forms Flavin mononucleotide  FMN  and flavin adenine dinucleotide  FAD  function as cofactors for a variety of flavoproteine enzyme reactions   Flavoproteins of electron transport chain  Decarboxylation of pyruvate and ketoglutarate requires FAD  Fatty acyl CoA dehydrogenase requires FAD in fatty acid oxidation  FAD is required to the production of pyridoxic acid from pyridoxal  vitamin B6   The primary coenzyme form of vitamin B6  pyridoxal phosphate  is FMN dependent  FAD is required to convert retinol  vitamin A  to retinoic acid  Synthesis of an active form of folate  5 methyl THF  is FADH2 dependent  FAD is required to convert tryptophan to niacin  vitamin B3   Reduction of the oxidized form of glutathione  GSSG  to its reduced form  GSH  is FAD dependent For the molecular mechanism of action see main articles Flavin mononucleotide  FMN  and flavin adenine dinucleotide  FAD   2  Nutrition  2 1  Food sources  Sources of riboflavin are milk  cheese  leaf vegetables  liver  kidneys  legumes  yeast  mushrooms  and almonds   Yeast extract is considered to be exceptionally rich in vitamin B2  Cereals contain relatively low concentrations of flavins  but are important sources in those parts of the world where cereals constitute the staple diet   The milling of cereals results in considerable loss  up to 60%  of vitamin B2  so white flour is enriched in some countries such as USA by addition of the vitamin  The enrichment of bread and ready to eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of vitamin B2  Polished rice is not usually enriched  because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice consumption populations  However  most of the flavin content of whole brown rice is retained if the rice is steamed  parboiled  prior to milling  This process drives the flavins in the germ and aleurone layers into the endosperm  Free riboflavin is naturally present in foods along with protein bound FMN and FAD  Bovine milk contains mainly free riboflavin  with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD  In whole milk  14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins  Egg white and egg yolk contain specialized riboflavin binding proteins  which are required for storage of free riboflavin in the egg for use by the developing embryo   It is used in baby foods  breakfast cereals  pastas  sauces  processed cheese  fruit drinks  vitamin enriched milk products  and some energy drinks  It is difficult to incorporate riboflavin into many liquid products because it has poor solubility in water  hence the requirement for riboflavin 5  phosphate  E101a   a more soluble form of riboflavin  Riboflavin is also used as a food coloring and as such is designated in Europe as the E number E101   Riboflavin is generally stable during the heat processing and normal cooking of foods if light is excluded  The alkaline conditions in which riboflavin is unstable are rarely encountered in foodstuffs  Riboflavin degradation in milk can occur slowly in dark during storage in the refrigerator   2 2  Dietary reference intakes  The latest  1998  RDA recommendations for vitamin B2 are similar to the 1989 RDA  which for adults  suggested a minimum intake of 1 2 mg for persons whose caloric intake may be b 2 000 Kcal  The current RDAs for riboflavin for adult men and women are 1 3 mg day and 1 1 mg day  respectively  the estimated average requirement for adult men and women are 1 1 mg and 0 9 mg  respectively  Recommendations for daily riboflavin intake increase with pregnancy and lactation to 1 4 mg and 1 6 mg  respectively  1in advanced   For infants  the RDA is 0 3 0 4 mg day and for children it is 0 6 0 9 mg day   3  Deficiency  3 1  Signs and symptoms  Riboflavin deficiency is also called ariboflavinosis  It was originally known as pellagra sin pellagra  pellagra without pellagra   as it exhibits certain similarities to the niacin deficiency pellagra   In humans the classical syndrom affects the mouth  sore throat  inflammation of the lining of mouth and tongue   angular cheilitis   the eyes  photophobia with bloodshot  itchy  watery eyes   the skin  moist  scaly skin particularly affecting the scrotum or labia majora and the nasolabial folds  and the blood  decreased red blood cell count with normal cell size and hemoglobin content i e  normochromic normocytic anemia   In children it also results in reduced growth   About 28 million Americans exhibit a common ‘sub clinical’ deficiency  2003  characterized by metabolic lesions i e  a change in biochemical indices  e g  reduced plasma erythrocyte glutathione reductase levels    In animals  riboflavin deficiency results in lack of growth  failure to thrive  and eventual death  Experimental riboflavin deficiency in dogs results in growth failure  weakness  ataxia  and inability to stand  The animals collapse  become comatose  and die  During the deficiency state  dermatitis develops together with hair loss  Other signs include corneal opacity  lenticular cataracts  hemorrhagic adrenals  fatty degeneration of the kidney and liver  and inflammation of the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal tract  Post mortem studies in rhesus monkeys fed a riboflavin deficient diet revealed about one third the normal amount of riboflavin was present in the liver  which is the main storage organ for riboflavin in mammals   An animal model of riboflavin kinase deficiency has been identified  Since Riboflavin cannot be converted into the catalytically active cofactors without this enzyme a vitamin deficiency syndrome is generated in the model   3 2  Diagnosis  Overt clinical signs are rarely seen among inhabitants of the developed countries  The assessment of Riboflavin status is essential for confirming cases with unspecific symptoms where deficiency is suspected   Glutathione reductase is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate  NADPH  and FAD dependent enzyme  and the major flavoprotein in erythrocyte  The measurement of the activity coefficient of erythrocyte glutathione reductase  EGR  is the preferred method for assessing riboflavin status  It provides a measure of tissue saturation and long term riboflavin status  In vitro enzyme activity in terms of activity coefficients  AC  is determined both with and without the addition of FAD to the medium  ACs represent a ratio of the enzyme’s activity with FAD to the enzyme’s activity without FAD  An AC of 1 2 to 1 4  riboflavin status is considered low when FAD is added to stimulate enzyme activity  An AC   1 4 suggests riboflavin deficiency  On the other hand  if FAD is added and AC is   1 2  then riboflavin status is considered acceptable  Tillotson and Bashor reported that a decrease in the intakes of riboflavin was associated with increase in EGR AC  In the UK study of Norwich elderly  initial EGR AC values for both males and females were significantly correlated with those measured 2 years later  suggesting that EGR AC may be a reliable measure of long term biochemical riboflavin status of individuals  These findings are consistent with earlier studies   Experimental balance studies indicate that urinary riboflavin excretion rates increase slowly with increasing intakes  until intake level approach 1 0 mg d  when tissue saturation occurs  At higher intakes  the rate of excretion increases dramatically  Once intakes of 2 5 mg d are reached  excretion becomes approximately equal to the rate of absorption  Horwitt et al   1950   18   At such high intake a significant proportion of the riboflavin intake is not absorbed  If urinary riboflavin excretion is  19 µg g creatinine  without recent riboflavin intake  or   40 µg per day are indicative of deficiency   3 3  Causes  Riboflavin is continuously excreted in the urine of healthy individuals  making deficiency relatively common when dietary intake is insufficient  Riboflavin deficiency is usually found together with other nutrient deficiencies  particularly of other water soluble vitamins  A deficiency of riboflavin can be primary   poor vitamin sources in one s daily diet   or secondary  which may be a result of conditions that affect absorption in the intestine  the body not being able to use the vitamin  or an increase in the excretion of the vitamin from the body  Subclinical deficiency has also been observed in women taking oral contraceptives  in the elderly  in people with eating disorders  chronic alcoholism and in diseases such as HIV  inflammatory bowel disease  diabetes and chronic heart disease  Phototherapy to treat jaundice in infants can cause increased degradation of riboflavin  leading to deficiency if not monitored closely   3 4  Treatment  Treatment involves a diet which includes an adequate amount of riboflavin usually in form of commercially available supplements   4  Medical uses  Riboflavin has been used in several clinical and therapeutic situations  For over 30 years  riboflavin supplements have been used as part of the phototherapy treatment of neonatal jaundice  The light used to irradiate the infants breaks down not only bilirubin  the toxin causing the jaundice  but also the naturally occurring riboflavin within the infant s blood  so extra supplementation is necessary   One clinical trial found that high dose riboflavin appears to be useful alone or along with beta blockers in the prevention of migraine  A dose of 400 mg daily has been used effectively in the prophylaxis of migraines  especially in combination with a daily supplement of magnesium citrate 500 mg and  in some cases  a supplement of coenzyme Q10  However  two other clinical studies have failed to find any significant results for the effectiveness of B2 as a treatment for migraine   Riboflavin in combination with UV light has been shown to be effective in reducing the ability of harmful pathogens found in blood products to cause disease  When UV light is applied to blood products containing riboflavin  the nucleic acids in pathogens are damaged  rendering them unable to replicate and cause disease  Riboflavin and UV light treatment has been shown to be effective for inactivating pathogens in platelets and plasma  and is under development for application to whole blood  Because platelets and red blood cells do not contain a nucleus  i e  they have no DNA to be damaged  the technique is well suited for destroying nucleic acid containing pathogens  including viruses  bacteria  parasites  and white blood cells  in blood products   Recently  riboflavin has been used in a new treatment to slow or stop the progression of the corneal disorder keratoconus  This is called corneal collagen crosslinking  CXL   In corneal crosslinking  riboflavin drops are applied to the patient’s corneal surface  Once the riboflavin has penetrated through the cornea  ultraviolet A light therapy is applied  This induces collagen crosslinking  which increases the tensile strength of the cornea  The treatment has been shown in several studies to stabilize keratoconus   Treatment for Brown vialetto van laere  fazio londe  and the myopathic form of adult onset coenzyme q10 deficiency   5  Industrial uses  Because riboflavin is fluorescent under UV light  dilute solutions  0 015 0 025% w w  are often used to detect leaks or to demonstrate coverage in an industrial system such a chemical blend tank or bioreactor   See the ASME BPE section on Testing and Inspection for additional details    6  Toxicity  In humans  there is no evidence for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes  as its low solubility keeps it from being absorbed in dangerous amounts within the digestive tract  Even when 400 mg of riboflavin per day was given orally to subjects in one study for three months to investigate the efficacy of riboflavin in the prevention of migraine headache  no short term side effects were reported  Although toxic doses can be administered by injection  any excess at nutritionally relevant doses is excreted in the urine  imparting a bright yellow color when in large quantities   7  Industrial synthesis  Various biotechnological processes have been developed for industrial scale riboflavin biosynthesis using different microorganisms  including filamentous fungi such as Ashbya gossypii  Candida famata and Candida flaveri  as well as the bacteria Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Bacillus subtilis  The latter organism has been genetically modified to both increase the bacteria s production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic  ampicillin  resistance marker  and is now successfully employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification purposes  The chemical company BASF has installed a plant in South Korea  which is specialized on riboflavin production using Ashbya gossypii  The concentrations of riboflavin in their modified strain are so high  that the mycelium has a reddish brownish color and accumulates riboflavin crystals in the vacuoles  which will eventually burst the mycelium  Riboflavin is sometimes overproduced  possibly as a protective mechanism  by certain bacteria in the presence of high concentrations of hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds  One such organism is Micrococcus luteus  American Type Culture Collection strain number ATCC 49442   which develops a yellow color due to production of riboflavin while growing on pyridine  but not when grown on other substrates  such as succinic acid   8  History  Vitamin B was originally considered to have two components  a heat labile vitamin B1 and a heat stable vitamin B2  In the 1920s  vitamin B2 was thought to be the factor necessary for preventing pellagra  In 1923  Paul Gyorgy in Heidelberg was investigating egg white injury in rats  the curative factor for this condition was called vitamin H  which is now called biotin or vitamin B7   Since both pellagra and vitamin H deficiency were associated with dermatitis  Gyorgy decided to test the effect of vitamin B2 on vitamin H deficiency in rats  He enlisted the service of Wagner Jauregg in Kuhn’s laboratory  In 1933  Kuhn  Gyorgy  and Wagner found that thiamin free extracts of yeast  liver  or rice bran prevented the growth failure of rats fed a thiamin supplemented diet   Further  the researchers noted that a yellow green fluorescence in each extract promoted rat growth  and that the intensity of fluorescence was proportional to the effect on growth  This observation enabled them to develop a rapid chemical and bioassay to isolate the factor from egg white in 1933  they called it Ovoflavin  The same group then isolated the same preparation  a growth promoting compound with yellow green fluorescence  from whey using the same procedure  lactoflavin   In 1934 Kuhn’s group identified the structure of so called flavin and synthesized vitamin B2   9
