Voice analysis is the study of speech sounds for purposes other than linguistic content  such as in speech recognition  Such studies include mostly medical analysis of the voice i e  phoniatrics  but also speaker identification  More controversially  some believe that the truthfulness or emotional state of speakers can be determined using Voice Stress Analysis or Layered Voice Analysis   1  Typical voice problems  A medical study of the voice can be  for instance  analysis of the voice of patients who have had a polyp removed from their vocal cords through an operation  In order to objectively evaluate the improvement in voice quality there has to be some measure of voice quality  An experienced voice therapist can quite reliably evaluate the voice  but this requires extensive training and is still always subjective   Another active research topic in medical voice analysis is vocal loading evaluation  The vocal cords of a person speaking for an extended period of time will suffer from tiring  that is  the process of speaking exerts a load on the vocal cords where the tissue will suffer from tiring  Among professional voice users  i e  teachers  sales people  this tiring can cause voice failures and sick leaves  To evaluate these problems vocal loading needs to be objectively measured   2  Analysis methods  Voice problems that require voice analysis most commonly originate from the vocal folds or the laryngeal musculature that controls them  since the folds are subject to collision forces with each vibratory cycle and to drying from the air being forced through the small gap between them  and the laryngeal musclature is intensely active during speech or singing and is subject to tiring  However  dynamic analysis of the vocal folds and their movement is physically difficult  The location of the vocal folds effectively prohibits direct  invasive measurement of movement  Less invasive imaging methods such as x rays or ultrasounds do not work because the vocal cords are surrounded by cartilage which distort image quality  Movements in the vocal cords are rapid  fundamental frequencies are usually between 80 and 300 Hz  thus preventing usage of ordinary video  Stroboscopic  and provide an option but in order to see the vocal folds  a fiberoptic probe leading to the camera has to be positioned in the throat  which makes speaking difficult  In addition  placing objects in the pharynx usually triggers a gag reflex that stops voicing and closes the larynx  In addition  stroboscopic imaging is only useful when the vocal fold vibratory pattern is closely periodic   The most important indirect methods are currently inverse filtering of either microphone or oral airflow recordings and electroglottography  EGG   In inverse filtering  the speech sound  the radiated acoustic pressure waveform  as obtained from a microphone  or the oral airflow waveform from a mask is recorded outside the mouth and then filtered by a mathematical method to remove the effects of the vocal tract  This method produces an estimate of the waveform of the glottal airflow pulses  which in turn reflect the movements of the vocal folds  The other kind of noninvasive indirect indication of vocal fold motion is the electroglottography  in which electrodes placed on either side of the subject s throat at the level of the vocal folds record the changes in the conductivity of the throat according to how large a portion of the vocal folds are touching each other  It thus yields one dimensional information of the contact area  Neither inverse filtering nor EGG are sufficient to completely describe the complex 3 dimensional pattern of vocal fold movement  but can provide useful indirect evidence of that movement   3  External links  4  See also  Voice biometrics  Speech processing  Audio signal processing  Digital signal processing  Stuttering
