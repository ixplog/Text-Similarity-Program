Kaddish  קדיש  Qaddish Aramaic   holy   alternative spellings  qaddish  ḳaddish  is a hymn of praises to God found in the Jewish prayer service  The central theme of the Kaddish is the magnification and sanctification of God s name  In the liturgy different versions of the Kaddish are used functionally as separators between sections of the service   The term  Kaddish  is often used to refer specifically to  The Mourner s Kaddish   said as part of the mourning rituals in Judaism in all prayer services  as well as at funerals  other than at the grave site – see below Kaddish ahar Hakk vurah  and memorials  When mention is made of  saying Kaddish   this unambiguously refers to the rituals of mourning  Mourners say Kaddish to show that despite the loss they still praise God   The opening words of this prayer are inspired by   a vision of God becoming great in the eyes of all the nations  The central line of the Kaddish in Jewish tradition is the congregation s response  יְהֵא שְׁמֵהּ רַבָּא מְבָרַךְ לְעָלַם וּלְעָלְמֵי עָלְמַיָּא  Yehei shmëh rabba mevarakh lealam ulalmey almaya   May His great name be blessed for ever  and to all eternity    a public declaration of God s greatness and eternality  This response is an Aramaic translation of the Hebrew  ברוך שם כבוד מלכותו לעולם ועד   Blessed be His name  whose glorious kingdom is forever   which is to be found in the Jerusalem Targum  יְהֵא שְׁמֵיהּ רַבָּא מְבָרֵךְ לְעָלְמֵי עַלְמִין   Genesis 49 2 and Deuteronomy 6 4   and is similar to the wording of    The Mourner s  Rabbi s and Complete Kaddish end with a supplication for peace   Oseh Shalom       which is in Hebrew  and is somewhat similar to the Bible    Along with the Shema and Amidah  the Kaddish is one of the most important and central elements in the Jewish liturgy   1  History and background   The Kaddish is in origin a closing doxology to an Aggadic discourse   Most of it is written in Aramaic  which  at the time of its original composition  was the lingua franca of the Jewish people  It is not composed in the vernacular Aramaic  however  but rather in a  literary  jargon Aramaic  that was used in the academies  and is identical to the dialect of the Targum   The oldest version of the Kaddish is found in the Siddur of Rab Amram Gaon  c  900  Shira Schoenberg observes that  The first mention of mourners saying Kaddish at the end of the service is in a 13th century halakhic writing by Isaac ben Moses of Vienna  the Or Zarua  literally  Light is Sown    The Kaddish at the end of the service became designated as Kaddish Yatom or Mourner s Kaddish  literally   Orphan s Kaddish     2  Variant forms  The various versions of the Kaddish are   Hatzi Kaddish  חצי קדיש  or Kaddish Le ela  קדיש לעלא Literally  Half Kaddish   sometimes called the  Reader s Kaddish   Kaddish Yatom  קדיש יתום  or Kaddish Yehe Shelama Rabba  קדיש יהא שלמא רבא Literally  Orphan s Kaddish   although commonly referred to as Kaddish Avelim  קדיש אבלים   the  Mourner s Kaddish   Kaddish Shalem  קדיש שלם  or Kaddish Titkabbal  קדיש תתקבל Literally  Complete Kaddish  or  Whole Kaddish   Kaddish d Rabbanan  קדיש דרבנן  or Kaddish al Yisrael  קדיש על ישראל Literally  Kaddish of the Rabbis   Kaddish ahar Hakk vura  קדיש אחר הקבורה Literally  Kaddish after a Burial   also called Kaddish d Ithadata  קדיש דאתחדתא  named after one of the first distinguishing words in this variant   Kaddish ahar Hashlamas Masechta  קדיש אחר השלמת מסכת Literally  Kaddish after the completion of a tractate   i e  at a siyum  for Sefardim same as Kaddish d Rabbanan    also called Kaddish haGadol  קדיש הגדול  literally  the Great Kaddish as it is the longest Kaddish  All versions of the Kaddish begin with the Hatzi Kaddish  there are some extra passages in the Kaddish after a burial or a siyum   The longer versions contain additional paragraphs  and are often named after distinctive words in those paragraphs   The Half Kaddish is used to punctuate divisions within the service  for example  before Barechu  between the Shema and the Amidah and following readings from the Torah  The Kaddish d Rabbanan is used after any part of the service that includes extracts from the Mishnah or the Talmud  as its original purpose was to close a study session  Kaddish Titkabbal originally marked the end of the service  though in later times extra passages and hymns were added to follow it   The Jewish Encyclopedia s article on Kaddish mentions an additional type of Kaddish  called  Kaddish Yahid   or  Individual s Kaddish   This is included in the Siddur of Amram Gaon  but is a meditation taking the place of Kaddish rather than a Kaddish in the normal sense   3  Text of the Kaddish  The following includes the half  complete  mourner s and rabbi s kaddish  The variant lines of the kaddish after a burial or a siyum are given below   3 1  Text of the Burial Kaddish  In the burial kaddish  and that after a siyum according to Ashkenazim i  lines 2 3 are replaced by   3 2  Notes  Bracketed text varies according to personal or communal traditions    a  The congregation responds with  amen   אָמֵן  after lines 1  4  7  12  15  18  27  33  36  In the Ashkenazi tradition  the response to line 12 is  Blessed be he   בְּרִיךְ הוּא b rikh hu     b  On line 1  some say Yitgaddeyl veyitqaddeysh rather than Yitgaddal veyitqaddash  because the roots of these two words are Hebrew and not Aramaic  the Aramaic equivalent would be Yitrabay veyitkadash   some authorities  but not others  felt that both words should be rendered in pure Hebrew pronunciation    c  Line 13  in the Ashkenazi tradition the repeated  le ela  is used only during the Ten Days of Repentance  In the Sephardi tradition it is never used  In the Yemenite tradition it is the invariable wording  The phrase  le ela le ela  is the Targum s translation of the Hebrew  ma la ma la   Deuteronomy 28 43     d  Lines 4 and 30–32 are not present in the Ashkenazi tradition   Revaḥ vehatzala  is said aloud by the congregation    e  Line 26  some Sephardi Jews say malka  or maram or mareh  di shmaya ve ar a  the King  or Master  of Heaven and Earth  instead of avuhon de vi shmaya  their Father in Heaven   De Sola Pool uses mara  the London Spanish and Portuguese Jews use the same text as the Ashkenazim    f  During the  complete kaddish  some include the following congregational responses  which are not regarded as part of the text   Before line 16   accept our prayer with mercy and favour   Before line 28   May the name of God be blessed  from now and forever      Before line 34   My help is from God  creator of heaven and earth       g  Line 35   b rahamav  is used by Sephardim in all versions of kaddish  by Ashkenazim only in  Kaddish deRabbanan     h  Line 36   ammo  is used by most Sephardim  but not by some of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews or Ashkenazim    i  Lines 37 to 45  these lines are also recited by Yemenite Jews as part of every Kaddish DeRabbanan    z  In line 22  the bracketed word is added in the Land of Israel   In line 1  as noted in  a   the congregation responds  Amen   even though this commonly is not printed in most prayerbooks  This longstanding and widespread tradition actually introduces a break in the verse which may lead to misinterpretation as the phrase  according to His will  would then appear to apply only to  which he created  instead of to  Magnified and sanctified    It is common that the entire congregation recites lines 8 and 9 with the leader  and it is also common that the congregation will include in its collective recitation the first word of the next line  line 10   Yitbarakh  This is commonly thought to be done to prevent any interruption before the next line  which begins with Yitbarakh  is recited by the leader  But this inclusion of Yitbarakh has not always been the case  Maimonides and the Tur did not include it in the congregation s recitation  Amram Gaon  the Vilna Gaon  and the Shulchan Aruch include it  Full Hebrew  translation and transliteration can also be found at the Orthodox Union   4  Customs  The Kaddish  as used in the services on special days is chanted  There are different melodies in different Jewish traditions and within each tradition the melody can change according to the version  the day it is said and even the position in the service  many mourners recite it slowly and contemplatively   In Sephardi synagogues the whole congregation sits for Kaddish  except   during the Kaddish immediately before the Amidah  where everyone stands   during the Mourner s Kaddish  where those reciting it stand and everyone else sits  In Ashkenazi synagogues  the custom varies  Very commonly  in both Orthodox and Reform congregations  everyone stands  but in some  especially many Conservative and Hasidic  synagogues  most of the congregants sit  Sometimes  a distinction is made between the different forms of Kaddish  or each congregant stands or sits according to his or her own custom  The Mourner s Kaddish is often treated differently from the other variations of Kaddish in the service  as is the Half Kaddish before the maftir   Those standing to recite the Kaddish bow  by widespread tradition  at various places  Generally  At the first word of the prayer  at each Amen  at Yitbarakh  at Brikh hu  and for the last verse  Oseh shalom   For Oseh shalom it is customary take three steps back  if possible  then bow to one s left  then to one s right  and finally bow forward  as if taking leave of the presence of a king  in the same way as when the same words are used as the concluding line of the Amidah   5  Mourner s Kaddish   Mourner s Kaddish  is said at all prayer services and certain other occasions  It is written in Aramaic  It takes the form of Kaddish Yehe Shelama Rabba  and is traditionally recited several times  most prominently at or towards the end of the service  after the Aleinu and or closing Psalms and or  on the Sabbath  Ani im Zemirot  Following the death of a parent  child  spouse  or sibling it is customary to recite the Mourner s Kaddish in the presence of a congregation daily for thirty days  or eleven months in the case of a parent  and then at every anniversary of the death  The  mourner  who says the Kaddish will be any person present at a service who has the obligation to recite Kaddish in accordance with these rules   Customs for reciting the Mourner s Kaddish vary markedly among various communities  In Sephardi synagogues  the custom is that all the mourners stand and chant the Kaddish together  In Ashkenazi synagogues  the earlier custom was that one mourner be chosen to lead the prayer on behalf of the rest  though most congregations have now adopted the Sephardi custom  In many Reform synagogues  the entire congregation recites the Mourner s Kaddish together  This is sometimes said to be for those victims of the Holocaust who have no one left to recite the Mourner s Kaddish on their behalf  In some congregations  especially Reform and Conservative ones   the Rabbi will read a list of the deceased who have a Yahrzeit on that day  or who have died within the past month   and then ask the congregants to name any people they are mourning for  Some synagogues try to multiply the number of times that the Mourner s Kaddish is recited  for example  reciting a separate Mourner s Kaddish after both Aleinu and then each closing Psalm  Other synagogues limit themselves to one Mourner s Kaddish at the end of the service   Saying the Mourner s Kaddish was mostly prohibited for Orthodox Jewish women  but is now becoming more common  In 2013 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a halachic ruling which allows women  for the first time  to say the Kaddish in memory of their deceased parents  Ephraim Mirvis  an Orthodox rabbi who serves as the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth  supports Orthodox women saying Kaddish   It is important to note that the Mourner s Kaddish does not mention death at all  but instead praises God  Though the Kaddish is often popularly referred to as the  Jewish Prayer for the Dead   that designation more accurately belongs to the prayer called  El male rachamim   which specifically prays for the soul of the deceased   6  Use of the Kaddish in the arts
