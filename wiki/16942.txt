The MV Wilhelm Gustloff was a German passenger ship which was sunk on 30 January 1945 by a Soviet submarine in the Baltic Sea while evacuating German civilians  officials and military personnel from Gdynia  Gotenhafen  as the Red Army advanced  By one estimate  9 400 people died which would make it the largest loss of life in a single ship sinking in history   Constructed as a cruise ship for the Nazi Kraft durch Freude  Strength Through Joy  organisation in 1937  she had been requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine  German navy  in 1939  She served as a hospital ship in 1939 and 1940  She was then assigned as a floating barracks for naval personnel in Gdynia before being put into service to transport evacuees in 1945   1  Construction  The Wilhelm Gustloff was constructed by the Blohm & Voss shipyards  Measuring long by wide with a capacity of 25 484 gross register tons  she was launched on 5 May 1937   The ship was originally intended to be named Adolf Hitler but was named after Wilhelm Gustloff  a leader of the National Socialist Party s Swiss branch  who had been assassinated in 1936  Hitler decided on the name change after sitting next to Gustloff’s widow during his memorial service   2  Cruise liner  The Wilhelm Gustloff was the first purpose built cruise liner for the German Labour Front  Deutsche Arbeitsfront  DAF  and used by subsidiary organisation Kraft durch Freude  KdF   Strength Through Joy   Its purposes were to provide recreational and cultural activities for German functionaries and workers  including concerts  cruises  and other holiday trips  and as a public relations tool  to present  a more acceptable image of the Third Reich   She was the flagship of the KdF cruise fleet  her last civilian role  until the spring of 1939   3  Military career  During the summer of 1939  she was pressed into service to bring the Condor Legion back from Spain after the victory of the Nationalist forces under General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War  From September 1939 to November 1940  she served as a hospital ship  with her official designation being Lazarettschiff D   Beginning on 20 November 1940  the medical equipment was removed from the ship and it was repainted from the hospital ship colors of white with a green stripe to standard naval grey  As a consequence of the British blockade of the German coastline  she was used as an accommodations ship  barracks  for approximately 1 000 U boat trainees of the 2nd Submarine Training Division  2  Unterseeboot Lehrdivision  in the port of Gdynia  which had been occupied by Germany and renamed Gotenhafen  located near Danzig  In 1942  the SS Cap Arcona was used as a stand in for the Titanic in the German film version of the disaster  Filmed in Gotenhafen  the 2nd Submarine Training Division acted as extras in the movie  The Wilhelm Gustloff sat dockside for over four years  until she was put back in service to transport civilians and military personnel as part of Operation Hannibal   4  Operation Hannibal – Evacuation  Operation Hannibal was the naval evacuation of German troops and civilians from Courland  East Prussia and the Polish Corridor as the Red Army advanced  Wilhelm Gustloff s final voyage was to evacuate German refugees and military personnel as well as technicians who worked at advanced weapon bases in the Baltic from Gdynia  then known to the Germans as Gotenhafen  to Kiel   The ship s complement and passenger lists cited 6 050 people on board  but this did not include many civilians who boarded the ship without being recorded in the ship s official embarkation records  Heinz Schön  a German archivist and Gustloff survivor who carried out extensive research into the sinking during the 1980s and 1990s  concluded that the Wilhelm Gustloff was carrying a crew of 173  naval armed forces auxiliaries   918 officers  NCOs  and men of the 2 Unterseeboot Lehrdivision  373 female naval auxiliary helpers  162 wounded soldiers  and 8 956 civilians of which an estimated 5 000 were children  for a total of 10 582 passengers and crew  Besides soldiers  the passengers included Nazis dignitaries  as well as members of Gestapo and Todt organization   The ship left Gotenhafen early on 30 January 1945  accompanied by the passenger liner Hansa  also filled with civilians and military personnel  and two torpedo boats  The Hansa and one torpedo boat developed mechanical problems and could not continue  leaving the Wilhelm Gustloff with one torpedo boat escort  the Löwe  The ship had four captains  the Gustloff s captain  two merchant marine captains and the captain of the U Boat complement housed on the vessel  on board  and they could not agree on the best course of action to guard against submarine attacks  Against the advice of the military commander  Lieutenant Commander Wilhelm Zahn  a submariner who argued for a course in shallow waters close to shore and without lights   the Gustloff s captain—Friedrich Petersen—decided to head for deep water which was known to have been cleared of mines  When he was informed by a mysterious radio message of an oncoming German minesweeper convoy  he decided to activate his ship s red and green navigation lights so as to avoid a collision in the dark  making the Wilhelm Gustloff easy to spot in the night  The source or authenticity of this radio message was never confirmed and there was no oncoming German minesweeper convoy as it later turned out   As the Wilhelm Gustloff had been fitted with anti aircraft guns  and the Germans in obedience to the rules of war did not mark it as a hospital ship  no notification of it operating in a hospital capacity had been given and  as it was transporting military personnel  it did not have any protection as a hospital ship under international accords   4 1  Sinking  The ship and its escorting torpedo boat were soon sighted by the Soviet submarine   under the command of Captain Alexander Marinesko  The U boat sensing equipment on board the escorting torpedo boat had frozen rendering it inoperable as had the Gustloff s anti aircraft guns  leaving the vessels defenceless  Marinesko followed the ships for two hours before launching three torpedoes at the Wilhelm Gustloff′s port side about offshore between Großendorf and Leba soon after 21 00  CET   hitting it with all three   Marinesko intended to fire four torpedoes but the fourth misfired and the crew had to disarm it   The first torpedo  with a text written on it   For the Motherland   struck near the port bow  The second torpedo   For the Soviet people   hit just ahead of midships  The third torpedo   For Leningrad   struck the engine room in the area below the ship s funnel  cutting off electrical power to the ship  The Gustloff took a light list to port and settled rapidly by the head  The fourth torpedo  disarmed  was named  For Stalin    The first torpedo caused the watertight doors to seal off the bow which contained the crews  quarters where off duty crew members were sleeping  The second torpedo hit the accommodations for the Women’s Naval Auxiliary  located in the ship s drained swimming pool   only three of the 373 quartered there survived  The third torpedo was a direct hit on the engine room  cutting all power and communications  Reportedly  only one lifeboat was able to be lowered  the rest had frozen in their davits and had to be broken free with some lost when they fell or capsized as a result of the panic  The water temperature in the Baltic Sea at this time of year is usually around   however  this was a particularly cold night  with an air temperature of and ice floes covering the surface  Many deaths were caused either directly by the torpedoes or by drowning in the onrushing water  Others were crushed in the initial panic on the stairs and decks  and many jumped into the icy Baltic  The majority of those who perished succumbed to exposure in the freezing water   Less than 40 minutes after being struck  the Wilhelm Gustloff was lying on her side and sank bow first  in of water  Thousands of people were trapped inside on the promenade deck   German forces were able to rescue some  a total of 1 252  of the survivors from the attack  torpedo boat T 36 rescued 564 people  torpedo boat Löwe  472  Minesweeper M387  98  Minesweeper M375  43  Minesweeper M341  37  the steamer Göttingen saved 28  torpedo recovery boat  Torpedofangboot  TF19  seven  the freighter Gotland  two  and Patrol boat  Vorpostenboot  V1703 was able to save one baby   All four captains on the Gustloff survived its sinking  but an official naval inquiry was started only against Wilhelm Zahn  His degree of responsibility was never resolved  however  because of Nazi Germany s collapse in 1945   4 2  Losses  The figures from the research of Heinz Schön make the total lost in the sinking to be about 9 343 total  including about 5 000 children  This would represent the largest loss of life resulting from the sinking of a single vessel in maritime history   Heinz Schön s more recent research is backed up by estimates made by a different method  An episode of Unsolved History that aired in March 2003 on the Discovery Channel program undertook a computer analysis of its sinking  Using software called maritime EXODUS it was estimated 9 400 souls were lost of over 10 600 on board  This analysis considered the passenger density based on witness reports and a simulation of escape routes and survivability with the timeline of the sinking   5  Aftermath  Many ships carrying civilians were sunk during the war by both the Allies and Axis  However  based on the latest estimates of passenger numbers and those known to be saved  the Wilhelm Gustloff remains the largest loss of life resulting from the sinking of one vessel in maritime history  Günter Grass  in an interview published by the New York Times in April 2003   One of the many reasons I wrote Crabwalk was to take the subject away from the extreme Right   They said the tragedy of the Gustloff was a war crime  It wasn t  It was terrible  but it was a result of war  a terrible result of war    About 1 000 German naval officers and men were aboard during  and died in  the sinking of the Gustloff  The women on board the ship at the time of the sinking were inaccurately described by Soviet propaganda as  SS personnel from the German concentration camps   There were  however  a number of female naval auxiliaries amongst the passengers  Besides civilians the ship passengers included Gestapo personnel  members of the Todt organization and Nazi officials with their families   Just 11 days after the sinking  the S 13 would sink another German ship  the SS General von Steuben  on 10 February  in which around 3 000 people lost their lives  Following the sinking of the Steuben  Hitler had Alexander Marinesko declared a  personal enemy    Before sinking the Gustloff  Alexander Marinesko was facing a court martial due to his problems with alcohol and was thus deemed  not suitable to be a hero  for his actions and was instead awarded the Order of the Red Banner  Although widely recognized as a brilliant commander  he was downgraded in rank to lieutenant and dishonorably discharged from the Navy in October 1945  In 1960 he was reinstated as Captain Third Class and granted a full pension  In 1963 Marinesko was given the traditional ceremony due to a captain upon his successful return from a mission  He died three weeks later from cancer  Marinesko was posthumously awarded Hero of the Soviet Union by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990   6  Wreckage  Noted as  Obstacle No  73  on Polish navigation charts  and classified as a war grave  Gustloff rests at   about offshore  east of Łeba  17 33E  and west of Władysławowo  18 24E   It is one of the largest shipwrecks on the Baltic Sea floor and has been attracting much interest from treasure hunters searching for the lost Amber Room  In order to protect the property on board the war grave wreck of the MV Wilhelm Gustloff and to protect the environment  the Polish Maritime Office in Gdynia has forbidden diving within a radius of the wreck   In 2006  a bell recovered from the wreck and subsequently used as decoration in a Polish fish restaurant was lent to a privately funded  Forced Paths  exhibition in Berlin   7  Books  documentaries and movies  7 1  Books in German  The most
