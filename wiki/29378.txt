Scrooge McDuck is a cartoon character created in 1947 by Carl Barks and licensed by The Walt Disney Company  Scrooge is an elderly Scottish anthropomorphic Pekin Duck with a yellow orange bill  legs  and feet  He typically wears a red or blue frock coat  top hat  pince nez glasses  and spats and is portrayed in animations as speaking with a slight Scottish accent  also sometimes known as a Scottish burr  His dominant character trait is his thrift  and within the context of the fictional Disney universe  he is the world s richest person   Named after Ebenezer Scrooge from the 1843 novel A Christmas Carol  Scrooge is a wealthy Scottish business magnate and tycoon  He was in his first few appearances characterized as a greedy miser and antihero  as Charles Dickens  original Scrooge was   but in later comics and animated shorts and the modern day he is more often portrayed as a charitable and thrifty hero  adventurer  explorer and philanthropist  Scrooge was created by Barks as a comic book character originally as an antagonist for Donald Duck  first appearing in the 1947 Four Color story  Christmas on Bear Mountain   #178   The character soon became so popular that McDuck became a major figure of the Duck universe  In 1952 he was given his own comic book series  called Uncle Scrooge  which still runs today  Scrooge was most famously drawn by his creator Carl Barks  and later by Don Rosa  Comics have remained Scrooge s primary medium  although he has also appeared in animated cartoons  most extensively in the television series DuckTales  1987–1990    Along with several other characters in the Disney franchise  Scrooge has enjoyed international popularity  particularly in Europe  and books about him are frequently translated into other languages  He is the maternal uncle of Donald Duck  the grand uncle of Huey  Dewey and Louie  and a usual financial backer of Gyro Gearloose  His  money bin  and indeed Scrooge himself are often used as humorous metonyms for great wealth in popular culture around the world   One possible inspiration is an unnamed character in the 1943 Donald Duck short film The Spirit of  43 who was a representation of Donald s thrifty conscience  This anonymous character had many of Scrooge s characteristics including sideburns  pince nez glasses  and a Scottish accent   1  Comics history  1 1  First appearance  Scrooge McDuck  maternal uncle of previously established character Donald Duck  made his first named appearance in the story Christmas on Bear Mountain which was published in Dell s Four Color Comics #178  December 1947  written and drawn by artist Carl Barks  His appearance may have been based on a similar looking  nameless Scottish character from the 1943 propaganda short The Spirit of  43   In Christmas on Bear Mountain  Scrooge was a bearded  bespectacled  reasonably wealthy old duck  visibly leaning on his cane  and living in isolation in a  huge mansion   Scrooge s misanthropic thoughts in this first story are quite pronounced   Here I sit in this big lonely dump  waiting for Christmas to pass  Bah  That silly season when everybody loves everybody else  A curse on it  Me—I m different  Everybody hates me  and I hate everybody    Barks later reflected   Scrooge in  Christmas on Bear Mountain  was only my first idea of a rich  old uncle  I had made him too old and too weak  I discovered later on that I had to make him more active  I could not make an old guy like that do the things I wanted him to do    1 2  Recurring character  Barks would later claim that he originally only intended to use Scrooge as a one shot character  but then decided Scrooge  and his fortune  could prove useful for motivating further stories  Barks continued to experiment with Scrooge s appearance and personality over the next four years   Scrooge s second appearance  in The Old Castle s Secret  first published in June 1948   had Scrooge recruiting his nephews to search for a family treasure hidden in Dismal Downs  the McDuck family s ancestral castle  built in the middle of Rannoch Moor in Scotland  Foxy Relations  first published in November  1948  was the first story where Scrooge is called by his title and catchphrase  The Richest Duck in the World    1 3  First hints of Scrooge s past  The story  Voodoo Hoodoo  first published in Dell s Four Color Comics #238  August 1949  was the first story to hint at Scrooge s past with the introduction of two figures from it  The first was Foola Zoola  an old African sorcerer and chief of the Voodoo tribe who had cursed Scrooge  seeking revenge for the destruction of his village and the taking of his tribe s lands by Scrooge decades ago   Scrooge privately admitted to his nephews that he had used an army of  cutthroats  to get the tribe to abandon their lands  in order to establish a rubber plantation  The event was placed by Carl Barks in 1879 during the story  but it would later be retconned by Don Rosa to 1909 to fit with Scrooge s later established personal history   The second figure was Bombie the Zombie  the organ of the sorcerer s curse and revenge  He had reportedly sought Scrooge for decades before reaching Duckburg  mistaking Donald for Scrooge   Barks  with a note of skepticism often found in his stories  explained the zombie as a living person who has never died  but has somehow gotten under the influence of a sorcerer  Although some scenes of the story were intended as a parody of Bela Lugosi s White Zombie  the story is the first to not only focus on Scrooge s past but also touch on the darkest aspects of his personality   1 4  Later stories  Trail of the Unicorn  first published in February 1950  introduced Scrooge s private zoo  One of his pilots had managed to photograph the last living unicorn  which lived in the Indian part of the Himalayas  Scrooge offered a reward to competing cousins Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander  which would go to the one who captured the unicorn for Scrooge s collection of animals   This was also the story that introduced Scrooge s private airplane  Barks would later establish Scrooge as an experienced aviator  Donald had previously been shown as a skilled aviator  as was Flintheart Glomgold in later stories  In comparison  Huey  Dewey  and Louie were depicted as only having taken flying lessons in the story Frozen Gold  published in January 1945    The Pixilated Parrot  first published in July 1950  introduced the precursor to Scrooge s money bin  in this story  Scrooge s central office building is said to contain  three cubic acres of money   Two nameless burglars who briefly appear during the story are considered to be the precursors of the Beagle Boys   1 5  Scrooge as a major character  The Magic Hourglass  first published in September 1950  was arguably the first story to change the focus of the Duck stories from Donald to Scrooge  During the story  several themes were introduced for Scrooge   Donald first mentions in this story that his uncle practically owns Duckburg  a statement that Scrooge s rival John D  Rockerduck would later put in dispute  Scrooge first hints that he was not born into wealth  as he remembers buying the Hourglass in Morocco when he was a member of a ship s crew as a cabin boy  It is also the first story in which Scrooge mentions speaking another language besides his native English and reading other alphabets besides the Latin alphabet  as during the story  he speaks Arabic and reads the Arabic alphabet   The latter theme would be developed further in later stories  Barks and current Scrooge writer Don Rosa have depicted Scrooge as being fluent in Arabic  Dutch  German  Mongolian  Spanish  Mayan  Bengali  Finnish  and various dialects of Chinese  Scrooge acquired this knowledge from years of living or traveling to the various regions of the world where those languages are spoken  Later writers would depict Scrooge having at least working knowledge of several other languages   Scrooge was shown in The Magic Hourglass in a more positive light than in previous stories  but his more villainous side is present too  Scrooge is seen in this story attempting to reacquire a magic hourglass that he gave to Donald  before finding out that it acted as a protective charm for him  Scrooge starts losing one billion dollars each minute  and comments that he will go bankrupt within 600 years  This line is a parody of Orson Welles s line in Citizen Kane “You know  Mr  Thatcher  at the rate of a million dollars a year  I ll have to close this place in    60 years”  To convince his nephews to return it  he pursues them throughout Morocco  where they had headed to earlier in the story  Memorably during the story  Scrooge interrogates Donald by having him tied up and tickled with a feather in an attempt to get Donald to reveal the hourglass s location  Scrooge finally manages to retrieve it  exchanging it for a flask of water  as he had found his nephews exhausted and left in the desert with no supplies  As Scrooge explains  he intended to give them a higher offer  but he just could not resist having somebody at his mercy without taking advantage of it   1 6  Final developments  A Financial Fable  first published in March 1951  had Scrooge teaching Donald some lessons in productivity as the source of wealth  along with the laws of supply and demand  Perhaps more importantly  it was also the first story where Scrooge observes how diligent and industrious Huey  Louie and Dewey are  making them more similar to himself rather than to Donald  Donald in Barks s stories is depicted as working hard on occasion  but given the choice often proves to be a shirker  The three younger nephews first side with Scrooge rather than Donald in this story  with the bond between granduncle and grandnephews strengthening in later stories  However  there have been rare instances where Donald proved invaluable to Scrooge  such as when the group traveled back in time to Ancient Egypt to retrieve a pharaoh s papyrus  Donald cautions against taking it with him  as no one would believe the story unless it was unearthed  Donald then buries it and makes a marking point from the Nile River  making Scrooge think to himself admiringly  Donald must have swallowed the     Terror of the Beagle Boys  first published in November 1951  introduced the readers to the Beagle Boys  although Scrooge in this story seems to be already familiar with them  The Big Bin on Killmotor Hill introduced Scrooge s money bin  built on Killmotor Hill in the center of Duckburg   By this point  Scrooge had become familiar to readers in the United States and Europe  Other Disney writers and artists besides Barks began using Scrooge in their own stories  including Italian writer Romano Scarpa  Western Publishing  the then publisher of the Disney crafty comics  started thinking about using Scrooge as a protagonist rather than a supporting character  and then decided to launch Scrooge in his own self titled comic  Uncle Scrooge #1  featuring the story Only a Poor Old Man  was published in March 1952 – 1953  This story along with Back to the Klondike  first published a year later in March 1953  became the biggest influences in how Scrooge s character  past  and beliefs would become defined   After this point  Barks produced most of his longer stories in Uncle Scrooge  with a focus mainly on adventure  while his ten page stories for Walt Disney s Comics and Stories continued to feature Donald as the star and focused on comedy  In Scrooge s stories  Donald and his nephews were cast as Scrooge s assistants  who accompanied Scrooge in his adventures around the world  This change of focus from Donald to Scrooge was also reflected in stories by other contemporary writers  Since then  Scrooge remains a central figure of the Duck comics  universe  thus the coining of the term  Scrooge McDuck Universe    1 7  The modern era  After Barks s retirement  the character continued under other artists  In 1972  Barks was persuaded to write more stories for Disney  He wrote Junior Woodchuck stories where Scrooge often plays the part of the villain  closer to the role he had before he acquired his own series  Under Barks  Scrooge always was a malleable character who would take on whatever persona was convenient to the plot   The Italian writer and artist Romano Scarpa made several additions to Scrooge McDuck s universe  including characters such as Brigitta McBridge  Scrooge s self styled fiancée  and Gideon McDuck  a newspaper editor who is Scrooge s brother  Those characters have appeared mostly in European comics  So is also the case for Scrooge s rival John D  Rockerduck  created by Barks for just one story  and Donald s cousin Fethry Duck  who sometimes works as a reporter for Scrooge s newspaper   Another major development was the arrival of writer and artist Don Rosa in 1986 with his story The Son of the Sun  released by Gladstone Publishing and nominated for a Harvey Award  one of the comics industry s highest honors  Rosa has said in interviews that he considers Scrooge to be his favorite Disney character  Unlike most other Disney writers  Don Rosa considered Scrooge as a historical character whose Disney adventures had occurred in the fifties and sixties and ended  in his undepicted death  in 1967 when Barks retired  He considered only Barks  stories canonical  and fleshed out a timeline as well as a family tree based on Barks  stories  Eventually he made The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck  a full history in twelve chapters which received an Eisner Award in 1995  Later on he included additional chapters  Under Rosa  Scrooge became more ethical  he never cheats  He owes his fortune to his hard work and his money bin is  full of souvenirs  since every coin reminds him of a specific circumstance  Although his work is scarce  Rosa remains the foremost contemporary duck artist and was nominated for five 2007 Eisner Awards  His work is regularly reprinted by itself as well as along with Barks stories for which he created a sequel   Daan Jippes  who can mimic Barks s art to a close extent  repenciled all of Barks s 1970s Junior Woodchucks stories  as well as Barks  final Uncle Scrooge stories  from the 1990s to the early 2000s  Other notable Disney artists who have worked with the Scrooge character include Marco Rota  William Van Horn  and Tony Strobl   In an interview with the Norwegian  Aftenposten  from 1992 Don Rosa says that  in the beginning Scrooge  owed  his existence to his nephew Donald  but that has changed and today it s Donald that  owes  his existence to Scrooge  and he also says that this is one of the reasons why he is so interested in Scrooge   2  Characterization  2 1  Wealth  Scrooge had worked his way up the financial ladder from humble immigrant roots  Firstly  he took up a job polishing and shining boots  and was enraged when a ditchdigger paid him with an 1875 US dime  which was useless as currency in 19th century Glasgow  However  the coin inspired him to take a position as cabin boy on a Clyde cattle ship to the United States to make his fortune at the age of 13  In 1898  after many adventures he finally ended up in Klondike  There he found a golden rock the size of a goose s egg  The next year he had made his first $1 000 000 and bought the deed for Killmule Hill from Casey Coot  the son of Clinton Coot and grandson of Cornelius Coot  He finally ended up in Duckburg in 1902  After some dramatic events where he faced both the Beagle Boys and president Roosevelt and his  Rough Riders  at the same time  he tore down the rest of the old fort Duckburg and raised his famous Money Bin at the same site  In the years to follow  Uncle Scrooge traveled all around the world in order to increase his fortune  During these and earlier travels he learned many different languages from all parts of the world  Meanwhile his family ran the Money Bin  When Scrooge finally returned to Duckburg  he found himself the richest duck in the world  rivaled only by Flintheart Glomgold  John D  Rockerduck and  less prominently  the maharaja of the fictional country Howdoyoustan  play on Hindustan   He had however changed  His newly developed personality   one that was a mix of hostility and crankiness made his own family leave him  12 years later  he closed his empire down  but eventually returned to a public life 5 years later and started his business   He keeps a portion of his wealth  money he has personally earned himself  in a massive Money Bin overlooking the city of Duckburg  In the short Scrooge McDuck and Money  he remarks to his nephews that this money is  just petty cash   In the Dutch and Italian version he regularly forces Donald and his nephews to polish the coins one by one in order to pay off Donald s debts—Scrooge will not even pay them much for this lengthy  tedious  hand breaking work  As far as he is concerned  even 5 cents an hour is too much expenditure   A shrewd businessduck and noted tightwad  he is fond of diving into his money  burrowing through it  swimming laps in it  spitting out coins that enter his mouth like water during these swimming sessions  and tossing coins into the air mirthfully only to let them fall upon his head — all without injury  He is also the richest member of The Billionaires Club of Duckburg  a society which includes the most successful businessmen of the world and allows them to keep connections with each other  Glomgold and Rockerduck are also influential members of the Club  His most famous prized possession is his Number One Dime   The sum of Scrooge s wealth is unclear  According to Barks  The Second Richest Duck as noted by a TIME article  Scrooge is worth one multiplujillion  nine obsquatumatillion  six hundred twenty three dollars and sixty two cents  In the DuckTales episode  Liquid Assets   Fenton Crackshell  Scrooge s accountant  notes that McDuck s money bin contains 607 tillion 386 zillion 947 trillion 522 billion dollars and 36 cents  Don Rosa s Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck notes that Scrooge amounts to five multiplujillion  nine impossibidillion  seven fantasticatrillion dollars and sixteen cents  A thought bubble from Scrooge McDuck sitting in his car with his Chauffeur in Walt Disney s Christmas Parade No 1  Published in 1949  that takes place in the story  Letter to Santa  clearly states  What s the use of having eleven octillion dollars if I don t make a big noise about it   Forbes has occasionally tried to estimate McDuck s wealth in real terms  in 2007  Forbes estimated his wealth at $28 8 billion  in 2011  it rose to $44 1 billion due to the rise in gold prices  One website used the size of Scrooge s Money Bin as a basis and calculated that it could contain over $27 trillion  Barks himself has said that the fortune is five billion quintiplitilion unptuplatillion multuplatillion impossibidillion fantasticatrillion dollars  Whatever the amount  Scrooge never considers it to be enough  he believes that he has to continue to earn money by any means possible  A running gag is Scrooge always making profit on any business deal   2 2  Education  Scrooge never completed a formal education  as he left school at an early age  However  he has a sharp mind and is always ready to learn new skills  Because of his secondary occupation as a treasure hunter  Scrooge has become something of a scholar and an amateur archaeologist  Starting with Barks  several writers have explained how Scrooge becomes aware of the treasures he decides to pursue  This often involves periods of research consulting various written sources in search of passages that might lead him to a treasure  Often Scrooge decides to search for the possible truth behind old legends  or discovers obscure references to the activities of ancient conquerors  explorers and military leaders that he considers interesting enough to begin a new expedition   As a result of his research  Scrooge has built up an extensive personal library  which includes many rare tomes  In Barks s and Rosa s stories  among the prized pieces of this library is an almost complete collection of Spanish and Dutch naval logs of the 16th and 17th centuries  Their references to the fates of other ships have often allowed Scrooge to locate sunken ships and recover their treasures from their watery graves  Mostly self taught as he is  Scrooge is a firm believer in the saying  knowledge is power   Scrooge is also an accomplished linguist and entrepreneur  having learned to speak several different languages during his business trips around the world  selling fridges to eskimos  wind to windmill manufacturers in the Netherlands etc   2 3  Morality and beliefs  Both as a businessman and as a treasure hunter  Scrooge is noted for his drive to set new goals and face new challenges  As Carl Barks described his character  for Scrooge there is  always another rainbow   The phrase later provided the title for one of Barks s better known paintings depicting Scrooge  Periods of inactivity between adventures and lack of serious challenges tend to be depressing for Scrooge after a while  some stories see these phases take a toll on his health  Scrooge s other motto is  Work smarter  not harder    As a businessman  Scrooge often resorts to aggressive tactics and deception  He seems to have gained significant experience in manipulating people and events towards his own ends  As often seen in stories by writer Guido Martina and occasionally by others  Scrooge is noted for his cynicism  especially towards ideals of morality when it comes to business and the pursuit of set goals  This has been noted by some as not being part of Barks s original profile of the character  but has since come to be accepted as one valid interpretation of Scrooge s way of thinking   Scrooge seems to have a personal code of honesty that offers him an amount of self control  He can often be seen contemplating the next course of action  divided between adopting a ruthless pursuit of his current goal against those tactics he considers more honest  At times  he can sacrifice his goal in order to remain within the limits of this sense of honesty  Several fans of the character have come to consider these depictions as adding to the depth of his personality  because based on the decisions he takes Scrooge can be both the hero and the villain of his stories  This is one thing he has in common with his nephew Donald  Scrooge s sense of honesty also distinguishes him from his rival Flintheart Glomgold  who places no such self limitations  During the cartoon series DuckTales  at times he would be heard saying to Glomgold   You re a cheater  and cheaters never prosper    Scrooge has a nasty temper and rarely hesitates to use violence against those who provoke his ire  often his nephew Donald  but also bill and tax collectors as well as door to door salesmen   however  he seems to be against the use of lethal force  On occasion  he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own  According to Scrooge s own explanation  this is to save himself from feelings of guilt over their deaths  he generally awaits no gratitude from them  Scrooge has also opined that only in fairy tales do bad people turn good  and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales  Scrooge believes in keeping his word—never breaking a promise once given  In Italian produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s  however  particularly those written by Guido Martina  Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions   Carl Barks gave Scrooge a definite set of ethics which were in tone with the time he was supposed to have made his fortune  The robber barons and industrialists of the 1890–1920s era were McDuck s competition as he earned his fortune  Scrooge proudly asserts  I made it by being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties  And I made it square   It is obvious that Barks s creation is averse to dishonesty in the pursuit of wealth  When Disney filmmakers first contemplated a Scrooge feature cartoon in the fifties  the animators had no understanding of the Scrooge McDuck character and merely envisioned Scrooge as a duck version of Ebenezer Scrooge—a very unsympathetic character  In the end they shelved the idea because a duck who gets all excited about money just was not funny enough   In an interview  Barks summed up his beliefs about Scrooge and capitalism   2 4  DuckTales  In the DuckTales series  Scrooge has adopted the nephews  as Donald has joined the Navy and is away on his tour of duty   and as a result his rougher edges are smoothed out somewhat  While most of his traits remain from the comics  he is notably more jovial and less irritable in the cartoon  In an early episode  Scrooge credits his improved temperament to the nephews and Webby  his housekeeper s granddaughter  who comes to live in Scrooge s mansion   saying that  for the first time since I left Scotland  I have a family   Though Scrooge is far from heartless in the comics  he is rarely so openly sentimental  While he still hunts for treasure in Ducktales  many episodes focus on him attempting to thwart villains  He remains  however  just as tightfisted with money as he has always been  Scrooge displays a strict code of honor  insisting that the only valid way to acquire wealth is to  earn it square   and he goes to great lengths to thwart those  sometimes even his own nephews  who gain money dishonestly  This code also prevents him from ever being dishonest himself  saying that  Scrooge McDuck s word is as good as gold   He also expresses great disgust at being viewed by others as a greedy liar and cheater  The show fleshed out his upbringing depicting his life as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest  a value he teaches his nephews  Also it was shown that money is no longer the most important thing in his life  For one episode he was under a love spell  which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess  over everything else  The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell  is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love  The boys make it appear that Scrooge s love is allergic to money  however  he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her  Later  when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her  the spell is immediately broken  showing that family is the most important thing to him  On occasion he demonstrates physical fitness by single handedly beating bigger foes  He credits his strength to  lifting money bags    2 5  Europe  Many of the European comics based on the Disney Universe have created their own version of Scrooge McDuck  usually involving him in slapstick adventures  This is particularly true of the Italian comics which were very popular in the 1960s  70s and 80s in most parts of Western continental Europe  In these  Scrooge is mainly an anti hero dragging his long suffering nephews into treasure hunts and shady business deals  Donald is a reluctant participant in these travels  only agreeing to go along when his uncle reminds him of the debts and back rent Donald owes him  threatens him with a sword or blunderbuss or offers a share of the loot  When he promises Donald a share of the treasure  Scrooge will add a little loophole in the terms which may seem obscure at first but which he brings up at the end of the adventure to deny Donald his share  keeping the whole for himself  After Donald risks life and limb — something which Scrooge shows little concern for — he tends to end up with nothing   Another running joke is Scrooge reminiscing on his adventures while gold prospecting in the Klondike much to Donald and the nephews  chagrin at hearing the never ending and tiresome stories   2 6  Age  Scrooge s age has never been specified  although according to Barks  Scrooge was born in Scotland in 1867  and earned his Number One Dime exactly ten years later  Although Rosa stated that Scrooge died at the age of 100  that has never been published in the comics  The DuckTales episodes show a Scrooge who hailed from Scotland in the 19th Century  yet was clearly familiar with all the technology and amenities of the 1980s  Despite this case of extreme old age  Scrooge has not appeared to be on dotage s door  and has been strong enough to keep up with his nephews in adventures  with rare exception there appears to be no sign of him slowing down  Barks explained to some fan letters asking about Scrooge s Adamic age that in the story  That s No Fable    where Scrooge drank water from a Fountain of Youth for several days  rather than making him young again  bodily contact with the water was required for that   ingesting the water rejuvenated his body and cured him of his rheumatia  which arguably allowed Scrooge to live beyond his expected years with no sign of slowdown or senility   3  Impact  3 1  Scrooge McDuck Universe  The popularity of Scrooge McDuck comics spawned an entire mythology around the character  including new supporting characters  adventures  and life experiences as told by numerous authors  The popularity of the Duck universe   the fandom term for the associated intellectual properties that have developed from Scrooge s stories over the years  including the city of Duckburg   has led Don Rosa to claim that  in the beginning Scrooge  owed  his existence to his nephew Donald  but that has changed and today it s Donald that  owes  his existence to Scrooge    In addition to the many original and existing characters in stories about Scrooge McDuck  authors have frequently led historical figures to meet Scrooge over the course of his life  Most notably  Scrooge has met U S  president Theodore Roosevelt  Roosevelt and Scrooge would meet each other at least three times  in the Dakotas in 1883  in Duckburg in 1902  and in Panama in 1906  See Historical Figures in Scrooge McDuck stories   Based on writer Don Rosa s The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck  a popular timeline chronicling Scrooge s adventures was created consisting of the most important  facts  about Scrooge s life  See Scrooge McDuck Timeline according to Don Rosa   In 2014  composer Tuomas Holopainen of Nightwish released a conceptual album based on the book  The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck  The album is titled Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge  Don Rosa illustrated the cover artwork for the album   3 2  In other media  The character of Scrooge has appeared in various mediums aside from comic books  Scrooge s first appearance in animated form  save for a brief Mickey Mouse Club television series cameo  was in Disney s 1967 theatrical short Scrooge McDuck and Money  in which he teaches his nephews basic financial tips   He later appeared as Ebenezer Scrooge in Mickey s Christmas Carol  1983   an animated version of the Dickens classic  In this adaptation Scrooge s character is voiced by co writer Alan Young  He also appeared as himself in the television special Sport Goofy in Soccermania  1983   the only time when he was voiced by Will Ryan    Scrooge s biggest role outside comics would come in the 1987 animated series DuckTales  a series loosely based on Carl Barks s comics  and where Alan Young returned to voice his character  In this series  premiered over two hours on September 18  1987  while the regular episodes began three days later  Scrooge becomes caretaker of Huey  Dewey and Louie when Donald joins the United States Navy  Scrooge s DuckTales persona is considerably softer than in most previous appearances  his ruthlessness is played down considerably and his often abrasive personality is reduced in many episodes to that of a crotchety but lovable old uncle  Still  there are flashes of Barks  Scrooge to be seen  particularly in early episodes of the first season  After the series Scrooge also appeared in DuckTales the Movie  Treasure of the Lost Lamp  He was mentioned in the Darkwing Duck episode  Tiff of the Titans   but never really seen   He has appeared in some episodes of Raw Toonage  two shorts of Mickey Mouse Works and some episodes  specially  House of Scrooge   of Disney s House of Mouse  as well as the direct to video films Mickey s Once Upon a Christmas and Mickey s Twice Upon a Christmas  His video game appearances include the three DuckTales releases  DuckTales  DuckTales 2  and DuckTales   the Quest for Gold   and in Toontown Online as the accidental creator of the Cogs  Additionally  he is a secret playable character in 2008 quiz game  Disney TH NK Fast  In the 2012 Nintendo 3DS game Epic Mickey  Power of Illusion  he is one of the first characters Mickey rescues  running a shop in the fortress selling upgrades and serving as a Sketch summon in which he uses his

how Scrooge builds a rocket to send all his money to the moon to protect it from the  Beagle Boys    Scrooge also makes an appearance in Disney s and Square Enix s Kingdom Hearts series  in a role where he helps Mickey Mouse set up a world transit system  He first appears in Kingdom Hearts II as a minor non playable character in Hollow Bastion  where he is trying to recreate his favorite ice cream flavor – sea salt  Scrooge later appears in the prequel  Kingdom Hearts  Birth by Sleep  this time with a speaking role  He s working on establishing an ice cream business in Radiant Garden and gives Ventus three passes to the Dream Festival in Disney Town  Young reprises the role in the English version of Birth by Sleep   Scrooge has appeared in the Boom  Studios Darkwing Duck comic

Duck in order to stop the Phantom Blot and Magica De Spell from taking over St  Canard and Duckburg   4  In popular culture  Forbes magazine routinely lists Scrooge McDuck on its annual  Fictional 15  list of the richest fictional characters by net worth   In tribute to its famous native  Glasgow City Council added Scrooge to its list of  Famous Glaswegians  in 2007  alongside the likes of Billy Connolly and Charles Rennie Mackintosh   In 2008 The Weekly Standard parodied the bailout of the financial markets by publishing a memo where Scrooge applies to the TARP program   An extortionist
