In Norse mythology  Ragnarök is a series of future events  including a great battle foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures  including the gods Odin  Thor  Týr  Freyr  Heimdallr  and Loki   the occurrence of various natural disasters  and the subsequent submersion of the world in water  Afterward  the world will resurface anew and fertile  the surviving and returning gods will meet  and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors  Ragnarök is an important event in the Norse canon  and has been the subject of scholarly discourse and theory   The event is attested primarily in the Poetic Edda  compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources  and the Prose Edda  written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson  In the Prose Edda  and a single poem in the Poetic Edda  the event is referred to as Ragnarök or Ragnarøkkr  Old Norse  Fate of the Gods  and  Twilight of the Gods  respectively   a usage popularized by 19th century composer Richard Wagner with the title of the last of his Der Ring des Nibelungen operas  Götterdämmerung  1876    1  Etymology  The Old Norse compound ragnarok has a long history of interpretation  Its first element  ragna  is unproblematic  being the genitive plural of regin  n  pl    the ruling powers  gods   The second element is more difficult  as it occurs in two variants   rök and  røkkr  Zoega s Old Icelandic Dictionary treats the two forms as two separate compounds  glossing ragnarök as  the doom or destruction of the gods  and ragnarøkkr as  the twilight of the gods   1910    The plural noun rök  has several meanings  such as  development  origin  cause  relation  fate   The word ragnarök as a whole is then usually interpreted as the  final destiny of the gods    The singular form ragnarøk k r is found in stanza 39 of the Poetic Edda poem Lokasenna  and in the Prose Edda  The noun røkr  røkkr means  twilight   from a verb røkkva  to grow dark    suggesting a translation  twilight of the gods   This reading was widely considered a folk etymological corruption  or a learned reinterpretation  of the original term due to the merger of  ǫ  and  ø  in Old Icelandic after ca  1200  nevertheless giving rise to the concept of Götterdämmerung  Twilight of the Gods  in the German reception of Norse mythology   Nevertheless  Haraldur Bernharðsson in a 2007 paper suggested that the singular form  røkr  twilight   from a Proto Germanic *rekwa  might have been the original reading  Haraldur Bernharðsson argues instead that the words ragnarök and ragnarøkkr are closely related  etymologically and semantically  and suggests a meaning of  renewal of the divine powers    Other terms used to refer to the events surrounding Ragnarök in the Poetic Edda include aldar rök  aldar means age   end of an age   from stanza 39 of Vafþrúðnismál  tíva rök from stanzas 38 and 42 of Vafþrúðnismál  þá er regin deyja   when the gods die   from Vafþrúðnismál stanza 47  unz um rjúfask regin   when the gods will be destroyed   from Vafþrúðnismál stanza 52  Lokasenna stanza 41  and Sigrdrífumál stanza 19  aldar rof   destruction of the age   from Helgakviða Hundingsbana II stanza 41  regin þrjóta   end of the gods   from Hyndluljóð stanza 42  and  in the Prose Edda  þá er Muspellz synir herja   when the sons of Muspell move into battle   can be found in chapters 18 and 36 of Gylfaginning   2  Attestations  2 1  Poetic Edda  The Poetic Edda contains various references to Ragnarök   2 1 1  Völuspá  In the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá  references to Ragnarök begin from stanza 40 until 58  with the rest of the poem describing the aftermath  In the poem  a völva recites information to Odin  In stanza 41  the völva says   The völva then describes three roosters crowing  In stanza 42  the jötunn herdsman Eggthér sits on a mound and cheerfully plays his harp while the crimson rooster Fjalar  Old Norse  hider  deceiver   crows in the forest Gálgviðr  The golden rooster Gullinkambi crows to the Æsir in Valhalla  and the third  unnamed soot red rooster crows in the halls of the underworld location of Hel in stanza 43   After these stanzas  the völva further relates that the hound Garmr produces deep howls in front of the cave of Gnipahellir  Garmr s bindings break and he runs free  The völva describes the state of humanity   The  sons of Mím  are described as being  at play   though this reference is not further explained in surviving sources  Heimdall raises the Gjallarhorn into the air and blows deeply into it  and Odin converses with Mím s head  The world tree Yggdrasil shudders and groans  The jötunn Hrym comes from the east  his shield before him  The Midgard serpent Jörmungandr furiously writhes  causing waves to crash   The eagle shrieks  pale beaked he tears the corpse   and the ship Naglfar breaks free thanks to the waves made by Jormungandr and sets sail from the east  The fire jötnar inhabitants of Muspelheim come forth   The völva continues that Jötunheimr  the land of the jötnar  is aroar  and that the Æsir are in council  The dwarves groan by their stone doors  Surtr advances from the south  his sword brighter than the sun  Rocky cliffs open and the jötnar women sink  People walk the road to Hel and the heavens split apart   The gods then do battle with the invaders  Odin is swallowed whole and alive fighting the wolf Fenrir  causing his wife Frigg her second great sorrow  the first being the death of her son  the god Baldr   Odin s son Víðarr avenges his father by rending Fenrir s jaws apart and stabbing it in the heart with his spear  thus killing the wolf  The serpent Jörmungandr opens its gaping maw  yawning widely in the air  and is met in combat by Thor  Thor  also a son of Odin and described here as protector of the earth  furiously fights the serpent  defeating it  but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterward before collapsing  The god Freyr fights Surtr and loses  After this  people flee their homes  and the sun becomes black while the earth sinks into the sea  the stars vanish  steam rises  and flames touch the heavens   The völva sees the earth reappearing from the water  and an eagle over a waterfall hunting fish on a mountain  The surviving Æsir meet together at the field of Iðavöllr  They discuss Jörmungandr  great events of the past  and the runic alphabet  In stanza 61  in the grass  they find the golden game pieces that the gods are described as having once happily enjoyed playing games with long ago  attested earlier in the same poem   The reemerged fields grow without needing to be sown  The gods Höðr and Baldr return from Hel and live happily together   The völva says that the god Hœnir chooses wooden slips for divination  and that the sons of two brothers will widely inhabit the windy world  She sees a hall thatched with gold in Gimlé  where nobility will live and spend their lives pleasurably  Stanzas 65  found in the Hauksbók version of the poem  refers to a  powerful  mighty one  that  rules over everything  and who will arrive from above at the court of the gods  Old Norse regindómr   which has been interpreted as a Christian addition to the poem  In stanza 66  the völva ends her account with a description of the dragon Níðhöggr  corpses in his jaws  flying through the air  The völva then  sinks down   It is unclear if stanza 66 indicates that the völva is referring to the present time or if this is an element of the post Ragnarök world   2 1 2  Vafþrúðnismál  The Vanir god Njörðr is mentioned in relation to Ragnarök in stanza 39 of the poem Vafþrúðnismál  In the poem  Odin  disguised as  Gagnráðr  faces off with the wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir in a battle of wits  Vafþrúðnismál references Njörðr s status as a hostage during the earlier Æsir Vanir War  and that he will  come back home among the wise Vanir  at  the doom of men    In stanza 44  Odin poses the question to Vafþrúðnir as to who of mankind will survive the  famous  Fimbulvetr   Mighty Winter    Vafþrúðnir responds in stanza 45 that those survivors will be Líf and Lífþrasir  and that they will hide in the forest of Hoddmímis holt  that they will consume the morning dew  and will produce generations of offspring  In stanza 46  Odin asks what sun will come into the sky after Fenrir has consumed the sun that exists  Vafþrúðnir responds that Sól will bear a daughter before Fenrir assails her  and that after Ragnarök this daughter will continue her mother s path   In stanza 51  Vafþrúðnir states that  after Surtr s flames have been sated  Odin s sons Víðarr and Váli will live in the temples of the gods  and that Thor s sons Móði and Magni will possess the hammer Mjolnir  In stanza 52  the disguised Odin asks the jötunn about Odin s own fate  Vafþrúðnir responds that  the wolf  will consume Odin  and that Víðarr will avenge him by sundering its cold jaws in battle  Odin ends the duel with one final question  what did Odin say to his son before preparing his funeral pyre  With this  Vafþrúðnir realizes that he is dealing with none other than Odin  whom he refers to as  the wisest of beings   adding that Odin alone could know this  Odin s message has been interpreted as a promise of resurrection to Baldr after Ragnarök   2 1 3  Helgakviða Hundingsbana II  Ragnarök is briefly referenced in stanza 40 of the poem Helgakviða Hundingsbana II  Here  the valkyrie Sigrún s unnamed maid is passing the deceased hero Helgi Hundingsbane s burial mound  Helgi is there with a retinue of men  surprising the maid  The maid asks if she is witnessing a delusion since she sees dead men riding  or if Ragnarök has occurred  In stanza 41  Helgi responds that it is neither   2 2  Prose Edda  Snorri Sturluson s Prose Edda quotes heavily from Völuspá and elaborates extensively in prose on the information there  though some of this information conflicts with that provided in Völuspá   2 2 1  Gylfaginning chapters 26 and 34  In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning  various references are made to Ragnarök  Ragnarök is first mentioned in chapter 26  where the throned figure of High  king of the hall  tells Gangleri  King Gylfi in disguise  some basic information about the goddess Iðunn  including that her apples will keep the gods young until Ragnarök   In chapter 34  High describes the binding of the wolf Fenrir by the gods  causing the god Týr to lose his right hand  and that Fenrir remains there until Ragnarök  Gangleri asks High why  since the gods could only expect destruction from Fenrir  they did not simply kill Fenrir once he was bound  High responds that  the gods hold their sacred places and sanctuaries in such respect that they chose not to defile them with the wolf s blood  even though the prophecies foretold that he would be the death of Odin    As a consequence of his role in the death of the god Baldr  Loki  described as father of Fenrir  is bound on top of three stones with the internal organs of his son Narfi  which are turned into iron  in three places  There  venom drops onto his face periodically from a snake placed by the jötunn Skaði  and when his wife Sigyn empties the bucket she is using to collect the dripping venom  the pain he experiences causes convulsions  resulting in earthquakes  Loki is further described as being bound this way until the onset of Ragnarök   2 2 2  Gylfaginning chapter 51  Chapter 51 provides a detailed account of Ragnarök interspersed with various quotes from Völuspá  while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events  In Chapter 51  High states the first sign of Ragnarök will be Fimbulvetr  during which time three winters will arrive without a summer  and the sun will be useless  High details that  prior to these winters  three earlier winters will have occurred  marked with great battles throughout the world  During this time  greed will cause brothers to kill brothers  and fathers and sons will suffer from the collapse of kinship bonds  High then quotes stanza 45 of Völuspá  Next  High describes that the wolf will first swallow the sun  and then his brother the moon  and mankind will consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin  The stars will disappear  The earth and mountains will shake so violently that the trees will come loose from the soil  the mountains will topple  and all restraints will break  causing Fenrir to break free from his bonds   High relates that the great serpent Jörmungandr  also described as a child of Loki in the same source  will breach land as the sea violently swells onto it  The ship Naglfar  described in the Prose Edda as being made from the human nails of the dead  is released from its mooring  and sets sail on the surging sea  steered by a jötunn named Hrym  At the same time  Fenrir  eyes and nostrils spraying flames  charges forward with his mouth wide open  his upper jaw reaching to the heavens  his lower jaw touching the earth  At Fenrir s side  Jörmungandr sprays venom throughout the air and the sea   During all of this  the sky splits into two  From the split  the  sons of Muspell  ride forth  Surtr rides first  surrounded by flames  his sword brighter than the sun  High says that  Muspell s sons  will ride across Bifröst  described in Gylfaginning as a rainbow bridge  and that the bridge will then break  The sons of Muspell  and their shining battle troop  advance to the field of Vígríðr  described as an expanse that reaches  a hundred leagues in each direction   where Fenrir  Jörmungandr  Loki  followed by  Hel s own    and Hrym  accompanied by all frost jötnar  join them  While this occurs  Heimdallr stands and blows the Gjallarhorn with all his might  The gods awaken at the sound  and they meet  Odin rides to Mímir s Well in search of counsel from Mímir  Yggdrasil shakes  and everything  everywhere fears  High relates that the Æsir and the Einherjar dress for war and head to the field  Odin  wearing a gold helmet and an intricate coat of mail  carries his spear Gungnir and rides before them  Odin advances against Fenrir  while Thor moves at his side  though Thor is unable to assist Odin because he has engaged Jörmungandr in combat  According to High  Freyr fiercely fights with Surtr  but Freyr falls because he lacks the sword he once gave to his messenger  Skirnir  The hound Garmr  described here as the  worst of monsters   breaks free from his bonds in front of Gnipahellir  and fights the god Týr  resulting in both of their deaths   Thor kills Jörmungandr  yet is poisoned by the serpent  and manages to walk nine steps before falling to the earth dead  Fenrir swallows Odin  though immediately afterward his son Víðarr kicks his foot into Fenrir s lower jaw  grips Fenrir s upper jaw  and rips apart Fenrir s mouth  killing Fenrir  Loki fights Heimdallr  and the two kill one another  Surtr covers the earth in fire  causing the entire world to burn  High quotes stanzas 46 to 47 of Völuspá  and additionally stanza 18 of Vafþrúðnismál  the latter relating information about the battlefield Vígríðr    2 2 3  Gylfaginning chapters 52 and 53  At the beginning of chapter 52  Gangleri asks  what will be after heaven and earth and the whole world are burned  All the gods will be dead  together with the Einherjar and the whole of mankind  Didn t you say earlier that each person will live in some world throughout all ages    The figure of Third  seated on the highest throne in the hall  responds that there will be many good places to live  but also many bad ones  Third states that the best place to be is Gimlé in the heavens  where a place exists called Okolnir that houses a hall called Brimir—where one can find plenty to drink  Third describes a hall made of red gold located in Niðafjöll called Sindri  where  good and virtuous men will live   Third further relates an unnamed hall in Náströnd  the beaches of the dead  that he describes as a large repugnant hall facing north that is built from the spines of snakes  and resembles  a house with walls woven from branches   the heads of the snakes face the inside of the house and spew so much venom that rivers of it flow throughout the hall  in which oath breakers and murderers must wade  Third here quotes Völuspá stanzas 38 to 39  with the insertion of original prose stating that the worst place of all to be is in Hvergelmir  followed by a quote from Völuspá to highlight that the dragon Níðhöggr harasses the corpses of the dead there   Chapter 53 begins with Gangleri asking if any of the gods will survive  and if there will be anything left of the earth or the sky  High responds that the earth will appear once more from the sea  beautiful and green  where self sown crops grow  The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard once was  and  there  untouched by Surtr s flames  Víðarr and Váli reside  Now possessing their father s hammer Mjolnir  Thor s sons Móði and Magni will meet them there  and  coming from Hel  Baldr  and Höðr also arrive  Together  they all sit and recount memories  later finding the gold game pieces the Æsir once owned  Völuspá stanza 51 is then quoted   High reveals that two humans  Líf and Lífþrasir  will have also survived the destruction by hiding in the wood Hoddmímis holt  These two survivors consume the morning dew for sustenance  and from their descendants the world will be repopulated  Vafþrúðnismál stanza 45 is then quoted  The personified sun  Sól  will have a daughter at least as beautiful as she  and this daughter will follow the same path as her mother  Vafþrúðnismál stanza 47 is quoted  and so ends the foretelling of Ragnarök in Gylfaginning   3  Archaeological record  Various objects have been identified as depicting events from Ragnarök   3 1  Thorwald s Cross  Thorwald s Cross  a partially surviving runestone erected at Kirk Andreas on the Isle of Man  depicts a bearded human holding a spear downward at a wolf  his right foot in its mouth  while a large bird sits at his shoulder  Rundata dates it to 940  while Pluskowski dates it to the 11th century  This depiction has been interpreted as Odin  with a raven or eagle at his shoulder  being consumed by Fenrir at Ragnarök  On the other side of the stone is a depiction of a large cross and another image parallel to the Odin figure that has been described as Christ triumphing over Satan  These combined elements have led to the cross as being described as  syncretic art   a mixture of pagan and Christian beliefs   3 2  Gosforth Cross  The Gosforth Cross  920–950   in Cumbria  England  is a standing cross of a typical Anglo Saxon form  carved on all sides of the long shaft  which is nearly square in section  Apart from panels of ornament  the scenes include a Christian Crucifixion  and possibly another scene in Hell  but the other scenes are generally interpreted as narrative incidents from the Ragnarök story  even by a scholar as cautious of such interpretations as David M  Wilson  The Ragnarök battle itself may be depicted on the north side  The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style  including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head  one of whose feet is thrust into the beast s forked tongue and on its lower jaw  while the other is placed against its upper jaw  a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir   3 3  Ledberg stone  The 11th century Ledberg stone in Sweden  similarly to Thorwald s Cross  features a figure with his foot at the mouth of a four legged beast  and this may also be a depiction of Odin being devoured by Fenrir at Ragnarök  Below the beast and the man is a depiction of a legless  helmeted man  with his arms in a prostrate position  The Younger Futhark inscription on the stone bears a commonly seen memorial dedication  but is followed by an encoded runic sequence that has been described as  mysterious   and  an interesting magic formula which is known from all over the ancient Norse world    3 4  Skarpåker stone  On the early 11th century Skarpåker Stone  from Södermanland  Sweden  a father grieving his dead son used the same verse form as in the Poetic Edda in the following engraving   Jansson  1987  notes that at the time of the inscription  everyone who read the lines would have thought of Ragnarök and the allusion that the father found fitting as an expression of his grief   4  Theories and interpretations  4 1  Cyclical time  Rudolf Simek theorizes that the survival of Líf and Lífþrasir at the end Ragnarök is  a case of reduplication of the anthropogeny  understandable from the cyclic nature of the Eddic eschatology   Simek says that Hoddmímis holt  should not be understood literally as a wood or even a forest in which the two keep themselves hidden  but rather as an alternative name for the world tree Yggdrasill  Thus  the creation of mankind from tree trunks  Askr  Embla  is repeated after the Ragnarǫk as well   Simek says that in Germanic regions  the concept of mankind originating from trees is ancient  and additionally points out legendary parallels in a Bavarian legend of a shepherd who lives inside a tree  whose descendants repopulate the land after life there has been wiped out by plague  citing a retelling by F  R  Schröder   In addition  Simek points to an Old Norse parallel in the figure of Örvar Oddr   who is rejuvenated after living as a tree man  Ǫrvar Odds saga 24–27     4 2  Muspille  Heliand  and Christianity  Theories have been proposed about the relation to Ragnarök and the 9th century Old High German epic poem Muspilli about the Christian Last Judgment  where the word Muspille appears  and the 9th century Old Saxon epic poem Heliand about the life of Christ  where various other forms of the word appear  In both sources  the word is used to signify the end of the world through fire  Old Norse forms of the term also appear throughout accounts of Ragnarök  where the world is also consumed in flames  and  though various theories exist about the meaning and origins of the term  its etymology has not been solved   4 3  Proto Indo European basis  Parallels have been pointed out between the Ragnarök of the Norse pagans and the beliefs of other related Indo European peoples  Subsequently  theories have been put forth that Ragnarök represents a later evolution of a Proto Indo European belief along with other cultures descending from the Proto Indo Europeans  These parallels include comparisons of a cosmic winter motif between the Norse Fimbulwinter  the Iranian Bundahishn and Yima  Víðarr s stride has been compared to the Vedic god Vishnu in that both have a  cosmic stride  with a special shoe used to tear apart a beastly wolf  Larger patterns have also been drawn between  final battle  events in Indo European cultures  including the occurrence of a blind or semi blind figure in  final battle  themes  and figures appearing suddenly with surprising skills   4 4  Volcanic eruptions  Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that the events in Völuspá occurring after the death of the gods  the sun turning black  steam rising  flames touching the heavens  etc   may be inspired by the volcanic eruptions on Iceland  Records of eruptions on Iceland bear strong similarities to the sequence of events described in Völuspá  especially the eruption at Laki that occurred in 1783  Bertha Phillpotts theorizes that the figure of Surtr was inspired by Icelandic eruptions  and that he was a volcano demon  Surtr s name occurs in some Icelandic place names  among them the lava tube caves Surtshellir  a number of dark caverns in the volcanic central region of Iceland   4 5  Bergbúa þáttr  Parallels have been pointed out between a poem spoken by a jötunn found in the 13th century þáttr Bergbúa þáttr   the tale of the mountain dweller    In the tale  Thórd and his servant get lost while traveling to church in winter  and so take shelter for the night within a cave  Inside the cave they hear noises  witness a pair of immense burning eyes  and then the being with burning eyes recites a poem of 12 stanzas  The poem the being recites contains references to Norse mythology  including a mention of Thor  and also prophecies  including that  mountains will tumble  the earth will move  men will be scoured by hot water and burned by fire    Surtr s fire receives a mention in stanza 10  John Lindow says that the poem may describe  a mix of the destruction of the race of giants and of humans  as in Ragnarök  but that  many of the predictions of disruption on earth could also fit the volcanic activity that is so common in Iceland    5  Modern influence  In late 2013 and early 2014  it was widely reported in English language media outlets that Ragnarök would occur on February 22  2014  Apparently patterned after the 2012 phenomenon  the claim was at times attributed to a  Viking Calendar   No such calendar is known to have existed  and the source was a  prediction  made to media outlets by the Jorvik Viking Centre in York  England  and intended to draw attention to an event that the institution was to hold on that date  The Jorvik Viking Centre was criticized for intentionally or unintentionally misleading the public  however  in an article on the incident  Joseph S  Hopkins perceives the media response as an example of a broad revival of interest in the Viking Age and ancient Germanic topics   6  Notes  7  References  Rundata 2 0 for Windows
