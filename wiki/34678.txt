500 or Five Hundred is a trick taking game that is an extension of Euchre with some ideas from Bridge  For two to six players it is most commonly played by four players in partnerships but is sometimes recommended as a good three player game  It arose in America before 1900 and was promoted by the United States Playing Card Company  who copyrighted and marketed the rules in 1904  500 is a social card game and was highly popular in the United States until around 1920 when first Auction bridge and then Contract Bridge drove it from favour  It continued to enjoy popularity in Australia  New Zealand and Quebec   1  Setup  Of the many variants to 500  the standard deck contains 43 playing cards  a Joker is included  sometimes two  in which case the black and white joker beats the coloured one   and the 2s  3s  and two 4s are removed  Either the two black 4s are removed  or the 4 of spades and 4 of diamonds are removed  in which case the 4 that matches the trump color is also considered trump  so that there are always 13 trump cards  14 when using two jokers   Cards are dealt to each of the four players and three  four with two jokers  are dealt face down on the table to form the kitty  also known as the widow or blind   Alternatively  a 45 card deck can be used  46 with two jokers   in which case the 4s are not removed  Each player still receives a hand of 10 cards  but the kitty is increased to five cards  six with two jokers    Players play in pairs  usually opposite each other  Traditionally  a bundle of three cards is dealt to each player  one to the kitty  a bundle of four to each player  one to the kitty  a bundle of three to each player  one to the kitty or with a 45 card deck  the deal is performed by dealing three cards to each player  then placing three cards in the kitty  four cards each and two to the kitty  and then three   As in Euchre  in non trump suits  the order of cards from highest to lowest is Ace  King  Queen   Jack   10  9  8  7  6  5   4   In the trump suit  the highest card is the Joker  sometimes known as best bower in reference to the trump Jacks  followed by the Jack of the trump suit called right bower  and then the Jack of the suit of the same color as the trump suit called left bower  which is considered part of the trump suit  followed by the Ace  King  Queen  10  9  8  7  6  5   4    Bower is an Anglicization of the German Bauer  a word meaning farmer  peasant  or pawn  This name is often used to refer to the Jack of German games   2  Bidding  After people do deal  players call in turn  electing either to bid or to pass  A bid indicates the combined number of tricks the bidder believes he and his partner will take and the suit that will be trumps for that hand  or that there will be no trump suit  For instance  a bid of  seven spades  indicates that the player intends to win seven or more tricks with spades being the trump suit  whereas a bid of  seven no trumps  indicates that the player intends to win seven or more tricks with no trump suit  in which case the only trump card is the joker    In American play  a bid of six is called  cheating   A player who bids  inkle spades  is indicating to their partner that they have some spades but not enough to bid seven  Only the first two players may inkle   A player may elect not to bid  or to  pass   Bidding proceeds clockwise around the table  with each player passing or making a higher scoring bid  A player who passes cannot subsequently make a bid in that hand   A player who has bid may only bid again in that hand if there has been an intervening bid by another player  However  in some variations a player who has bid and not passed may always bid again in that hand   The order of seniority of suits in bidding  highest to lowest  as reflected in the scores below  is hearts  diamonds  clubs  spades  Therefore  for example  a player who bids  seven clubs  may be outbid by a subsequent bidding player on seven diamonds or seven hearts  but not seven spades  A  no trumps  bid beats any suited bid of the same number  Inkles are typically also similarly ranked  If the first player bids  six hearts   the next player cannot inkle spades  clubs  or diamonds  Their only options are to inkle no trump  bid seven or more  of any suit  or no trump or Misère   or pass  Eventually  all but one player passes and the bid is decided   In American play  there is only one round of bidding  with each player getting one chance  in turn  to either bid or pass  The player making the successful bid then collects the kitty  This player sorts through his hand and discards the least useful three  or five in the case of a 45 card deck  cards  possibly including cards picked up from the kitty   and places them face down  the discarded cards playing no further part in the hand   If nobody makes a bid  there are multiple variations  Most commonly  the hand is declared dead and a reshuffle and re deal is made  This can be repeated only twice  after which the deal passes to the next player  Alternatively  the game is played where no bids mean the round is played as no trumps  and scoring is ten points per trick  Other variations include that the deal passes to the next player  no reshuffle   or that if no one else makes a bid  the dealer is required to make a bid   2 1  Special bids  No trump means that the joker is the only trump card  there are no bowers and no trump suit when playing no trump or  no ies     J5 is a special version of no trump where a jack replaces the ace as the highest card of its respective suit  keeping the rules in line with a suited game  The joker remains the only trump card  and the normal agreed upon rules of its use still apply  In a J5 game there is no lower bower  e g   the jack of diamonds is not considered a heart and so on   Other cards follow their typical hierarchy   A Misère  also called Nulot  Nullo  Nula or Nello  bid means the bidding player is trying to not win any tricks  If playing with a partner  the partner folds his cards and does not participate in the round  Misère is the French word meaning  extreme poverty   It can only be bid after a 7 bid and before an 8 bid  However  because Misère is worth 250 points  and an 8 Spades bid is worth 240 points  players must decide before the start of play if the 8 Spades bet can beat a Misère since it is worth fewer points but it is considered  over  the Misère  Alternatively  this bid need not wait until after a 7 bid and always beats 8 Spades   Open Misère is the same as misère except the player playing this bid must reveal all of his cards to his opponents after the first trick  It can only be bid after an 8 bid  and is one of the highest bids which can only be beaten by a 10 No Trump bet  Also called Lay Down Misère   Blind Misère is the same as misère except the bid must be called before the player views his cards   Double nullo is an American variant in which both players of the bidding team play and must not win any tricks  This is also called Grand nullo  which is often corrupted to Granola   Shields Double is a variant of Double nullo where one partner of the bidding team plays his hand open  after the initial trick    Patastrophe is an Open Misère where both partners on the bidding team play  with both calling partners playing their hand open  after the first trick   Patastrophe is worth 1 000 points   The Wilkinson version of Misère is agreed to before the outset of the game  and is bid as such   closed misère  can be bid any time  even as a first bid  but is played open  and  open misère  may also be bid likewise but is played open and without the kitty   Hi Lo or 5 and 5 bid means one player intends to win 5 tricks and lose 5 tricks in the hand  The game is typically worth 350 points  and therefore outbids a 9 black bid  but not a 9 red bid  The game play is similar to a No trump game in that the Joker is the only trump card and may only be used if the player cannot otherwise follow suit  When a Hi Lo call is made the bidder s partner folds his cards and does not participate in the hand   Ralphing is when a person that bids gets set by more than 3 tricks  i e  A person wins the bid with 9 hearts but only takes 6  or bids Nullo and takes 3 or more tricks   In the event that a person is Ralphed  they are not allowed to bid in the next hand  The name comes from a person that would repeatedly over bid and lose dreadfully each time  The rule was instituted so others would be allowed to win bids   Sans Kitty  Any player may make a contract bid for six or more tricks  misère  open misère  or double misère sans kitty  often just stated as sans   Sans kitty indicates that the bidding team will fulfill its contract without the use of the kitty  A sans bid must be included in the original bid  and cannot be added after having viewed the kitty  This typically adds 40 points to the total bid  While sans adds extra points onto the total of a bid  it is not necessary for an opposing team to account for those points when attempting to outbid another team  For example  a bid of six no trump sans kitty can still be outbid by seven clubs   Slam  If  after picking up the kitty  a player who bid a seven trick contract  but not over seven and not misère  feels that he could win all ten tricks  he may call for a slam hand  The partner of the player who calls for a slam passes a single card to his partner then folds his hand and does not play  The contractor who called for the slam hand must discard until he has only 10 cards remaining before starting play  The contractor must then win all ten tricks  or lose the point value of the bid  plus 100 points  Because the total value of the slam hand is the same as the value of a bid of eight in the same suit  it is not advantageous for a player to intentionally underbid a hand in order to make a slam bid  For a variation on the Slam rule  see the  Variations in score keeping  section   2 2  Special inkles  Inkle No is sometimes distinguished from Inkle No Trump  with the former meaning the player has high cards and the latter meaning he has the joker  Inkle No Trump is the highest inkle  However  such a distinction is often forbidden and considered to be illegal table talk  with the only legal No Trump inkle being the full  Inkle No Trump   and with the player s partner left to determine whether the inkle means his partner has high cards  the joker  both  or that he is simply blocking the opponents from inkling   Players cannot Inkle Nullo   Some versions allow bids of 6 tricks  but others consider them only equal to inkles   3  Gameplay  The game focuses on tricks  The lead starts with the player who won the bidding  In some variations  the player to the dealer s left leads first regardless of who won the bid  Players must follow suit if they can  This includes the left bower or any other card that is considered a trump  if trumps are led   If a player no longer has any cards of the suit that is led  he may play any card in his hand  After all four players have played a card  the highest trump takes the trick  If no trumps are played  the highest card of the lead suit wins the trick  The winner of the trick leads on the next trick  Once all ten tricks have been played  the hand is scored  The player to the left of the previous dealer deals for the next hand  so that the deal moves clockwise around the table   Double nullo may be called by one partner even if the other partner passes  In this instance the player who calls nullo draws in his her partner and both must play and not take any tricks  The person who calls double nullo picks up the kitty and gives the five cards he she wants to discard to their partner  Their partner then must take those five cards and pick the ones he she wants to keep and discard the rest   4  Variations  Variations exist  with appropriate additions or deductions to the deck for playing three  five or six handed 500  Three handed uses no teams  five handed teams rotate and each player takes a turn without a partner  six handed can be played as either three teams of two or two teams of three  Six handed 500 requires a special deck with 63 cards   4 1  Set Rule  The game may be played with a standard variation known as setting  An opponent is set when they fail to fulfill a contract by a predetermined number of bids  The point system and scoring remain as per standard  but an opponent who is awarded the kitty and is subsequently set is not allowed to bid in the next round  Note that it is only the player awarded the kitty  not all players on the team  that is not allowed to bid in the next round  In the case of a set occurring during double misère the player who touches the kitty first is not allowed to bid in the next round   Typically  the set occurs at one trick more than is actually necessary to break the bidding team’s contract  In other words  5 tricks in a 7 trick bid  4 tricks in an 8 trick bid  3 tricks in a 9 trick bid  2 tricks in a 10 trick bid  However  for misère  open misère  and double misère a set always occurs at 3 tricks   4 2  Breach rule  related to the Set rule   Breach indicates that a non bidding team intends to breach the contract of a bidding team by at least one more trick than is actually necessary to break the contract  As opposed to the Setting rule  Breach must be called on a per hand basis  and does result in additional scoring  Typically  Breach is not played in a game when the setting rule is being used   A single player from a non bidding partnership may call to breach another team’s contract after a successful bid for a seven trick  or more  contract has been made  The breach call may be made before or after the contracting team picks up the kitty  but must be made before game play starts  Typically  a breach occurs at one trick more than is actually necessary to break the bidding team’s contract  In other words  5 tricks in a 7 trick bid  4 tricks in an 8 trick bid  3 tricks in a 9 trick bid  2 tricks in a 10 trick bid  However  for misère  open misère  and double misère a breach always occurs at 3 tricks   A breach call can result in three different scenarios    Win Lose  If the bidding team successfully fulfills its contract  then it receives the full points of the original bid  and the team calling breach loses points    Lose Lose  If the bidding team does not fulfill its bid  but the opposing team does not take the necessary number of tricks to perform a breach  then the bidding team loses the point value of the original bid  and the team calling breach loses the predetermined value of the breach call    Lose Win  If the bidding team loses its bid by the pre established number of tricks  then the bidding team loses the contract points  and the team calling breach gains the predetermined value of the breach call   Because breach is not considered an actual bid  a team may not win or lose  “go out the back door”  based on points gained or lost from a breach call   A player who calls breach but does not fulfill the conditions of breach  win lose or lose lose scenario  is not allowed to bid in the next round  A player who bids a seven trick contract but is successfully breached by an opponent  lose win scenario  is not allowed to bid in the next round   4 3  Point Spread rule  A variation on the score keeping  the point spread rule ends the game when one team has a negative score and the other team has a positive score  which results in a point spread of 500 or more points   5  Versions  5 1  Two handed 500  Two handed 500 is played with a deck of 45 cards as per the standard game  Whereas in the standard game which includes partners  in the Two handed game each player plays both the hand that is dealt to them and their partner’s which is dealt to the table  The deal is the same as the standard game  except that the partners hands are dealt to the table so that they have 5 cards face down  each covered by a face up card  to give a total of 10 cards   Bidding is the same as the standard game except Misère is generally not allowed  The kitty is used with the player’s hand only and no cards can be swapped between the hands  Order of play is as per the standard game  After each trick any exposed face down cards from the partner’s hands are turned up and revealed  Play then continues with the lead from the hand that won the last trick   Alternatively  the game can be played as per three handed but with a  dead hand    An alternate version is played with the standard 52 card deck  Each player is dealt ten cards and then 8 more cards are exposed on the table  Each player chooses one of these cards to be added to the kitty  No dummies are used and the bidding is standard  After the bid is won the defending player adds one of the remaining exposed cards to his hand and discards an unwanted card  The remaining exposed cards are added to the dead card pile   5 2  Three handed 500  Three handed 500 is played with a deck of 33 cards  Dealing  scoring and game play are as for the standard game  The common variant is in bidding  where misère may be bid before a bid for seven tricks  This variant is permitted due to the relative rarity of seven trick bids outside of team play  Open misère may be bid in a similar fashion  Alternatively  the game may be played with the standard deck  45 or 43 cards  with one hand dealt face down  which remains untouched during the game  a so called  dead hand    The common strategy is that the two players who are unsuccessful in bidding form a temporary alliance in an attempt to force the other player to lose his bid   5 3  Five handed 500  Another variation allows five players to play  All of the cards in a deck are used  although only one joker  so that each player can be dealt ten cards  The bidding starts to the dealer s left  and works by the same system as normal 500  The player who wins the bidding then gets to choose a card  the joker cannot be chosen   One of the bowers is usually chosen  or another high card  There are two versions of this variation  In one  the player who owns the chosen card announces that they have it  and then becomes the bidder s partner for that round  In the other  the player winning the bidding will not know who their partner is until the chosen card is played  Note that the partnership will usually change for each round  The remaining three players then play against the partnership  The player who won the bid gets to play the first card   Scoring for this variation uses the same values as normal 500  If the partnership wins the required amount of tricks  they will both get points  full points each or half points each  depending on the variation   and if they don t  they will both lose points  either full or half   If one of the three remaining players wins a trick  that player will receive ten points  Neither misère nor open misère is usually permitted in this variant since it is too easy to win  Because the partnership changes each round  there are no fixed teams and each player plays for themselves  This adds dynamic  and new strategies will arise   5 4  Six handed 500  Special decks of cards exist for playing six handed 500  using a total of 65 cards  Besides using all 52 cards of the standard poker deck  plus one joker  these sets include 11 s  12 s  and 13 s of all four suits  Each player receives 10 cards  and the kitty receives 5  Players seated in alternating positions around the table form two teams of three players each   Queen s Slipper s 500 pack does not have black 13 s  usually 6 handed is played with 63 cards and 3 in kitty    5 5  No Trump 500  In some versions  no trump games  including misère   the only trump card is the joker  i e  the best card  and it has no suit  There are no bowers and all the jacks fall between the queen and ten of their respective suits  Players must always follow suit and may use the joker to trump a trick only if they cannot otherwise follow suit  A player may not  renege  with the joker   i e   use it as a card of a suit in which the player has already claimed to be void  In some variations  the joker may only be played as the first or last card in a suit   In other variations  the person who wins the bid also has the option to  Declare   Such a declaration entitles the winner of the bid to receive one card from his partner after discarding from the kitty or blind  The partner picks his best card and hands it face down to the winning bidder  who must then discard one additional card to retain a ten card hand  The winning bidder now plays against the opponents without the assistance of the partner and must take all ten tricks  If such a bid is unsuccessful it is scored as  500  negative 500    5 6  Walker Ultimate 500  A variation in which the winning team player must win exactly 500 points  The game is played as normal  with the additional rule that 1000 points  like negative 500 points  loses the game   Peggings   or  Scab Points   must be played  This variation usually  not always  results in a longer game  but generates an enjoyable level of complexity to both the bidding and playing   Local variants may not include either open misère  misère or both   5 7  French Canadian Variation  A variation for four players using two Jokers   bonhommes   and a standard 52 card pack stripped of 2s and 3s  The white Joker   la blanche   is considered stronger  The players are dealt 10 cards each in batches of 3 3 4  When 3 are passed  another 3 go to the kitty   chatte   middle of the table   There should be 6 cards in the middle after the deal  Some variations allow for the final card placed in the kitty to be turned upright for all players to see   The attacking player takes the kitty and discards 6 cards of his choice  and no other player may see them  The bidding goes accordingly with the other variation  and Misère   Nulot   may be allowed  The  petite  misère is equal to 500 points and can only be outbid by 8 no trump while  la grosse  or open misère is worth 1000 points and can only be outbid by 10 no trump  the latter is distinguished in that all cards are placed face up on the table    The game is played to a total of 1000 points  If a team fails to fulfil its contract  the points are added to the other team s total  Points are never subtracted   6  Score keeping  The goal is for the team who wins the bid to take at least as many tricks as they bid  If the high bid is  eight hearts   then the team wins the hand if they take 8  9  or all 10 tricks and are awarded points according to the table below  There are no bonuses for overtricks  tricks over the number bid   If they do not make their bid  the same number of points is subtracted from their score  Whether or not the bid winning team achieves its bid  the opposing team receives 10 points for each trick they take  A team wins the game by scoring at least 500 points  A team whose score dips to  500 points or below loses the game  This is also known as going  out the back door  or  out backwards    The following table is the most commonly used  Avondale  Scoring for bids   Original Scoring  Variations in score keeping  6 trick bids are considered inkles  raising the minimum bid to 7 Spades   If a team bids 8 Spades or less  but takes all 10 tricks  they can receive 250 points  known as a  slam    A team wins the game by scoring at least 500 points through winning bids  which means that any team surpassing 500 points solely with tricks has not yet won the game   The game can be played with the removal of the trick points  thus only winning bids score points   If both teams pass 500 points on the same hand  the bidding team wins even if they have fewer points   A team whose score dips below  500 points loses the game only if the other team is not in the negative   In an unrestricted bidding game  there are no limitations on which hands can be called when  such as only allowing a Misere call after a bid of 7 has already been made  Instead  each subsequent player need only be able to outbid the current highest bid  or pass    Split the colors In this scoring variation Misere outbids 7 black  but not 7 red  Open Misere outbids 8 black  but not 8 red  Hi Lo outbids 9 black  but not 9 red  and Double Misere outbids 10 black  but not 10 red  shown in table below    Perfect variant  Scoring for each family of tricks is reduced by 20 points  see table below   causing 10 No Trump  the highest bid  to be worth exactly 500 points   According to the rules supplied with most Australian 500 specific playing card decks  6 Spades is scored as 40 points  6 Clubs as 60 points  increasing by 20 points each bid in this fashion to 120 points for 6 No Trump all the way through to 520 points for 10 No Trump  However  Open Misère  also scoring 520 points  is ranked as the highest bid  Additionally  Misère is deemed to outrank a 7 bid but not an 8 bid   7  Strategy  7 1  Bidding  Bids are typically made with the consideration that you will be receiving cards from the kitty and playing with a partner  except for misère and open misère  who hopefully will also be able to win a certain amount of tricks  While the number of tricks you feel your partner will be able to win will vary in each situation  you should bid based on that assumption and not only on the cards in your hand   On the other hand  it is also important to remember that your partner will be using the same strategy in their bidding  and therefore  if your partner bids six hearts  for example  you may not necessarily want to bid eight hearts simply because you have two cards of the proposed trump suit in your hand   When confronted with a hand that is more or less even in two different suits  it is customary to bid on the suit with a higher point value   7 2  Card Counting  When playing with 45 cards  the deck is composed of four suits with 11 cards each  and one Joker  In a suited contract  e g   seven hearts  eight spades  etc    the trump suit will have 13 cards  the suit of the same color will have only ten  and the two suits of opposite color will remain at 11 cards each   A simple strategy to bidding is to attempt to predict how the unaccounted for trump cards  the ones you don’t actually hold in your hand  would be distributed among the remaining players  excluding the kitty  with all things being equal  In other words  if you hold seven cards of one suit it can be helpful to assume that the remaining six trump cards are distributed evenly among the remaining three players  two each and none in the kitty   Doing so can provide a basic idea of how many times your opponents will be able to follow suit in each of the four suits   7 3  Discarding the kitty  If you are successful at bidding a suited contract and are awarded the kitty  a basic strategy of discarding is to eliminate as many non trump suits from your hand as possible  thus giving the most opportunity to use trump cards  However  discarding as many suits as possible is only a basic strategy  and should be met with some qualifications   First  in most contract bids it is beneficial to keep an ace of any non trump suit  as with all things being equal each player should have at least two cards of any given suit  thus the ace of any non trump suit should theoretically be a winning card   Second  it can also be effective in some circumstances to intentionally keep the king of a non trump suit and a low card of the same suit  for example the six and king of hearts when spades are trump  when you are unable to discard that suit entirely  The resulting strategy is to then play the low card first  with the assumption that you will lose the trick to the player holding the ace of that suit  and then when you have regained control of the table the king is played under the assumption that it will be a winning card   8  Playing the cards  The way in which cards should be led will always be situational  and is subject to variations in the rules described in the Rules section   8 1  Leading trump  Sometimes called flushing or bleeding trump  leading the trump suit immediately can often be  but isn’t always  an effective strategy  This is typically done in the following situations   First  when a player has an above average number of high trump cards they may wish to flush out the missing high trump cards  For example  if a player who has bid seven hearts is left holding the Joker  jack of diamonds  ace of hearts  king of hearts  queen of hearts and four of hearts  then they have five of the six highest cards  and six total   A suitable strategy would be to start the game playing highest trump  the Joker  in an attempt to force the play of the jack of hearts   An alternate  but similar  strategy in this situation would be to play the queen of hearts  This alternate strategy would force the player holding the jack of hearts to decide between either playing the jack  or throwing away a lower trump card to intentionally lose to the queen   9  See also  Oh Hell   500 Version
