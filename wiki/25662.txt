Captain Robert Falcon Scott  CVO  RN  6 June 1868 – 29 March 1912  was a British Royal Navy officer and explorer who led two expeditions to the Antarctic regions  the Discovery Expedition  1901–04  and the ill fated Terra Nova Expedition  1910–13  On the first expedition  he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82°S and discovered the Polar Plateau  on which the South Pole is located  During the second venture  Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912  only to find that they had been preceded by Roald Amundsen s Norwegian expedition  On their return journey  Scott s party discovered plant fossils  proving Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents  At a distance of 150 miles from their base camp and 11 miles from the next depot  Scott and his companions died from a combination of exhaustion  starvation and extreme cold   Before his appointment to lead the Discovery Expedition  Scott had followed the conventional career of a naval officer in peacetime Victorian Britain  In 1899  he had a chance encounter with Sir Clements Markham  the president of the Royal Geographical Society  and learned for the first time of a planned Antarctic expedition  A few days later  on 11 June  Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition  Having taken this step  his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic  the field of work to which he remained committed during the final twelve years of his life   Following the news of his death  Scott became an iconic British hero  a status reflected by the many permanent memorials erected across the nation  In the closing decades of the 20th century  the legend was reassessed as attention focused on the causes of the disaster that ended his and his comrades  lives  From a previously unassailable position  Scott became a figure of controversy  with questions raised about his competence and character  Commentators in the 21st century have on the whole regarded Scott more positively  emphasising his personal bravery and stoicism while acknowledging his errors and  more recently  errors by his team members  but ascribing the expedition s fate primarily to misfortune   1  Early life  1 1  Family  Scott was born on 6 June 1868  the third child out of six and elder son of John Edward and Hannah  née Cuming  Scott of Stoke Damerel  near Devonport  Devon  Although Scott s father was a brewer and magistrate  there were naval and military traditions in the family  Scott s grandfather and four uncles all having served in the army or navy  John Scott s prosperity came from the ownership of a small Plymouth brewery which he inherited from his father and subsequently sold  In later years  when Scott was establishing his naval career  the family would suffer serious financial misfortune  but his early childhood years were spent in comfort   In accordance with the family s tradition  Robert and his younger brother Archie were predestined for careers in the armed services  Robert spent four years at a local day school before being sent to Stubbington House School  Stubbington  Hampshire  a cramming establishment preparing candidates for the entrance examinations to the naval training ship HMS Britannia at Dartmouth  Having passed these exams Scott  aged 13  began his naval career in 1881  as a cadet   1 2  Early naval career  In July 1883  Scott passed out of Britannia as a midshipman  seventh overall in a class of 26  By October  he was en route to South Africa to join   the flagship of the Cape squadron  the first of several ships on which he served during his midshipman years  While stationed in St Kitts  West Indies  on   he had his first encounter with Clements Markham  then Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society  RGS   who would loom large in Scott s later career  On this occasion  1 March 1887  Markham observed Midshipman Scott s cutter winning that morning s race across the bay  Markham s habit was to  collect  likely young naval officers with a view to their undertaking polar exploration work in the future  He was impressed by Scott s intelligence  enthusiasm and charm  and the 18 year old midshipman was duly noted   In March 1888 Scott passed his examinations for sub lieutenant  with four first class certificates out of five  His career progressed smoothly  with service on various ships and promotion to lieutenant in 1889  In 1891  after a long spell in foreign waters  he applied for the two year torpedo training course on   an important career step  He graduated with first class certificates in both the theory and practical examinations  A small blot occurred in the summer of 1893 when  while commanding a torpedo boat  Scott ran it aground  a mishap which earned him a mild rebuke   During the research for his dual biography of Scott and Roald Amundsen  polar historian Roland Huntford investigated a possible scandal in Scott s early naval career  related to the period 1889–90 when Scott was a lieutenant on   According to Huntford  Scott  disappears from naval records  for eight months  from mid August 1889 until 26 March 1890  Huntford hints at involvement with a married American woman  of cover up  and protection by senior officers  Biographer David Crane reduces the missing period to eleven weeks  but is unable to clarify further  He rejects the notion of protection by senior officers on the grounds that Scott was not important or well connected enough to warrant this  Documents that may have offered explanations are missing from Admiralty records   In 1894  while serving as torpedo officer on the depot ship   Scott learned of the financial calamity that had overtaken his family  John Scott  having sold the brewery and invested the proceeds unwisely  had lost all his capital and was now virtually bankrupt  At the age of 63  and in poor health  he was forced to take a job as a brewery manager and move his family to Shepton Mallet  Somerset  Three years later  while Robert was serving with the Channel squadron flagship   John Scott died of heart disease  creating a fresh family crisis  Hannah Scott and her two unmarried daughters now relied entirely on the service pay of Scott and the salary of younger brother Archie  who had left the army for a higher paid post in the colonial service  Archie s own death in the autumn of 1898  after contracting typhoid fever  meant that the whole financial responsibility for the family rested on Scott   Promotion  and the extra income this would bring  now became a matter of considerable concern to Scott  In the Royal Navy however  opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers  Early in June 1899  while home on leave  he had a chance encounter in a London street with Clements Markham  who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society  RGS   and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with the Discovery  under the auspices of the RGS  It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself  rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott  according to Crane  What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded  but a few days later  on 11 June  Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition   2  Discovery Expedition 1901–1904  The British National Antarctic Expedition  later known as the Discovery Expedition  was a joint enterprise of the RGS and the Royal Society  A long cherished dream of Markham s  it required all of his skills and cunning to bring the expedition to fruition  under naval command and largely staffed by naval personnel  Scott may not have been Markham s first choice as leader but  having decided on him  the older man s support remained constant  There were committee battles over the scope of Scott s responsibilities  with the Royal Society pressing to put a scientist in charge of the expedition s programme while Scott merely commanded the ship  Eventually  however  Markham s view prevailed  Scott was given overall command  and was promoted to the rank of commander before Discovery sailed for the Antarctic on 6 August 1901  King Edward VII  who showed a keen interest in the expedition  visited the Discovery the day before the ship left British shores in August 1901  and during the visit appointed Scott a Member of the Royal Victorian Order  MVO   his personal gift   Experience of Antarctic or Arctic waters was almost entirely lacking within the 50 strong party and there was very little special training in equipment or techniques before the ship set sail  Dogs were taken  as were skis  but hardly anyone knew how to use them  In Markham s view  professionalism was considered less praiseworthy than  unforced aptitude   and possibly Scott was influenced by Markham s belief  In the first of the two full years which Discovery spent in the ice  this insouciance was severely tested  as the expedition struggled to meet the challenges of the unfamiliar terrain  During an early attempt at ice travel  a blizzard trapped expedition members in their tent and their decision to leave it resulted in the death of George Vince  who slipped over a precipice on 11 March 1902   The expedition had both scientific and exploration objectives  the latter included a long journey south  in the direction of the South Pole  This march  undertaken by Scott  Ernest Shackleton and Edward Wilson  took them to a latitude of 82° 17′ S  about from the pole  A harrowing return journey brought about Shackleton s physical collapse and his early departure from the expedition  The second year showed improvements in technique and achievement  culminating in Scott s western journey which led to the discovery of the Polar Plateau  This has been described by one writer as  one of the great polar journeys   The scientific results of the expedition included important biological  zoological and geological findings  Some of the meteorological and magnetic readings  however  were later criticised as amateurish and inaccurate   At the end of the expedition it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free Discovery from the ice  Afterwards  Scott remained unconvinced that dogs and ski were the keys to efficient ice travel  In the following years he continued to express the British preference for man hauling  the practice of propelling sledges by manpower  unassisted by animals   a view he maintained until very late in his Antarctic career  His insistence during the expedition on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent  many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903  Second in command Albert Armitage  a merchant officer  was offered the chance to go home on compassionate grounds  but chose to interpret the offer as a personal slight  and refused  Armitage also promoted the idea that the decision to send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott s animosity rather than Shackleton s physical breakdown  Although there were later tensions between Scott and Shackleton  when their polar ambitions directly clashed  in public mutual civilities were preserved  Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the Nimrod Expedition  and the two were exchanging polite letters about their respective ambitions in 1909–10   3  Between expeditions  3 1  Popular hero  Discovery returned to Britain in September 1904  The expedition had caught the public imagination  and Scott became a popular hero  He was awarded a cluster of honours and medals  including many from overseas  and was promoted to the rank of captain  He was invited to Balmoral Castle  where King Edward VII promoted him a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order  CVO    Scott s next few years were crowded  For more than a year he was occupied with public receptions  lectures and the writing of the expedition record  The Voyage of the Discovery  In January 1906  he resumed his full time naval career  first as an Assistant Director of Naval Intelligence at the Admiralty and  in August  as flag captain to Rear Admiral Sir George Egerton on   He was now moving in ever more exalted social circles — a telegram to Markham in February 1907 refers to meetings with the Queen and Crown Prince of Portugal  and a later letter home reports lunching with the Commander in Chief of the Fleet and Prince Heinrich of Prussia   3 2  Dispute with Shackleton  By early 1906  Scott had sounded out the RGS about the possible funding of a future Antarctic expedition  It was therefore unwelcome news to him that Ernest Shackleton had announced his own plans to travel to Discoverys old McMurdo Sound base and launch a bid for the South Pole from there  Scott claimed  in the first of a series of letters to Shackleton  that the area around McMurdo was his own  field of work  to which he had prior rights until he chose to give them up  and that Shackleton should therefore work from an entirely different area  In this  he was strongly supported by Discoverys former zoologist  Edward Wilson  who asserted that Scott s rights extended to the entire Ross Sea sector  This Shackleton refused to concede  Finally  to end the impasse  Shackleton agreed  in a letter to Scott dated 17 May 1907  to work to the east of the 170° W meridian and therefore to avoid all the familiar Discovery ground  In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless  With his only other option being to return home  he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds  close to the old Discovery base  For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time  Among modern polar writers  Ranulph Fiennes regards Shackleton s actions as a technical breach of honour  but adds   My personal belief is that Shackleton was basically honest but circumstances forced his McMurdo landing  much to his distress   The polar historian Beau Riffenburgh states that the promise to Scott  should never ethically have been demanded   and compares Scott s intransigence on this matter unfavourably with the generous attitudes of the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen  who gave freely of his advice and expertise to all  whether they were potential rivals or not   3 3  Marriage  Scott  who because of his Discovery fame had entered Edwardian society  first met Kathleen Bruce early in 1907 at a private luncheon party  She was a sculptress  socialite and cosmopolitan who had studied under Auguste Rodin and whose circle included Isadora Duncan  Pablo Picasso and Aleister Crowley  Her initial meeting with Scott was brief  but when they met again later that year  the mutual attraction was obvious  A stormy courtship followed  Scott was not her only suitor—his main rival was would be novelist Gilbert Cannan—and his absences at sea did not assist his cause  However  Scott s persistence was rewarded and  on 2 September 1908  at the Chapel Royal  Hampton Court Palace  the wedding took place  Their only child  Peter Markham Scott  was born on 14 September 1909   By this time  Scott had announced his plans for his second Antarctic expedition  Shackleton had returned  having narrowly failed to reach the Pole  and this gave Scott the impetus to proceed  On 24 March 1909  he had taken the Admiralty based appointment of naval assistant to the Second Sea Lord which placed him conveniently in London  In December he was released on half pay  to take up the full time command of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910  to be known as the Terra Nova Expedition from its ship  Terra Nova   4  Terra Nova Expedition 1910–1912    File Antarctic expedition map  Amundsen

be  scientific primarily  with exploration and the Pole as secondary objects  but  unlike the Discovery Expedition  neither they nor the Royal Society were in charge this time  In his expedition prospectus  Scott stated that its main objective was  to reach the South Pole  and to secure for the British Empire the honour of this achievement   Scott had  as Markham observed  been  bitten by the Pole mania    In a memorandum of 1908  Scott presented his view that man hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed  Snow vehicles did not yet exist however  and so his engineer Reginald Skelton developed the idea of a caterpillar track for snow surfaces  In the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get him all the way to the Pole  and decided additionally to take horses  based on Shackleton s near success in attaining the Pole  using ponies   and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910  Man hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau  on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed Beardmore Glacier  Dog expert Cecil Meares was going to Siberia to select the dogs  and Scott ordered that  while he was there  he should deal with the purchase of Manchurian ponies  Meares was not an experienced horse dealer  and the ponies he chose proved mostly of poor quality  and ill suited to prolonged Antarctic work  Meanwhile  Scott also recruited Bernard Day  from Shackleton s expedition  as his motor expert   4 2  First season  On 15 June 1910  Scott s ship Terra Nova  an old converted whaler  set sail from Cardiff  Wales  Scott meanwhile was fundraising in Britain and joined the ship later in South Africa  Arriving in Melbourne  Australia in October 1910  Scott received a telegram from Amundsen stating   Beg leave to inform you Fram proceeding Antarctic Amundsen   possibly indicating that Scott faced a race to the pole  The expedition suffered a series of early misfortunes  which hampered the first season s work and impaired preparations for the main polar march  On its journey from New Zealand to the Antarctic  Terra Nova nearly sank in a storm and was then trapped in pack ice for 20 days  far longer than other ships had experienced  which meant a late season arrival and less time for preparatory work before the Antarctic winter  At Cape Evans  Antarctica  one of the motor sledges was lost during its unloading from the ship  breaking through the sea ice and sinking  Deteriorating weather conditions and weak  unacclimatised ponies affected the initial depot laying journey  so that the expedition s main supply point  One Ton Depot  was laid north of its planned location at 80° S  Lawrence Oates  in charge of the ponies  advised Scott to kill ponies for food and advance the depot to 80° S  which Scott refused to do  Oates is reported as saying to Scott   Sir  I m afraid you ll come to regret not taking my advice   Four ponies died during this journey either from the cold or because they slowed the team down so they were shot   On its return to base  the expedition learned of the presence of Amundsen  camped with his crew and a large contingent of dogs in the Bay of Whales  200 miles  320 km  to their east  Scott conceded that his ponies would not be able to start early enough in the season to compete with Amundsen s cold tolerant dog teams for the pole  and also acknowledged that the Norwegian s base was closer to the pole by 60 miles  Wilson was more hopeful  whereas Gran shared Scott s concern  Shortly afterwards  the death toll among the ponies increased to six  two drowning when sea ice unexpectedly disintegrated  casting in doubt the possibility of reaching the pole at all  However  during the 1911 winter Scott s confidence increased  on 2 August  after the return of a three man party from their winter journey to Cape Crozier  Scott wrote   I feel sure we are as near perfection as experience can direct    4 3  Journey to the Pole  Scott outlined his plans for the southern journey to the entire shore party  but left open who would form the final polar team  Eleven days before Scott s teams set off towards the pole  Scott gave the dog driver Meares the following written orders at Cape Evans dated 20 October 1911 to secure Scott s speedy return from the pole using dogs   The march south began on 1 November 1911  a caravan of mixed transport groups  motors  dogs  horses   with loaded sledges  travelling at different rates  all designed to support a final group of four men who would make a dash for the Pole  The southbound party steadily reduced in size as successive support teams turned back  Scott reminded the returning Atkinson of the order  to take the two dog teams south in the event of Meares having to return home  as seemed likely   By 4 January 1912  the last two four man groups had reached 87° 34′ S  Scott announced his decision  five men  Scott  Edward Wilson  Henry Bowers  Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans  would go forward  the other three  Teddy Evans  William Lashly and Tom Crean  would return  The chosen group marched on  reaching the Pole on 17 January 1912  only to find that Amundsen had preceded them by five weeks  Scott s anguish is indicated in his diary   The worst has happened    All the day dreams must go    Great God  This is an awful place    4 4  Last march  The deflated party began the return journey on 19 January   I m afraid the return journey is going to be dreadfully tiring and monotonous   wrote Scott on that day  However  the party made good progress despite poor weather  and had completed the Polar Plateau stage of their journey  approximately 300 miles  500 km   by 7 February  In the following days  as the party made the descent of the Beardmore Glacier  the physical condition of Edgar Evans  which Scott had noted with concern as early as 23 January  declined sharply  A fall on 4 February had left Evans  dull and incapable   and on 17 February  after another fall  he died near the glacier foot   Meanwhile back at Cape Evans  the Terra Nova arrived at the beginning of February  and Atkinson decided to unload the supplies from the ship with his own men rather than set out south with the dogs to meet Scott as ordered  When Atkinson finally did leave south for the planned rendezvous with Scott  he encountered the scurvy ridden Edward   Teddy   Evans who needed his urgent medical attention  Atkinson therefore tried to send the experienced navigator Wright south to meet Scott  but chief meteorologist Simpson declared he needed Wright for scientific work  Atkinson then decided to send the short sighted Cherry Garrard on 25 February  who was not able to navigate  only as far as One Ton depot  which is within sight of Mount Erebus   effectively cancelling Scott s orders for meeting him at latitude 82 or 82 30 on 1 March   On the return journey from the Pole  Scott reached the 82 30°S meeting point for the dog teams  three days ahead of schedule  noting in his diary for 27 February 1912  We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs  where and when  etc  It is a critical position  We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot  but there is a horrid element of doubt   By March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming   The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed  Meares  the dog driver  had a bad trip home I suppose  It s a miserable jumble   With 400 miles  670 km  still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf  Scott s party s prospects steadily worsened as  with deteriorating weather  frostbite  snow blindness  hunger and exhaustion  they struggled northward  In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer  dated March 16  Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams   We very nearly came through  and it s a pity to have missed it  but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark  No one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support   On the same day  Oates  whose toes had become frostbitten  voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death  Scott wrote that Oates  last words were  I am just going outside and may be some time    After walking a farther 20 miles despite Scott s toes now becoming frostbitten  the three remaining men made their final camp on 19 March  short of One Ton Depot  The next day a fierce blizzard prevented their making any progress  During the next nine days  as their supplies ran out  and with storms still raging outside the tent  Scott and his companions wrote their farewell letters  Scott gave up his diary after 23 March  save for a final entry on 29 March  with its concluding words   Last entry  For God s sake look after our people   He left letters to Wilson s mother  Bowers  mother  a string of notables including his former commander Sir George Egerton  his own mother and his wife  He also wrote his  Message To The Public   primarily a defence of the expedition s organisation and conduct in which the party s failure is attributed to weather and other misfortunes  but ending on an inspirational note  with these words   Scott is presumed to have died on 29 March 1912  or possibly one day later  The positions of the bodies in the tent when it was discovered eight months later suggested that Scott was the last of the three to die   The bodies of Scott and his companions were discovered by a search party on 12 November 1912 and their records retrieved  Their final camp became their tomb  a high cairn of snow was erected over it  topped by a roughly fashioned cross  In January 1913  before Terra Nova left for home  a large wooden cross was made by the ship s carpenters  inscribed with the names of the lost party and Tennyson s line from his poem Ulysses   To strive  to seek  to find  and not to yield   and was erected as a permanent memorial on Observation Hill  overlooking Hut Point   A century of storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent  which are now encased in the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea  In 2001 glaciologist Charles R  Bentley estimated that the tent with the bodies was under about 75 feet  23 m  of ice and about 30 miles  48 km  from the point where they died  he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea  and perhaps float away inside an iceberg   5  Reputation  5 1  Glorification  The world was informed of the tragedy when Terra Nova reached Oamaru  New Zealand  on 10 February 1913  Within days  Scott became a national icon  A fierce nationalistic spirit was aroused  the London Evening News called for the story to be read to schoolchildren throughout the land  to coincide with the memorial service at St Paul s Cathedral on 14 February  Robert Baden Powell  founder of the Boy Scouts Association  asked   Are Britons going downhill  No      There is plenty of pluck and spirit left in the British after all  Captain Scott and Captain Oates have shown us that   Eleven year old Mary Steel wrote a poem which ended   The survivors of the expedition were suitably honoured on their return  with polar medals and promotions for the naval personnel  In place of the knighthood that might have been her husband s had he survived  Kathleen Scott was granted the rank and precedence of a widow of a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath  In 1922  she married Edward Hilton Young  later Lord Kennet  she becoming Lady Kennet   and remained a doughty defender of Scott s reputation until her death  aged 69  in 1947   An article in The Times  reporting on the glowing tributes paid to Scott in the New York press  claimed that both Amundsen and Shackleton were   amazed  to hear that such a disaster could overtake a well organized expedition   On learning the details of Scott s death  Amundsen is reported as saying   I would gladly forgo any honour or money if thereby I could have saved Scott his terrible death   Scott was much the better wordsmith of the two  and the story that spread throughout the world was largely that told by him  with Amundsen s victory reduced in the eyes of many to an unsporting stratagem  Even before Scott s death was known  Amundsen had been offended by what he felt was a  sneering toast   from RGS President Lord Curzon  at a meeting held supposedly to honour the polar victor  Curzon had called for  three cheers for the dogs   According to Huntford s account  this slight caused Amundsen to resign his honorary RGS fellowship   The response to Scott s final plea on behalf of the dependents of the dead was enormous by the standards of the day  The Mansion House Scott Memorial Fund closed at £75 000  2009 approximation £5 5 million   This was not equally distributed  Scott s widow  son  mother and sisters received a total of £18 000  £1 3 million   Wilson s widow got £8 500  £600 000  and Bowers s mother £4 500  £330 000   Edgar Evans s widow  children and mother received £1 500  £109 000  between them   In the dozen years following the disaster  more than 30 monuments and memorials were set up in Britain alone  These ranged from simple relics  Scott s sledging flag in Exeter Cathedral  to the foundation of the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge  Many more were established in other parts of the world  including a statue crafted by his widow for his New Zealand base in Christchurch   5 2  Modern reaction  Scott s reputation survived the period after World War II  beyond the 50th anniversary of his death  In 1948  the film Scott of the Antarctic was released in cinemas and was the third most popular film in Britain the following year  It portrays the team spirit of the expedition and the harsh Antarctic environment  but also includes critical scenes such as Scott regarding his broken down motors and ruefully remembering Nansen s advice to take only dogs  Evans and Cherry Garrard were the only surviving expedition members to refuse participation in the film  but both re published their respective books in its wake  In 1966  Reginald Pound  the first biographer given access to Scott s original sledging journal  revealed personal failings which cast a new light on Scott  although Pound continued to endorse his heroism  writing of  a splendid sanity that would not be subdued   Within the following decade  further books appeared  each of which to some degree challenged the prevailing public perception  The most critical of these was David Thomson s Scott s Men  1977   in Thomson s view  Scott was not a great man   at least  not until near the end   his planning is described as  haphazard  and  flawed   his leadership characterised by lack of foresight  Thus by the late 1970s  in Jones s words   Scott s complex personality had been revealed and his methods questioned    In 1979 came the most sustained attack on Scott  from Roland Huntford s dual biography Scott and Amundsen in which Scott is depicted as a  heroic bungler   Huntford s thesis had an immediate impact  becoming the new orthodoxy  Even Scott s heroism in the face of death is challenged  Huntford sees Scott s Message to the Public as a deceitful self justification from a man who had led his comrades to their deaths  After Huntford s book  debunking Captain Scott became commonplace  Francis Spufford  in a 1996 history not wholly antagonistic to Scott  refers to  devastating evidence of bungling   concluding that  Scott doomed his companions  then covered his tracks with rhetoric   Travel writer Paul Theroux summarised Scott as  confused and demoralised     an enigma to his men  unprepared and a bungler   This decline in Scott s reputation was accompanied by a corresponding rise in that of his erstwhile rival Shackleton  at first in the United States but eventually in Britain as well  A 2002 nationwide poll in the United Kingdom to discover the  100 Greatest Britons  showed Shackleton in eleventh place  Scott well down the list at 54th   The early years of the 21st century have seen a shift of opinion in Scott s favour  in what cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski calls  a revision of the revisionist view   Meteorologist Susan Solomon s 2001 account The Coldest March ties the fate of Scott s party to the extraordinarily adverse Barrier weather conditions of February and March 1912 rather than to personal or organizational failings  although Solomon accepts the validity of some of the criticisms of Scott  In 2004 polar explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes published a biography which was a strong defence of Scott and an equally forthright rebuttal of Huntford  the book is dedicated  To the Families of the Defamed Dead   Fiennes was later criticised by the reviewer of another book for the personal nature of his attacks on Huntford  and for his apparent assumption that his own experiences as a polar explorer gave him unique authority   In 2005 David Crane published a new Scott biography which  according to Barczewski  goes some way towards an assessment of Scott  free from the baggage of earlier interpretations   What has happened to Scott s reputation  Crane argues  derives from the way the world has changed since the heroic myth was formed   It is not that we see him differently from the way they  his contemporaries  did  but that we see him the same  and instinctively do not like it   Crane s main achievement  according to Barczewski  is the restoration of Scott s humanity   far more effectively than either Fiennes s stridency or Solomon s scientific data   Daily Telegraph columnist Jasper Rees  likening the changes in explorers  reputations to climatic variations  suggests that  in the current Antarctic weather report  Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty five years   The New York Times Book Review was more critical  pointing out Crane s support for Scott s discredited claims regarding the circumstances of the freeing of the Discovery from the pack ice  and concluded  For all the many attractions of his book  David Crane offers no answers that convincingly exonerate Scott from a significant share of responsibility for his own demise    In 2012  Karen May published her discovery that Scott had issued written orders  before his march to the Pole  for Meares to meet the returning party with dog teams  in contrast to Huntford s assertion that Scott issued those vital instructions only as a casual oral order to Evans during the march to the Pole  This misrepresentation has given a generation of modern scholars since 1979 the impression that Scott had left his subordinates back at base unsure of his intentions  who would consequently have failed to use the dogs in a concerted attempt to relieve the returning polar party   6  Notes and references  7  Sources  7 1  Books  7 2  Online  8  Further reading  Caesar  Adrian  The White  Last
