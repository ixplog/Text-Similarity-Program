was controlled by the Tahirids followed by the Saffarids  Samanids  Ghaznavids  Ghurids  Ilkhanates  Timurids  and Khanate of Bukhara  According to tradition  the city of Mazari Sharif owes its existence to a dream  At the beginning of the 12th century  a local mullah had a dream in which the 7th century Ali bin Abi Talib  cousin and son in law of Muhammad  appeared to reveal that he had been secretly buried near the city of Balkh  The famous Jalal al Din Rumi was born in this area but like many historical figures his exact location of birth cannot be confirmed  His father Baha  Walad was descended from the first caliph Abu Bakr and was influenced by the ideas of Ahmad Ghazali  brother of the famous philosopher  Baha  Walad s sermons were published and still exist as Divine Sciences  Ma arif   Rumi completed six books of mystical poetry and tales called Masnavi before he died in 1273   After conducting researches in the 12th century  the Seljuk sultan Ahmed Sanjar ordered a city and shrine to be built on the location  where it stood until its destruction by Genghis Khan and his Mongol army in the 13th century  Although later rebuilt  Mazar stood in the shadow of its neighbor Balkh  During the nineteenth century  due to the absence of drainage systems and the weak economy of the region  the excess water of this area flooded many acres of the land in the vicinity of residential areas causing a malaria epidemic in the region  Thus the ruler of North Central Afghanistan decided to shift the capital of the city of Mazar e Sharif   The Mazar i Sharif means the grave of Sharif  This name represents the Blue Mosque which is widely known to be the grave of Hazrat Ali   Muhammad s son in law    The city along with the region south of the Amu Darya became part of the Durrani Empire in around 1750 after a treaty of friendship was reached between Mohammad Murad Beg and Ahmad Shah Durrani  the founding father of Afghanistan  In the late 1870s  Emir Sher Ali Khan ruled the area from his Tashkurgan Palace in Mazar i Sharif  This northern part of Afghanistan was un visited by the British led Indian forces during the Anglo Afghan wars of the 19th century   Mazar i Sharif remained peaceful for the next one hundred years until 1979  when then neighboring Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan  During the 1980s Soviet war  Mazar i Sharif was a strategic base for the Soviet Army as they used its airport to launch air strikes on Afghan mujahideen  After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989  control of Mazar i Sharif was often contested between the Hazara milita Hezbe Wahdat  led by warlord Hajji Mohammed Mohaqiq  the Tajik militia Jamiat e Islami  led by Ahmad Shah Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani  and the Uzbek militia Jumbesh e Melli led by warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum  As a garrison for the Soviet backed Afghan army  the city was under the command of Dostum  who mutinied against Najibullah s government in 1992   Under Dostum s 5 year rule from the early 1990s to early 1997  the city was relatively peaceful  The rest of the nation disintegrated and was slowly taken over by the Taliban forces  Dostum strengthened political ties with the newly independent Uzbekistan as well as Turkey  He printed his own currency and established his own airline  This peace was shattered in May 1997  when he was betrayed by one of his generals  warlord Abdul Malik Pahlawan  forcing him to flee from Mazar i Sharif as the Taliban were getting ready to take the city   1 1  1997 massacre of Taliban prisoners  It is reported that between May and July 1997 Abdul Malik Pahlawan executed thousands of Taliban members  that he personally did many of the killings by slaughtering the prisoners as a revenge for the 1995 death of Abdul Ali Mazari   He is widely believed to have been responsible for the brutal massacre of up to 3 000 Taliban prisoners after inviting them into Mazar i Sharif   Several of the Taliban escaped the slaughtering and reported what had happened   1 2  1998 massacre of Hazara Civilians  In retaliation for this incident  other shocked and furious Taliban came to the city on August 8  1998  and led a six day killing frenzy of Hazaras  An article in The Sunday Times described how  Men  women and children were shot in their homes and on the street  and hospital patients were murdered in their beds   Soon after  the city was surrendered and taken over by the Taliban  It was this capture of Mazar i Sharif  the last major city in Afghanistan to fall to the Taliban  that prompted Pakistan s recognition of the Taliban regime  Soon afterward  the United Arab Emirates  and Saudi Arabia extended official recognition to the regime  while Turkmenistan resumed relations – although the Taliban were not officially recognized by Turkmenbashi as the rulers of Afghanistan   1 3  U S  led military action  Following 9 11  Mazar i Sharif was the first Afghan city to fall to the U S  backed Northern Alliance  United Front   The Taliban s defeat in Mazar quickly turned into a rout from the rest of the north and west of Afghanistan  After the Battle of Mazar i Sharif in November 2001  the city was officially captured by forces of the Northern Alliance  They were joined by the United States Special Operations Forces and supported by U S  Air Force aircraft  As many as 3 000 Taliban fighters who surrendered were reportedly massacred by the Northern Alliance after the battle  and reports also place U S  ground troops at the scene of the massacre  The Irish documentary Afghan Massacre   the Convoy of Death investigated these allegations  Filmmaker Doran claims that mass graves of thousands of victims were found by United Nations investigators  The Bush administration reportedly blocked investigations into the incident   Small scale clashes between militias belonging to different commanders persisted throughout 2002  and were the focus of intensive UN peace brokering and small arms disarmament programme  After some pressure  an office of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission opened an office in Mazar in April 2003  There were also reports about northern Pashtun civilians being ethnic cleansed by the other groups  mainly by ethnic Tajiks  Hazaras and Uzbeks   1 4  NATO presence and the Karzai administration  The city slowly came under the control of the Karzai administration after 2002  which is led by President Hamid Karzai  The 209th Corps  Shaheen  of the Afghan National Army is based at Mazar i Sharif  which provides military assistance to northern Afghanistan  The Afghan Border Police headquarters for the Northern Zone is also located in the city  Despite all the security put in place  there are reports of Taliban activities and assassinations of tribal elders  Officials in Mazar i Sharif reported that between 20 to 30 Afghan tribal elders have been assassinated in Balkh Province in the last several years  There is no conclusive evidence as to who is behind it but majority of the victims are said to have been associated with the Hezb i Islami political party   There are also NATO led peacekeeping forces in and around the city providing assistance to the Afghan government  ISAF Regional Command North  led by Germany  is stationed at Camp Marmal which lies next to Mazar i Sharif Airport  Since 2006  Provincial Reconstruction Team Mazar i Sharif had unit commanders from Sweden  on loan to ISAF  The unit is stationed at Camp Northern Lights  located 10 km west of Camp Marmal  Camp Nidaros

Mission in Afghanistan  UNAMA  were killed by angry demonstrators in the city  see 2011 Mazar i Sharif attack   The demonstration was organized in retaliation to pastors Terry Jones and Wayne Sapp s March 21 Qur an burning in Florida  United States  Among the dead were five Nepalese  a Norwegian  Romanian and Swedish nationals  two of them were said to be decapitated  Terry Jones  the American pastor who was going to burn Islam s Holy Book  denied his responsibility for incitement  President Barack Obama strongly condemned both the Quran burning  calling it an act of  extreme intolerance and bigotry   and the  outrageous  attacks by protesters  referring to them as  an affront to human decency and dignity    No religion tolerates the slaughter and beheading of innocent people  and there is no justification for such a dishonorable and deplorable act   U S  legislators  including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  also condemned both the burning and the violence in reaction to it   By July 2011 violence became at a record high in the insurgency  In late July 2011  NATO troops also handed control of Mazar i Sharif to local forces amid rising security fears just days after it was hit by a deadly bombing  Mazar i Sharif is the sixth of seven areas to transition to Afghan control  but critics say the timing is political and there is skepticism over Afghan abilities to combat the Taliban insurgency   2  Climate  Mazar i Sharif has a cold steppe climate  Köppen climate classification BSk  with hot summers and cold winters  Precipitation is low  and mostly falls between
