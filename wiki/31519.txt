Publication history  1 1  Golden Age  The Flash first appeared in the Golden Age Flash Comics #1  Jan  1940   from All American Publications  one of three companies that would eventually merge to form DC Comics  Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert  this Flash was Jay Garrick  a college student who gained his speed through the inhalation of hard water vapors  When re introduced in the 1960s Garrick s origin was modified slightly  gaining his powers through exposure to heavy water   Jay Garrick was a popular character in the 1940s  supporting both Flash Comics and All Flash Quarterly  later published bi monthly as simply All Flash   co starring in Comic Cavalcade  and being a charter member of the Justice Society of America  the first superhero team  whose adventures ran in All Star Comics  With superheroes  post war decline in popularity  Flash Comics was canceled with issue #104  1949  which featured an Evil version of the Flash called the Rival  The Justice Society s final Golden Age story ran in All Star Comics #57  1951  the title itself continued  as All Star Western    1 2  Silver Age  In 1956  DC Comics successfully revived superheroes  ushering in what became known as the Silver Age of comic books  Rather than bringing back the same Golden Age heroes  DC rethought them as new characters for the modern age  The Flash was the first revival  in the aptly named tryout comic book Showcase #4  Oct  1956    This new Flash was Barry Allen  a police scientist who gained super speed when bathed by chemicals after a shelf of them was struck by lightning  He adopted the name The Flash after reading a comic book featuring the Golden Age Flash  After several more appearances in Showcase  Allen s character was given his own title  The Flash  the first issue of which was #105  resuming where Flash Comics had left off    The Silver Age Flash proved popular enough that several other Golden Age heroes were revived in new incarnations  see  Green Lantern   A new superhero team  the Justice League of America  was also created  with the Flash as a main  charter member   Barry Allen s title also introduced a much imitated plot device into superhero comics when it was revealed that Garrick and Allen existed on fictional parallel worlds  Their powers allowed them to cross the dimensional boundary between worlds  and the men became good friends  Flash of Two Worlds  The Flash  vol  1  #123  was the first crossover in which a Golden Age character met a Silver Age character  Soon  there were crossovers between the entire Justice League and the Justice Society  their respective teams began an annual get together which endured from the early 1960s until the mid 1980s   Allen s adventures continued in his own title until the advent of Crisis on Infinite Earths  The Flash ended as a series with issue #350  Allen s life had become considerably confused in the early 1980s  and DC elected to end his adventures and pass the mantle on to another character  Allen died heroically in Crisis on Infinite Earths #8  1985   Thanks to his ability to travel through time  he would continue to appear occasionally in the years to come   1 3  Modern Age  The third Flash was Wally West  introduced in The Flash  vol  1  #110  Dec  1959  as Kid Flash  West  Allen s nephew by marriage  gained the Flash s powers through an accident identical to Allen s  Adopting the identity of Kid Flash  he maintained membership in the Teen Titans for years  Following Allen s death  West adopted the Flash identity in Crisis on Infinite Earths #12 and was given his own series  beginning with The Flash  vol  2  #1 in 1987  Many issues began with the catchphrase   My name is Wally West  I m the fastest man alive    Due to the Infinite Crisis miniseries and the  One Year Later  jump in time in the DC Universe  DC canceled The Flash  vol  2  in January 2006 at #230  A new series  The Flash  The Fastest Man Alive  began on June 21  2006  The initial story arc of this series  written by Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo with art by Ken Lashley  focused on Bart Allens acceptance of the role of the Flash   Flash  Fastest Man Alive was canceled with issue #13  In its place The Flash  vol  2  was revived with issue #231  with Andrew Ablog as the initial writer  Waid also wrote All Flash #1  which acted as the bridge between the two series  DC had solicited Flash  Fastest Man Alive through issue #15  All Flash #1 replaced issue #14 and The Flash  vol  2  #231 replaced issue #15 in title and interior creative team only  The covers and cover artists were as solicited by DC  and the information text released was devoid of any plot information   In 2009  Barry Allen made a full fledged return to the DCU proper in The Flash  Rebirth  a six issue miniseries by Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver   2  Fictional character biographies  While several other individuals have used the name Flash  these have lived either on other parallel worlds  or in the future  Garrick  Allen  and West are the best known exemplars of the identity   2 1  Jay Garrick  Jason Peter  Jay  Garrick was a college student in 1938 who accidentally inhaled heavy water vapors after falling asleep in his laboratory where he had been working  As a result  he found that he could run at superhuman speed and had similarly fast reflexes  After a brief career as a college football star  he donned a red shirt with a lightning bolt and a stylized metal helmet with wings  based on images of the Greek deity Hermes   and began to fight crime as the Flash  His first case involved battling the  Faultless Four   a group of blackmailers  Jay kept his identity secret for years without a mask by continually vibrating his body while in public so that any photograph of his face would be blurred  Although originally from Earth Two  he was incorporated into the history of New Earth following the Crisis on Infinite Earths and is still active as the Flash operating out of Keystone City  He is a member of the Justice Society   2 2  Barry Allen  Bartholomew Henry  Barry  Allen is a police scientist who has a reputation for being very slow  deliberate  and frequently late  which frustrated his fiancée  Iris West  One night  as he was preparing to leave work  a lightning bolt shattered a case full of chemicals and spilled them all over Allen  As a result  Allen found that he could run extremely fast and had matching reflexes  He donned a set of red tights sporting a lightning bolt  reminiscent of the original Fawcett Comics Captain Marvel   dubbed himself the Flash  after his childhood hero  Jay Garrick   and became a crimefighter active in Central City  In his civilian identity  he stores the costume compressed in a special ring via the use of a special gas that could compress cloth fibers to a very small fraction of their normal size   Allen sacrificed his life for the universe in the 1985 maxi series Crisis on Infinite Earths  and remained dead for over twenty years after that story s publication  With the 2008 series Final Crisis  Allen returned to the DC Universe and returned to full prominence as the Flash in the 2009 series The Flash  Rebirth  which was soon after followed by a new volume of The Flash ongoing series  where Allen s adventures as the Scarlet Speedster are currently published   2 3  Wally West  Wallace Rudolph  Wally  West is the nephew of Iris West and of Barry Allen by marriage  and was introduced in The Flash  vol  1  #110  1959   When West was about ten years old  he was visiting his uncle s police laboratory  and the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself  bathing West in electrically charged chemicals  Now possessing the same powers as his uncle  West donned a copy of his uncle s outfit and became the young crime fighter Kid Flash  After the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths where Barry Allen was killed  Wally took over as the fastest man alive  Following the events of Infinite Crisis  Wally  his wife Linda  and their twins left Earth for an unknown dimension   Wally  his wife and twins were pulled back from the Speed Force by the Legion of Super Heroes at the conclusion of The Lightning Saga  This set the stage for Wally West s return as the Flash after the events of The Flash  Fastest Man Alive #13  see Bart Allen   in All Flash #1  and with The Flash  vol  2  series  which resumed with issue #231 in August 2007  It subsequently ends with issue #247  and West  along with all the other Flash characters  play a large role in 2009 s The Flash  Rebirth   2 4  Bart Allen  Bartholomew Henry  Bart  Allen II is the grandson of Barry Allen and his wife Iris  Bart suffered from accelerated aging and  as a result  was raised in a virtual reality machine until Iris took him back in time to get help from the then current Flash  Wally West  With Wally s help  Bart s aging slowed  and he took the name Impulse  After he was shot in the knee by Deathstroke  Bart changed both his attitude and his costume  taking the mantle of Kid Flash  During the events of Infinite Crisis  the Speed Force vanished  taking with it all the speedsters save Jay Garrick  Bart returned  four years older  and for a year claimed that he was depowered from the event  However  the Speed Force had not disappeared completely  but had been absorbed into Bart s body  essentially  he now contained all of the Speed Force   Bart s costume as the Flash was a clone of his grandfather s  similarly stylized to Wally West s  Not long after taking the mantle of the Flash  Bart was killed by the Rogues in the 13th  and final  issue of The Flash  The Fastest Man Alive  However  he was later resurrected in the 31st century in Final Crisis  Legion of 3 Worlds #3 by Brainiac 5 to combat Superboy Prime and the Legion of Super Villains  Writer Geoff Johns confirmed that Bart will return to the past and play a large role in The Flash  Rebirth   2 5  Others to carry the mantle of the Flash  2 5 1  Jesse Chambers  Daughter of the speedster Johnny Quick  Jesse Chambers becomes a speeding superhero like her father  She later meets Wally West  the Flash  who asks her to be his replacement if something were to happen to him  as part of an elaborate plan on his part  trying to force Bart Allen to take his role in the legacy of the Flash more seriously   She briefly assumes the mantle of the Flash  after Wally enters the Speed Force   2 5 2  John Fox  John Fox was will be an historian for the National Academy of Science in Central City in the 27th Century  He was sent back in time to get the help of one or more of the three Flashes  Garrick  Allen  West   in order to defeat the radioactive villain Mota back in his own time  Fox s mission was a failure  but the tachyon radiation that sent him through the time stream gave him superspeed  He became his century s Flash for a time  shortly after  he moved to the 853rd century and joined  Justice Legion A   also known as Justice Legion Alpha  as seen in the DC One Million series of books  The name  John Fox  is combined from the names of seminal comic book writers John Broome  who co created the Barry Allen Flash  and Gardner Fox  who co created the Jay Garrick Flash   2 5 3  Unnamed Allen of the 23rd century  The father of Sela Allen  his wife and daughter were captured by Cobalt Blue  He is forced to watch his wife die and his daughter become crippled  As he and Max Mercury kill Cobalt Blue  a child takes the gem and kills Allen  This Flash is one of the two destined Flashes to be killed by Cobalt Blue   2 5 4  Sela Allen  Sela Allen is an ordinary human in the 23rd century until Cobalt Blue steals electrical impulses away from her  causing her to become as slow to the world as the world is to the Flash  Hoping to restore her  her father takes her into the Speed Force  When her father is killed  she appears as a living manifestation of the Speed Force  able to lend speed to various people and objects  but unable to physically interact with the world   Blaine Allen and his son live on the colony world of Petrus in the 28th century  In an attempt to end the Allen blood line  Cobalt Blue injects Allen s son Jace with a virus  Lacking super speed  Jace was unable to shake off the virus  In despair  Blaine takes his son to the Speed Force in the hopes that it would accept him  It takes Blaine instead and grants super speed to Jace so that he can shake off the sickness   Jace Allen gains super speed when his father brings him into the Speed Force to attempt to cure him of a virus injected into his body by Cobalt Blue in an attempt to end the Allen bloodline  In memory of his father  Jace assumes the mantle of the Flash and continues the feud against Cobalt Blue   2 5 5  Kryad  After an alien creature invades Earth  a history buff named Kryad travels back in time from the 98th century to acquire a Green Lantern power ring  He fails  so he tries to capture the Flash s speed instead  After being beaten by Barry Allen  The Flash  vol  1  #309  May 1982   he travels back further in time and uses the chemicals from the clothes Barry Allen was wearing when he gained his powers  Kryad sacrifices his life to defeat the alien creature   2 5 6  Bizarro Flash  Bizarro Flash was created when Bizarro cloned Flash  He had a costume the reverse colors of Flash s  however he had a gavel symbol because Flash was holding one when he was cloned  The modern version of Bizarro Flash has the symbol of a thunderbolt shaped mustard stain   3  Powers and abilities  All incarnations of the Flash can move  think  and react at light speeds as well as having superhuman endurance that allows them to run incredible distances  He has ran fast enough to encounter God but the comic was discarded for religious reasons  Some  notably later versions  can vibrate so fast that they can pass through walls in a process called quantum tunneling    travel through time and can also lend and borrow speed  Furthermore  all members have an invisible aura around their bodies that prevents themselves and their clothes from being affected by air friction as they move at high speed  Speedsters can heal more rapidly than the average human   On several occasions  the Flash has raced against Superman  either to determine who is faster or as part of a mutual effort to thwart some type of threat  these races  however  often resulted in ties because of outside circumstances  Writer Jim Shooter and artist Curt Swan crafted the story  Superman s Race With the Flash   in Superman #199  Aug  1967  which featured the first race between the Flash and Superman  Writer E  Nelson Bridwell and artist Ross Andru produced  The Race to the End of the Universe   a follow up story four months later in The Flash #175  Dec  1967   However  after the DC Universe revision after Crisis on Infinite Earths  The Flash does successfully beat Superman in a race in Adventures of Superman #463 with the explanation that Superman is not accustomed to running at high speed for extended periods of time since flying is more versatile and less strenuous  which means the far more practiced Flash has the advantage  After Final Crisis in Flash  Rebirth #3 the Flash is shown as being much faster than Superman  able to outstripping him as Superman struggles to keep up with him  He reveals that all the close races between them had been  for charity    Speedsters may at times use the ability to speed read at incredible rates and in doing so  process vast amounts of information  Whatever knowledge they acquire in this manner is usually temporary  Bart Allen seems to be the exception  though in earlier years  Max Mercury believed that Bart s speed learning would not stick   Their ability to think fast also allows them some immunity to telepathy  as their thoughts operate at a rate too rapid for telepaths such as Martian Manhunter or Gorilla Grodd to read or influence their minds   Flashes and other super speedsters also have the ability to speak to one another at a highly accelerated rate  This is often done to have private conversations in front of non fast people  as when Flash speaks to Superman about his ability to serve both the Titans and the JLA in The Titans #2   Speed talking is also sometimes used for comedic effect where Flash becomes so excited that he begins talking faster and faster until his words become a jumble of noise   4  Other versions  In the final issue of 52  a new Multiverse is revealed  originally consisting of 52 identical realities  Among the parallel realities shown is one designated  Earth 2   As a result of Mister Mind  eating  aspects of this reality  it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre Crisis Earth 2  including the Flash among other Justice Society of America characters  The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear  but the Flash is visually similar to the Jay Garrick Flash  Based on comments by Grant Morrison  this alternate universe is not the pre Crisis Earth 2   A variant of the Flash   a superfast college student named Mary Maxwell   was seen in the Elseworld book Just Imagine Stan Lee Creating The Flash   4 1  Tanaka Rei  The Flash of Earth D  Rei was a Japanese man who idolized Barry Allen  whose stories only existed in comic books on this world  Rei was inspired by Allen to become the Flash  much like Allen was inspired to become the Flash by his idol  Jay Garrick  Allen and Rei met during the  Crisis on Infinite Earths  when Barry was coming back from the 30th century and arrived in the wrong universe  As Earth D was under attack by the shadow demons  Barry called on the Justice League and Tanaka called on the Justice Alliance  his world s version of the Justice League  They built a cosmic treadmill and were able to evacuate much of Earth D s population  The Justice League left  but 39 seconds later  Earth D perished   Rei made his only appearance in Legends of the DC Universe  Crisis on Infinite Earths  February 1999   The story was written by Marv Wolfman  with art by Paul Ryan  pencils  and Bob McLeod  ink    4 2  Lia Nelson  The young  female Flash of the Tangent Universe is not a speedster  but instead  the first child born in space  and a being made up of and able to control light  As a side effect  she can move at the speed of light  which actually makes her faster than most of the other Post Crisis Flashes  as only Wally West has ever survived a light speed run without becoming trapped in the Speed Force  She recently reappeared in Justice League of America #16  somehow summoned out of the paper  green lantern  of her universe   an artifact that survived the Crisis that erased the Tangent Universe from existence  Lia Nelson also appeared in Countdown  Arena battling two versions of the Flash from other Earths within the Multiverse  In the 52 Earth Multiverse  the Tangent Universe is designated Earth 9   4 3  Superman & Batman  Generations 2  In Superman & Batman  Generations 2  three different Flashes appear  Wally West as Kid Flash in 1964  Wally s cousin

created by Kyle Rayner s subconscious  who later re fused into his mind   4 5  Ame Comi  A teenage version of Jesse Chambers appears as the Flash of the Ame Comi universe  As with most of the other characters of that Earth  she sports an Anime inspired costume   4 6  The Crash  The 1980s series Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew presented the parallel Earth of  Earth C Minus   a world populated by funny animal superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe  Earth C Minus was the home of the Crash  a turtle with super speed powers similar to those of Barry Allen s  and a member of his world s superhero team  the Just a Lotta Animals  The Crash as a youth had read comics about Earth C s Terrific Whatzit  similar to how Barry Allen enjoyed comics about Earth Two s Jay Garrick   4 7  Danica Williams  An African American teenager named Danica Williams appears as the Flash in the Justice League Beyond series  acting as Wally West s successor during the 2040s  following the events of Batman Beyond   She is employed at the Flash Museum in Central City  and like Barry Allen  is chronically late   5  Writers  The following writers have been involved in the

called Fili Second   9  Rogues  Like Batman  the Flash has a reputation for having fought a distinctive and memorable rogues gallery of supervillains  In the Flash s case  some of these villains have adopted the term  Flash s Rogues Gallery  as an official title  and insist on being called  Rogues  rather than  supervillains  or similar names  At times  various combinations of the Rogues have banded together to commit crimes or take revenge on the Flash  usually under the leadership of Captain Cold   The Rogues are known for their communal style relationship  socializing together and operating under a strict moral code  sometimes brutally enforced by Captain Cold  Such  rules  include  no drugs  and  except in very dire situations or on unique occasions   no killing    Considering the blue collar nature of the Flash s Rogues  more than a few have protested the inclusion of Professor Zoom and Abra Kadabra  often labeling them psychotic  as time travel generally works against their crimes and  at least in the original Zoom s case  they found him dangerous and too willing to kill   In contrast  several new Flash villains have been considered Rogues  including Murmur  Double Down  and Peek A Boo  but they play second fiddle to new incarnations of Captain Boomerang  Zoom  Mirror Master  and Inertia  a variation on Reverse Flash  clone of Impulse    10  Notes  11
