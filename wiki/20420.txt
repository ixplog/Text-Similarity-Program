Multimedia refers to content that uses a combination of different content forms  This contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text only or traditional forms of printed or hand produced material  Multimedia includes a combination of text  audio  still images  animation  video  or interactivity content forms   Multimedia is usually recorded and played  displayed  or accessed by information content processing devices  such as computerized and electronic devices  but can also be part of a live performance  Multimedia devices are electronic media devices used to store and experience multimedia content  Multimedia is distinguished from mixed media in fine art  by including audio  for example  it has a broader scope  The term  rich media  is synonymous for interactive multimedia  Hypermedia can be considered one particular multimedia application   1  Categorization of multimedia  Multimedia may be broadly divided into linear and non linear categories  Linear active content progresses often without any navigational control for the viewer such as a cinema presentation  Non linear uses interactivity to control progress as with a video game or self paced computer based training  Hypermedia is an example of non linear content   Multimedia presentations can be live or recorded  A recorded presentation may allow interactivity via a navigation system  A live multimedia presentation may allow interactivity via an interaction with the presenter or performer   2  Major characteristics of multimedia  Multimedia presentations may be viewed by person on stage  projected  transmitted  or played locally with a media player  A broadcast may be a live or recorded multimedia presentation  Broadcasts and recordings can be either analog or digital electronic media technology  Digital online multimedia may be downloaded or streamed  Streaming multimedia may be live or on demand   Multimedia games and simulations may be used in a physical environment with special effects  with multiple users in an online network  or locally with an offline computer  game system  or simulator   The various formats of technological or digital multimedia may be intended to enhance the users  experience  for example to make it easier and faster to convey information  Or in entertainment or art  to transcend everyday experience   Enhanced levels of interactivity are made possible by combining multiple forms of media content  Online multimedia is increasingly becoming object oriented and data driven  enabling applications with collaborative end user innovation and personalization on multiple forms of content over time  Examples of these range from multiple forms of content on Web sites like photo galleries with both images  pictures  and title  text  user updated  to simulations whose co efficients  events  illustrations  animations or videos are modifiable  allowing the multimedia  experience  to be altered without reprogramming  In addition to seeing and hearing  Haptic technology enables virtual objects to be felt  Emerging technology involving illusions of taste and smell may also enhance the multimedia experience   3  Terminology  3 1  History of the term  The term multimedia was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein  later  Bobb Goldsteinn   to promote the July 1966 opening of his  LightWorks at L Oursin  show at Southampton  Long Island  Goldstein was perhaps aware of a British artist named Dick Higgins  who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art making he called  intermedia    On August 10  1966  Richard Albarino of Variety borrowed the terminology  reporting   Brainchild of songscribe comic Bob   Washington Square   Goldstein  the  Lightworks  is the latest multi media music cum visuals to debut as discothèque fare   Two years later  in 1968  the term  multimedia  was re appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant  David Sawyer  the husband of Iris Sawyer—one of Goldstein’s producers at L’Oursin   In the intervening forty years  the word has taken on different meanings  In the late 1970s  the term referred to presentations consisting of multi projector slide shows timed to an audio track  However  by the 1990s  multimedia  took on its current meaning   In the 1993 first edition of McGraw Hill’s Multimedia  Making It Work  Tay Vaughan declared “Multimedia is any combination of text  graphic art  sound  animation  and video that is delivered by computer  When you allow the user – the viewer of the project – to control what and when these elements are delivered  it is interactive multimedia  When you provide a structure of linked elements through which the user can navigate  interactive multimedia becomes hypermedia ”  The German language society  Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache  decided to recognize the word s significance and ubiquitousness in the 1990s by awarding it the title of  Word of the Year  in 1995  The institute summed up its rationale by stating   Multimedia  has become a central word in the wonderful new media world   In common usage  multimedia refers to an electronically delivered combination of media including video  still images  audio  text in such a way that can be accessed interactively  Much of the content on the web today falls within this definition as understood by millions  Some computers which were marketed in the 1990s were called  multimedia  computers because they incorporated a CD ROM drive  which allowed for the delivery of several hundred megabytes of video  picture  and audio data  That era saw also a boost in the production of educational multimedia CD ROMs   3 2  Word usage and context  Since media is the plural of medium  the term  multimedia  is used to describe multiple occurrences of only one form of media such as a collection of audio CDs  This is why it s important that the word  multimedia  is used exclusively to describe multiple forms of media and content   The term  multimedia  is also ambiguous  Static content  such as a paper book  may be considered multimedia if it contains both pictures and text or may be considered interactive if the user interacts by turning pages at will  Books may also be considered non linear if the pages are accessed non sequentially  The term  video   if not used exclusively to describe motion photography  is ambiguous in multimedia terminology  Video is often used to describe the file format  delivery format  or presentation format instead of  footage  which is used to distinguish motion photography from  animation  of rendered motion imagery  Multiple forms of information content are often not considered modern forms of presentation such as audio or video  Likewise  single forms of information content with single methods of information processing  e g  non interactive audio  are often called multimedia  perhaps to distinguish static media from active media  In the Fine arts  for example  Leda Luss Luyken s ModulArt brings two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting  variation of a theme and movement of and within a picture  making ModulArt an interactive multimedia form of art  Performing arts may also be considered multimedia considering that performers and props are multiple forms of both content and media   The Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache chose Multimedia as German Word of the Year 1995   4  Usage   Application  Multimedia finds its application in various areas including  but not limited to  advertisements  art  education  entertainment  engineering  medicine  mathematics  business  scientific research and spatial temporal applications  Several examples are as follows   4 1  Creative industries  Creative industries use multimedia for a variety of purposes ranging from fine arts  to entertainment  to commercial art  to journalism  to media and software services provided for any of the industries listed below  An individual multimedia designer may cover the spectrum throughout their career  Request for their skills range from technical  to analytical  to creative   4 1 1  Commercial uses  Much of the electronic old and new media used by commercial artists is multimedia  Exciting presentations are used to grab and keep attention in advertising  Business to business  and interoffice communications are often developed by creative services firms for advanced multimedia presentations beyond simple slide shows to sell ideas or liven up training  Commercial multimedia developers may be hired to design for governmental services and nonprofit services applications as well   4 1 2  Entertainment and fine arts  In addition  multimedia is heavily used in the entertainment industry  especially to develop special effects in movies and animations VFX  3D animation  etc    Multimedia games are a popular pastime and are software programs available either as CD ROMs or online  Some video games also use multimedia features  Multimedia applications that allow users to actively participate instead of just sitting by as passive recipients of information are called Interactive Multimedia  In the Arts there are multimedia artists  whose minds are able to blend techniques using different media that in some way incorporates interaction with the viewer  One of the most relevant could be Peter Greenaway who is melding Cinema with Opera and all sorts of digital media  Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena  such as an art gallery  Although multimedia display material may be volatile  the survivability of the content is as strong as any traditional media  Digital recording material may be just as durable and infinitely reproducible with perfect copies every time   4 1 3  Education  In Education  multimedia is used to produce computer based training courses  popularly called CBTs  and reference books like encyclopedia and almanacs  A CBT lets the user go through a series of presentations  text about a particular topic  and associated illustrations in various information formats  Edutainment is the combination of education with entertainment  especially multimedia entertainment   Learning theory in the past decade has expanded dramatically because of the introduction of multimedia  Several lines of research have evolved  e g  Cognitive load  Multimedia learning  and the list goes on   The possibilities for learning and instruction are nearly endless   The idea of media convergence is also becoming a major factor in education  particularly higher education  Defined as separate technologies such as voice  and telephony features   data  and productivity applications  and video that now share resources and interact with each other  synergistically creating new efficiencies  media convergence is rapidly changing the curriculum in universities all over the world  Likewise  it is changing the availability  or lack thereof  of jobs requiring this savvy technological skill   The English education in middle school in China is well invested and assisted with various equipments  In contrast  the original objective has not been achieved at the desired effect  The government  schools  families  and students spend a lot of time working on improving scores  but hardly gain practical skills  English education today has gone into the vicious circle  Educators need to consider how to perfect the education system to improve students’ practical ability of English  Therefore an efficient way should be used to make the class vivid  Multimedia teaching will bring students into a class where they can interact with the teacher and the subject  Multimedia teaching is more intuitive than old ways  teachers can simulate situations in real life  In many circumstances teachers do not have to be there  students will learn by themselves in the class  More importantly  teachers will have more approaches to stimulating students’ passion of learning   4 1 4  Journalism  Newspaper companies all over are also trying to embrace the new phenomenon by implementing its practices in their work  While some have been slow to come around  other major newspapers like The New York Times  USA Today and The Washington Post are setting the precedent for the positioning of the newspaper industry in a globalized world   News reporting is not limited to traditional media outlets  Freelance journalists can make use of different new media to produce multimedia pieces for their news stories  It engages global audiences and tells stories with technology  which develops new communication techniques for both media producers and consumers  Common Language Project is an example of this type of multimedia journalism production   Multimedia reporters who are mobile  usually driving around a community with cameras  audio and video recorders  and wifi equipped laptop computers  are often referred to as Mojos  from mobile journalist   4 1 5  Engineering  Software engineers may use multimedia in Computer Simulations for anything from entertainment to training such as military or industrial training  Multimedia for software interfaces are often done as a collaboration between creative professionals and software engineers   4 1 6  Industry  In the Industrial sector  multimedia is used as a way to help present information to shareholders  superiors and coworkers  Multimedia is also helpful for providing employee training  advertising and selling products all over the world via virtually unlimited web based technology   4 1 7  Mathematical and scientific research  In mathematical and scientific research  multimedia is mainly used for modeling and simulation  For example  a scientist can look at a molecular model of a particular substance and manipulate it to arrive at a new substance  Representative research can be found in journals such as the Journal of Multimedia   4 1 8  Medicine  In Medicine  doctors can get trained by looking at a virtual surgery or they can simulate how the human body is affected by diseases spread by viruses and bacteria and then develop techniques to prevent it   4 1 9  Document imaging  Document imaging is a technique that takes hard copy of an image document and converts it into a digital format  for example  scanners    4 1 10  Disabilities  Ability Media allows those with disabilities to gain qualifications in the multimedia field so they can pursue careers that give them access to a wide array of powerful communication forms   4 2  Miscellaneous  In Europe  the reference organisation for Multimedia industry is the European Multimedia Associations Convention  EMMAC    5  Structuring information in a multimedia form  Multimedia represents the convergence of text  pictures  video and sound into a single form  The power of multimedia and the Internet lies in the way in which information is linked   Multimedia and the Internet require a completely new approach to writing  The style of writing that is appropriate for the  on line world  is highly optimized and designed to be able to be quickly scanned by readers   A good site must be made with a specific purpose in mind and a site with good interactivity and new technology can also be useful for attracting visitors  The site must be attractive and innovative in its design  function in terms of its purpose  easy to navigate  frequently updated and fast to download   When users view a page  they can only view one page at a time  As a result  multimedia users must create a  mental model  of information structure   6  Conferences  There is a   the two main scholarly scientific conferences being   ACM Multimedia   IEEE ICME  International Conference on Multimedia & Expo   7  See also  Artmedia  Cross media  Multi Image  Multimedia literacy  Multimedia Messaging Service  Multimedia search  New media art
