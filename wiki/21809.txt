The National Hockey League  NHL    is a professional ice hockey league composed of 30 member clubs  23 in the United States and 7 in Canada  Headquartered in New York City  the NHL is widely considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world  and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada  The Stanley Cup  the oldest professional sports trophy in North America  is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season   The National Hockey League was organized on November 26  1917  in Montreal  Quebec  after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization  the National Hockey Association  NHA   which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew Ontario  It started with four teams  all based in Canada  and  through a series of expansions  contractions  and relocations  is now composed of thirty active franchises  The  nation  referred to by the league s name was Canada  although the league has now been binational since 1924 when its first team in the United States  the Boston Bruins  began play  After a labour management dispute that led to the cancellation of the entire 2004–05 season  the league resumed play under a new collective agreement that included a salary cap  In 2009  the NHL enjoyed record highs in terms of sponsorships  attendance  and television audiences   The league draws many highly skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from approximately 20 different countries  Canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the league  with a dramatically increasing percentage of American and European players in recent years   1  History  1 1  Early years  The National Hockey League was established in 1917 as the successor to the National Hockey Association  NHA   officially called the National Hockey Association of Canada Limited  Founded by Ambrose O Brien in 1909  the NHA began play one year later with seven teams in Ontario and Quebec  and was one of the first major leagues in professional ice hockey  But by the NHA s eighth season  a series of disputes with Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone led the other team owners  representing the Montreal Canadiens  Montreal Wanderers  Ottawa Senators  and Quebec Bulldogs to meet at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal to talk about the league s future  Realizing the league constitution left them unable to force Livingstone out  the four teams voted instead to suspend the NHA  and on November 26  1917  formed the National Hockey League  While a full member of the new league  the Bulldogs were unable to play  and the remaining owners created a new team in Toronto  the Arenas  to compete with the Canadiens  Wanderers and Senators  The first games were played three weeks later on December 19  Joe Malone scored five goals in a 7–4 victory for the Canadiens over the Senators on opening night  he finished the 1917–18 season with 44 goals in 20 games  The league nearly collapsed in January 1918 when the Montreal Arena burned down  causing the Wanderers to cease operations and forcing the Canadiens to hastily find a new arena  The NHL continued on as a three team league until the Bulldogs returned in 1919   Toronto won the first league title  then defeated the Pacific Coast Hockey Association s Vancouver Millionaires to win the 1918 Stanley Cup The Canadiens won the league title in 1919  however their Stanley Cup Final against the Seattle Metropolitans was abandoned with the series tied after several players became ill as a result of the Spanish Flu epidemic that resulted in Montreal defenceman Joe Hall s death  Montreal defeated the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League  WCHL  in 1924 to win their first Stanley Cup as a member of the NHL  The Hamilton Tigers  who had relocated from Quebec in 1920  won the regular season title in 1924–25 but refused to play in the championship series unless they were given a C$200 bonus  The league refused and declared the Canadiens the league champion after they defeated the Toronto St  Patricks  formerly the Arenas  in the semi final  Montreal was then defeated by the Victoria Cougars for the 1925 Stanley Cup  It was the last time a non NHL team won the trophy  as the Stanley Cup became the de facto NHL championship in 1926 after the WCHL ceased operation   1 2  Expansion into the United States and the Original Six  The National Hockey League embarked on rapid expansion in the 1920s  adding the Montreal Maroons and Boston Bruins in 1924  The Bruins were the first American team in the league  while the Maroons played in the newly completed Montreal Forum that the Canadiens made famous in later decades  The New York Americans began play in 1925 after purchasing the assets of the Hamilton Tigers  and were joined by the Pittsburgh Pirates  Tex Rickard  owner of Madison Square Garden  was so impressed with the popularity of the Americans that he added the New York Rangers in 1926  The Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Cougars  later Red Wings  were also added after the league purchased the assets of the defunct WCHL  A group headed by Conn Smythe purchased the Toronto St  Patricks in 1927  immediately renamed them the Maple Leafs  and built Maple Leaf Gardens in 1931   The Great Depression and the onset of World War II took a toll on the league  The Pirates became the Philadelphia Quakers in 1930  then folded one year later  The Senators likewise became the St  Louis Eagles in 1934  also lasting only one year  The Canadiens were nearly sold and relocated to Cleveland  Ohio in 1936 before a trio of local owners purchased the team and kept them in Montreal  The Maroons did not survive  however  as they suspended operations in 1938  The Americans were suspended in 1942 due to a lack of players  and never revived  The league was reduced to six teams for the 1942–43 NHL season  the Boston Bruins  Chicago Black Hawks  Detroit Red Wings  Montreal Canadiens  New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs  These six teams remained constant for 25 years  a period known as the Original Six   The first NHL All Star Game was held in 1934 to benefit Ace Bailey  whose career ended on a vicious hit by Eddie Shore  The second was held in 1937 in support of Howie Morenz s family when he died of a coronary embolism after breaking his leg during a game  His teammate Aurel Joliat said that Morenz  died of a broken heart  when he learned he would never play hockey again  Maurice  Rocket  Richard became the first player to score 50 goals  doing so in a 50 game season  Ten years later he was suspended for the 1955 Stanley Cup playoffs for punching a linesman  an incident that led to the Richard Riot  He returned to lead the Canadiens to five consecutive titles between 1956 and 1960  a record no team has matched  Willie O Ree broke the league s colour barrier on January 18  1958 when he made his debut with the Boston Bruins and became the first black player in league history   1 3  Post Original Six expansion  By the mid 1960s  the desire for a network television contract in the U S   and concerns that the Western Hockey League was planning to declare itself a major league and challenge for the Stanley Cup  spurred the league to undertake its first expansion since the 1920s  The league doubled in size for the 1967–68 season  adding the Los Angeles Kings  Minnesota North Stars  Philadelphia Flyers  Pittsburgh Penguins  California Seals and St  Louis Blues  Canadian fans were outraged that all six teams were placed in the United States  and the league responded by adding the Vancouver Canucks in 1970 along with the Buffalo Sabres  who are located on the U S  Canadian border  Two years later  the emergence of the newly founded World Hockey Association  WHA  led the league to add the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames to keep the rival league out of those markets  In 1974  the Washington Capitals and Kansas City Scouts were added  bringing the league up to 18 teams   The National Hockey League fought the WHA for players  losing 67 to the new league in its first season of 1972–73  including Bobby Hull  who signed a ten year  $2 5 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets  the largest in hockey history at the time  The league attempted to block the defections in court  but a counter suit by the WHA led to a Philadelphia judge ruling the NHL s reserve clause to be illegal  thus eliminating the elder league s monopoly over the players  Seven years of battling for players and markets financially damaged both leagues  leading to a 1979 merger agreement that saw the WHA cease operations while the NHL absorbed the Winnipeg Jets  Edmonton Oilers  Hartford Whalers and Quebec Nordiques  The owners initially rejected this merger agreement by one vote  but a massive boycott of Molson Brewery products by fans in Canada caused the Montreal Canadiens  which was owned by Molson  to reverse its position  along with the Vancouver Canucks  In a second vote the plan was approved   Wayne Gretzky played one season in the WHA for the Indianapolis Racers  eight games  and the Edmonton Oilers  72 games  before the Oilers joined the National Hockey League for the 1979–80 season  Gretzky went on to lead the Oilers to four Stanley Cup championships in 1984  1985  1987 and 1988  and set single season records for goals  92 in 1981–82   assists  163 in 1985–86  and points  215 in 1985–86   as well as career records for goals  894   assists  1 963  and points  2 857   He was traded to the Kings in 1988  a deal that dramatically improved the league s popularity in the United States  and provided the impetus for the 1990s expansion cycles that saw the addition of nine teams  the San Jose Sharks  Tampa Bay Lightning  Ottawa Senators  Mighty Ducks of Anaheim  Florida Panthers  Nashville Predators  Atlanta Thrashers  and in 2000 the Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets   1 4  Labour issues  There have been four league wide work stoppages in league history  all happening since 1992   The first was a strike by the National Hockey League Players  Association in April 1992 which lasted for ten days  but the strike was settled quickly and all affected games were rescheduled  A lockout at the start of the 1994–95 season forced the league to reduce the schedule from 84 games to just 48  with the teams playing only intra conference games during the reduced season  The resulting collective bargaining agreement  CBA  was set for renegotiation in 1998 and extended to September 15  2004   With no new agreement in hand when the contract expired on September 15  2004  league commissioner Gary Bettman announced a lockout of the players union and closed the league s head office  The league vowed to install what it dubbed  cost certainty  for its teams  but the Players  Association countered that the move was little more than a euphemism for a salary cap  which the union initially said it would not accept  The lockout shut down the league for 310 days  the longest in sports history  The NHL became the first professional sports league to lose an entire season  A new collective bargaining agreement was eventually ratified in July 2005  including a salary cap  The agreement had a term of six years with an option of extending the collective bargaining agreement for an additional year at the end of the term  allowing the league to resume as of the 2005–06 season   On October 5  2005  the first post lockout season took to the ice with 15 games  and consequently all 30 teams  Of those 15 games  11 were in front of sell out crowds  The NHL received record attendance in the 2005–06 season  20 854 169 fans  an average of 16 955 per game  a 1 2% increase over the previous mark held in the 2001–02 season  Also  the Montreal Canadiens  Calgary Flames  Colorado Avalanche  Minnesota Wild  Tampa Bay Lightning  and the Vancouver Canucks sold out all of their home games  all six Canadian teams played to 98% capacity or better at every home game  24 of the 30 clubs finished even or ahead of their 2003–04 mark  The Pittsburgh Penguins had the highest increase at 33%  mainly because of 18 year old first overall draft pick Sidney Crosby  After losing a season to a labour dispute in 2005  attendance figures for league teams returned to solid ground  the League s TV audience was slower to rebound because of American cable broadcaster ESPN s decision to drop the sport from its schedule  The league s post lockout agreement with NBC gave the league a share of revenue from each game s advertising sales  rather than the usual lump sum paid up front for game rights  The league s annual revenues were estimated at approximately $2 27 billion   At midnight September 16  2012  the labour pact expired  and the league again locked out the players  The owners proposed reducing the players  share of hockey related revenues from 57 percent to 47 percent  All games were cancelled up to January 14  2013  as well as the 2013 NHL Winter Classic and the 2013 NHL All Star Weekend  A tentative agreement was reached on January 6  2013  on a ten year deal  On January 12  the league and the Players  Association signed a memorandum of understanding on the new deal  allowing teams to begin their training camps on January 13  with a shortened 48 game season schedule that began on January 19   1 5  Player safety issues  Player safety has become a major issue within the past five years and concussions  which result from a hard hit to the head  have been the biggest cause  With recent studies showing how concussions can affected retired players and how it has decreased their quality of life after retirement  concussions have become a very important topic of debate when it comes to player safety issues  This had significant effects on the league as elite players were being taken out of the game  such as Sidney Crosby being sidelined for approximately 10 and a half months  which adversely affected the league s marketability  As a result  in December 2009  Brendan Shanahan was hired to replace Colin Campbell and given the role of Senior Vice President of Player Safety  Shanahan began to hand out suspensions on high profile perpetrators responsible for dangerous hits  such as Raffi Torres receiving 25 games for his hit on Marian Hossa   To aid with removing high speed collisions on icing  which had led to several potential career ending injuries such as Hurricanes  Defencemen Joni Pitkanen  the league mandated hybrid no touch icing for the 2013–14 NHL season   On November 25  2013  ten former players  Gary Leeman  Rick Vaive  Brad Aitken  Darren Banks  Curt Bennett  Richie Dunn  Warren Holmes  Bob Manno  Blair Stewart and Morris Titanic sued the league for negligence on protecting players from concussions  The suit came three months after the NFL agreed to pay former players US$765 million due to a player safety lawsuit   2  Organizational structure  The Board of Governors is the ruling and governing body of the league  In this context  each team is a member of the league  and each member appoints a Governor  usually the owner of the club   and two alternates to the Board  The current chairman of the Board is Boston Bruins owner  Jeremy Jacobs  The Board of Governors exists to establish the policies of the league  and to uphold its constitution  Some of the responsibilities of the Board of Governors include   review and approve any rule changes to the game  hiring and firing of the commissioner  review and approve the purchase  sale  or relocation of any member club   review and approve the salary caps for member clubs   review and approve any changes to the structure of the game schedule The Board of Governors meets twice per year  in June and December  with the exact date and place to be fixed by the Commissioner   2 1  Executives  The chief executive of the league is Commissioner Gary Bettman  Some of the principal decision makers who serve under the authority of the commissioner include   Deputy Commissioner & Chief Legal Officer  Bill Daly  Executive VP & CFO  Craig Harnett  Chief Operating Officer  John Collins  Executive VP & Director of Hockey Operations  Colin Campbell  NHL Enterprises  Ed Horne  Senior Vice President of Player Safety  Stephane Quintal  3  Teams  The National Hockey League originated in 1917 with four Canadian teams  which after a tumultuous first quarter century  found stability in the Original Six era spanning 1942–67 with four franchises in the United States joining two Canadian clubs  Through a sequence of team expansions  reductions  and relocations the NHL currently consists of 30 teams  23 of which are based in the United States and seven in Canada  The Montreal Canadiens are the most successful franchise with 24 Stanley Cup championships  23 as an NHL team  1 as an NHA team   Of the four major professional sports leagues in North America  the Montreal Canadiens are only surpassed in the number of championships by the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball  who have three more  The next most successful franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 Stanley Cup championships  but they have not won one since 1967  The Detroit Red Wings  with 11 Stanley Cup championships  are the most successful American franchise  The longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five  held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955–56 to 1959–60  the New York Islanders  1980–1983  and the Montreal Canadiens  1976–1979  have four year championship streaks  The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens  the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions  was named by ESPN as the second greatest sports team of all time   Of all the major leagues in North America  the NHL is the only league to field teams that play in two countries  capital cities  Ottawa  Ontario and Washington  D C   The current 30 team NHL organization divides the teams into two conferences  the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference  Each conference is split into two divisions  the Eastern Conference contains 16 teams  eight per division   while the Western Conference has 14 teams  seven per division   The current organization had roots in the 1998–99 season when a league realignment added two divisions to bring the total number of divisions to six  the former team alignment began with the 2000–01 season when the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets joined the league as expansion teams   Sixteen of the league s thirty teams  the entire Eastern Conference  are located in the Eastern Time Zone  On the other hand  the Western Conference has six teams in the Central Time Zone  and 4 each in the Mountain and Pacific Time Zones  Up until the 2012–13 season  the Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets were the only Eastern Time teams in the Western Conference  and Winnipeg Jets was the only non Eastern Time team in the Eastern Conference  a temporary alignment resulting from the franchise s move out of Atlanta in 2011    3 1  Realignment  The relocation of the former Atlanta Thrashers franchise to become the current Winnipeg Jets in 2011 prompted the league to discuss realignment  On December 5  2011  the Board of Governors approved a conference realignment plan that would eliminate the current six division setup and move into a four conference structure  Under the plan  which was designed to better accommodate the effects of time zone differences  each team would have played 36 or 38 intra conference games  depending on whether it is in a seven  or eight team conference  and two games  home and road  against each non conference team  On January 6  2012  the league announced that the NHL Player s Association had rejected the proposed realignment  citing concerns about fairness  travel and the inability to see a draft schedule before approving  and that as a result  it would not implement the realignment until at least 2013–14   Upon NHLPA rejection of the previous realignment  a new joint NHL NHLPA plan was proposed in February 2013 as a modification of the previous plan with both the Columbus Blue Jackets and Detroit Red Wings moving to the East and the Winnipeg Jets moving to the West  This revised plan also adjusted the previously proposed four conference system to a four division  two conference system  with the Eastern Conference consisting of two eight team divisions  and the Western Conference consisting of two seven team divisions  A new playoff format was also introduced to accommodate the new proposal  with the top three teams in each division making the playoffs along with two wild cards in each conference  for a total of 16 playoff teams   The NHLPA officially gave its consent to the NHL s proposed realignment plan on March 7  and then the NHL s Board of Governors approved the realignment and the new playoff format on March 14  to be implemented prior to the 2013–14 season  The league then announced the names of the divisions on July 19  the two eight team divisions in the Eastern Conference are the Atlantic Division and the Metropolitan Division  and the two seven team divisions in the Western Conference are the Central Division and the Pacific Division   3 2  List of teams    Notes  An asterisk  *  denotes a franchise move  See the respective team articles for more information   The Edmonton Oilers  Hartford Whalers  Quebec Nordiques  and original Winnipeg Jets all joined the NHL in 1979 as part of the NHL–WHA merger   3 3  Defunct and relocated teams  Nineteen NHL teams have either folded or relocated  The first team to disband was the Montreal Wanderers in 1918  following the destruction of their arena by fire just four games into the season  The blaze destroyed all the team s equipment  and as a consequence the players were dispersed among the three remaining teams  The first team to relocate was the Quebec Athletic Club  who relocated to Hamilton  Ontario in 1920 to become the Hamilton Tigers  NHL president Frank Calder stripped the franchise from owner Mike Quinn and sold it to a Hamilton based company  Three franchises succumbed to the economic pressures of the Great Depression  the Philadelphia Quakers  St  Louis Eagles  and Montreal Maroons  The Brooklyn Americans were the last team to fold in the NHL  In the early 1940s  the franchise was struggling financially  and was suspended prior to the due to a lack of players during World War II  The franchise formally ceased operations in 1946  and their demise began a period in the league s history known as the  Original Six    The 1967 NHL expansion added six teams  but one of those teams  the California Golden Seals  moved to Cleveland  becoming the Cleveland Barons  before merging with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978 when both clubs were on the verge of folding  Kansas City relocated to Denver after only 2 years  becoming the Colorado Rockies  who subsequently moved to New Jersey  Devils  in 1982  With six more expansion teams in the 1970s  and the 1979 NHL–WHA merger  the league had 21 teams at the end of the decade  Three of the four teams from the merger have since relocated to other cities  the Quebec Nordiques  the original Winnipeg Jets  and the Hartford Whalers  The Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver becoming the Colorado Avalanche in 1995  the Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix becoming the Coyotes in 1996  and the Hartford Whalers moved to Greensboro  North Carolina  becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997  The Atlanta Flames moved to Calgary in 1980   During the 2011 playoffs  the Atlanta Thrashers franchise was acquired by True North Sports and Entertainment  who moved the team to Winnipeg for 2011–12  giving the team the revived name Winnipeg Jets   4  Game  Each National Hockey League regulation game is played between two teams and is 60 minutes long  The game is composed of three 20 minute periods with an intermission of either 15½ or 17 minutes  if nationally televised  between periods  Television timeouts are taken at the first stoppage of play after 6  10  and 14 minutes of elapsed time of each of the three regulation periods  unless a power play is in session at the time or the first stoppage is the result of a goal scored  In these cases  the timeout will occur at the first stoppage after the penalty expires or the next stoppage after the goal  respectively  A rule that was introduced in the 2007–08 season was that if the first stoppage of play after said time periods is an icing call  the TV timeout will not occur  This rule was added shortly after the league instituted a rule that disallows the team who ices the puck to substitute their players on the ice at the time of the icing  The rule was added so that a TV timeout would not compromise the inability to be substituted  At the end of the 60 minute regulation time  the team with the most goals wins the game  If a game is tied after regulation time  overtime ensues  During the regular season  overtime is a five minute  four player on four player sudden death period  in which the first team to score a goal wins the game   Beginning in the 2005–06 season  if the game is still tied at the end of overtime  the game enters a shootout  Three players for each team in turn take a penalty shot  The team with the most goals during the three round shootout wins the game  If the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds  the shootout continues but becomes sudden death  Whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings  The losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded only one  Shootout goals and saves are not tracked in hockey statistics  shootout statistics are tracked separately   There are no shootouts during the Playoffs  Instead  multiple sudden death  20 minute five on five periods are played until one team scores  While in theory a game could continue indefinitely  only four games have reached five overtime periods  two of those have reached six  and none have gone beyond six  There are no television time outs during playoff overtime periods  the only break is to clean the loose ice at the first stoppage after the period is halfway finished   5  Hockey rink  National Hockey League games are played on a rectangular hockey rink with rounded corners surrounded by walls and Plexiglas  It measures by in the NHL  approximately the same length but much narrower than International Ice Hockey Federation standards  The centre line divides the ice in half  and is used to judge icing violations  There are two blue lines that divide the rink roughly into thirds  delineating one neutral and two attacking zones  Near the end of both ends of the rink  there is a thin red goal line spanning the width of the ice  which is used to judge goals and icing calls   Starting in the 2005–2006 season  after testing in the American Hockey League  a trapezoidal area behind each goal net has been introduced  The goaltender can play the puck only within the trapezoid or in front of the goal line  if the goaltender plays the puck behind the goal line and outside the trapezoidal area  a two minute minor penalty for delay of game is assessed by the referees  The rule is unofficially nicknamed the  Martin Brodeur rule    Since the 2013–2014 season  the league trimmed the goal frames by on each side and reduced the size of the goalies  leg pads   6  Rules  The National Hockey League s rules are one of the two standard sets of rules in the world  The rules themselves have evolved directly from the first organized indoor ice hockey game in Montreal in 1875  updated by subsequent leagues up to 1917  when the NHL adopted the existing NHA set of rules  The NHL s rules are the basis for rules governing most ice hockey leagues in North America  Infractions of the rules  such as offside and icing  lead to a stoppage of play and subsequent face offs  while more serious infractions leading to penalties to the offending teams  The league also determines the specifications for playing equipment used in its games   The league has regularly modified its rules to counter perceived imperfections in the game  The penalty shot was adopted from the Pacific Coast Hockey Association to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score  For the 2005–06 season  the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside  First  the league removed the  offside pass  or  two line pass  rule  which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team s defending zone was completed on the offensive side of the centre line  unless the puck crossed the line before the player  Furthermore  the league reinstated the  tag up offside  which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone  The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring  which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid nineties and the increased prevalence of the neutral zone trap  Since 2005  when a team is guilty of icing the puck they are not allowed to make a line change or skater substitution of any sort before the following face off  except to replace an injured player or re install a pulled goaltender   Since 2013  the league has used hybrid icing  where a linesman stops play due to icing if a defending player  other than the goaltender  crosses the imaginary line that connects the two face off dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to  This was done to counter a trend of player injury in races to the puck   The league s rules differ from the rules of the International Ice Hockey Federation  IIHF   as used in tournaments such as the Olympics  which were themselves derived from the Canadian amateur ice hockey rules of the early 20th century  In the NHL  fighting leads to major penalties while IIHF rules  and most amateur rules  call for the ejection of fighting players  Usually a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus short handed for the duration of the penalty  but if the penalties are coincidental  for example when two players fight  both teams remain at full strength  Also  unlike minor penalties  major penalties must be served to their full completion  regardless of number of goals scored during the power play  The NHL and IIHF differ also in playing rules  such as icing  the areas of play for goaltenders  helmet rules  officiating rules  timeouts and play reviews   The league also imposes a conduct policy on its players  Players are banned from gambling and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players  The league and the Players  Association agreed to a stringent anti doping policy in the 2005 bargaining agreement  The policy provides for a twenty game suspension for a first positive test  a sixty game suspension for a second positive test  and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test   7  Season structure  The National Hockey League season is divided into an exhibition season  September   a regular season  from the first week in October through early to mid April  and a postseason  the Stanley Cup playoffs   During the exhibition season  teams may play other teams from the league  They also often compete against European clubs  such as clubs from the Russian Kontinental Hockey League  KHL   During the regular season  clubs play each other in a predefined schedule  The Stanley Cup playoffs  which go from April to the beginning of June  is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best of seven series in order to advance to the next round  The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion  Beginning in 2007  the NHL regular season has begun in Europe while teams not involved complete their pre season exhibition schedule   In the regular season  each team plays 82 games  41 games each of home and road  Eastern teams play 30 games in its own geographic division— four or five against each one of their seven other divisional opponents—and 24 games against the eight remaining non divisional intra conference opponents—three games against every team in the other division of its conference  Western teams play 28 or 29 games in its own geographic division four or five against each one of their six other divisional opponents and 21 or 22 games against the seven remaining non divisional intra conference opponents three games against every team in the other division of its conference  with one cross division intra conference match up occurring in four games  one team from each division plays only 28 intra division games in a given season  and rotates every season   All teams play every team in the other conference twice home and road  For three seasons between 2005 and 2008  teams played 32 games within their division—eight games against each team in the division—and 10 inter conference games—one game against each team in two of the three divisions in the opposite conference  The two divisions faced from the opposite conference were rotated every year  much like interleague play in Major League Baseball  As with the former system  each team played four games against each one of the other ten teams in its conference outside of its division   The league s regular season standings are based on a point system instead of winning percentages  Points are awarded for each game  where two points are awarded for a win  one point for losing in overtime or a shootout  and zero points for a loss in regulation  At the end of the regular season  the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion  The league s overall leader is awarded the Presidents  Trophy   Since 2014 the top three teams in each division plus the two wild card teams in the conference with the next highest number of points  for a total of eight teams in each conference  qualify for the playoffs  The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest seeded wild card team and the other division winner plays the highest seeded wild card  wild card teams may cross over to another division within the conference   and the next two teams with the next best records in each division are seeded 2nd and 3rd  The Stanley Cup playoffs is an elimination tournament  where the teams are grouped in pairs to play best of seven series  the winners moving on to the next round  The first round of the playoffs  or division semi finals  consists of the first seed playing the fourth seed  and the second playing the third  In the second round  or division finals  the two remaining teams in the division play each other  In the third round  the conference finals  the two division champions play each other  with the conference champions proceeding to the Stanley Cup Final   In all rounds the higher ranked team is awarded home ice advantage  Four of the seven games are played at this team s home venue—the first and second  and  when necessary  the fifth and seventh games—with the other games played at the lower ranked team s home venue  In the Stanley Cup Final  the team with the most points  or in case of a tie  most wins  during the regular season is given home ice advantage  regardless of where each team ranks in their own conference   8  Entry Draft  The annual NHL Entry Draft consists of a seven round off season draft held in late June  Amateur players from junior  collegiate  or European leagues are eligible to enter the Entry Draft  The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season  playoff results  and a draft lottery  The 14 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round  with the 30th place team having the best chance of winning the lottery  Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks  the order for the remaining non playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season  For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs  the draft order is then determined by the order in which they were eliminated  with the Stanley Cup winner getting the 30th and last pick  and the runner up is given the 29th pick   9  Trophies and awards  The National Hockey League presents a number of trophies each year  The most prestigious team award is the Stanley Cup  which is awarded to the league champion at the end of the Stanley Cup playoffs  The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the Presidents  Trophy  There are also numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season  they include  among others  the Art Ross Trophy for the league scoring champion  goals and assists   the Maurice  Rocket  Richard Trophy for the goal scoring leader  and the William M  Jennings Trophy for the goalkeeper s  for the team with the fewest goals against them   The other player trophies are voted on by the Professional Hockey Writers  Association or the team general managers  These individual awards are presented at a formal ceremony held in late June after the playoffs have concluded  The most prestigious individual award is the Hart Memorial Trophy which is awarded annually to the Most Valuable Player  the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season  The Vezina Trophy is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goalkeeper as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL  The James Norris Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the National Hockey League s top defenceman  the Calder Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the top rookie  and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship  all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association   In addition to the regular season awards  the Conn Smythe Trophy is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL s Stanley Cup playoffs  Furthermore  the top coach in the league wins the Jack Adams Award as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association  The National Hockey League publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards  and then names the award winner during the NHL Awards Ceremony   One interesting aspect for the trophies in the NHL is that the same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards  The Stanley Cup  much like its CFL counterpart  is unique in this aspect  as opposed to the Vince Lombardi Trophy  Larry O Brien Trophy  and Commissioner s Trophy  which have new ones made every year for that year s champion  Despite only one trophy being used  the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup  The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year   Players  coaches  officials  and team builders who have had notable careers are eligible to be voted into the Hockey Hall of Fame  Players cannot enter until three years have passed since their last professional game  the shortest such time period of any major sport  One unique consequence has been Hall of Fame members  specifically  Gordie Howe  Guy Lafleur  and Mario Lemieux  coming out of retirement to play once more  If a player was deemed significant enough  the three year wait would be waived  only ten individuals have been honoured in this manner  In 1999  Wayne Gretzky joined the Hall and became the last player to have the three year restriction waived  After his induction  the Hall of Fame announced that Gretzky would be the last to have the waiting period waived   10  Current season leaders  The top five point scorers in the 2013–14 season were Sidney Crosby  104   Ryan Getzlaf  87   Claude Giroux  86   Tyler Seguin  84   and Corey Perry  82   The top goal scorers were Alex Ovechkin  51   Perry  43   Joe Pavelski  41   Max Pacioretty  39   and Seguin  37   The top five scoring defencemen were Erik Karlsson  74   Duncan Keith  61   Shea Weber  56   Dustin Byfuglien  56   and Victor Hedman  55   The top goaltenders  by wins  were Semyon Varlamov  41   Antti Niemi  39   Marc Andre Fleury  39   Ben Bishop  37  and Tuukka Rask  36    11  Origin of players  In addition to Canadian and American born and trained players  who have historically composed a large majority of NHL rosters  the NHL also draws players from an expanding pool of other nations where organized and professional hockey is played  A steady stream of European players began entering the league in the 1970s  continuing into the 1980s  Most of the first wave of Europeans came from Sweden and Finland  with a small number of defectors from the Soviet Bloc  Since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc  political ideological restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have disappeared  leading to a large influx of players mostly from Czech Republic  Slovakia and Russia into the NHL  Swedes  Finns  and other Western Europeans  who were always free to move to North America  came to the league in greater numbers than before  Many of the league s top players today come from these European countries  including  Daniel Alfredsson  Erik Karlsson  Henrik Sedin  Daniel Sedin  Henrik Lundqvist  Jaromir Jagr  Patrik Elias  Teemu Selanne  Zdeno Chara  Pavel Datsyuk  Evgeni Malkin  and Alexander Ovechkin  European players were drafted and signed by NHL teams in an effort to bring in more  skilled offensive players   although recently there has been a decline in European players as more American players enter the league  The addition of European players changed the style of play in the NHL and European style hockey has been integrated into the NHL game  Conversely Canadian coaches and the Canadian style of play have been embraced by many European countries  Because of the continued success of Canadian teams in world tournaments many other countries are trying to model their development programs after Hockey Canada s   Since 1998  the league has voluntarily suspended its all star game and expanded the traditional all star break during Winter Olympic years to allow NHL players an opportunity to represent their respective countries  The 2010 Winter Olympics were held in Vancouver  an NHL city  Conversely  the IIHF World Championships are held at the same time as the Stanley Cup Playoffs  Thus  NHL players generally only join their respective country s team in the World Championships if their respective NHL team has been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention   The NHL has players from 18 different countries  with the majority  52 0 percent during the 2007–08 NHL season  coming from Canada  The following table shows the origins of every player  skaters and goaltenders  who played an NHL regular season game in the given year  The table follows the Hockey Hall of Fame convention of classifying players by the currently existing countries in which their birthplaces are located  without regard to their citizenship or where they were trained   12  Television and radio  12 1  Canada  Broadcasting rights in Canada have historically included the CBC s Hockey Night in Canada  HNIC   a long standing Canadian tradition dating to 1952  and even prior to that on radio since the 1920s  Other previous Canadian broadcasters have included CTV  Global  TSN  Sportsnet  and French language broadcasts on SRC  RDS and TVA Sports   The current national television and digital rightsholder is Rogers Communications  under a 12 year deal valued at C$5 2 billion which began in the 2014–15 season  and replaced both CBC and Bell Media as the national broadcast and cable television rightsholders respectively  National English language coverage of the NHL is carried primarily by Rogers  Sportsnet group of specialty channels  Sportsnet holds an exclusive window for games played on Wednesday nights  Hockey Night in Canada was maintained and expanded under the deal  airing up to seven games nationally on Saturday nights throughout the regular season across CBC  the Sportsnet networks  Rogers owned television network City  and FX Canada  While CBC maintains Rogers produced NHL coverage during the regular season and playoffs through a time brokerage agreement with the company  Rogers assumes editorial control and the ownership of any advertising revenue from the telecasts  City also airs a Sunday night game of the week  Rogers Hometown Hockey  which features a pre game show originating from various Canadian communities  Sportsnet s networks also air occasional games involving all U S  matchups   Under a sub licensing agreement with Rogers  Quebecor Media holds national French language rights to the NHL  with the majority of coverage airing on its specialty channel TVA Sports  and playoff coverage on TVA  TVA Sports  flagship broadcasts on Saturday nights focus primarily on the Montreal Canadiens   Games that are not broadcast as part of the national rights deal are

Edmonton Oilers  and Vancouver Canucks  while TSN holds rights to the Ottawa Senators  Winnipeg Jets  and Toronto Maple Leafs  split with Sportsnet   RDS holds regional French language rights to the Canadiens and Senators  Regional games are subject to blackout for viewers outside of each team s designated market   12 2  United States  Historically  the NHL has never fared well on American television in comparison to the other American professional leagues  The league s American broadcast partners have been in flux for decades  ranging from such networks as CBS  SportsChannel America  the USA Network  Fox  ABC  and ESPN   National U S  television rights are currently held by NBCUniversal  its current 10 year  US$2 billion contract  which began in the 2011 12 season  extended and unified rights deals that were first established in the 2005 06 season  when Comcast acquired cable rights to the league for Outdoor Life Network  later known as Versus   and NBC Sports acquired broadcast television rights to the league under a revenue sharing agreement  In January 2011  Comcast acquired NBC s parent company NBC Universal  and later negotiated a new 10 year deal with the NHL  worth nearly US$2 billion  Comcast also announced the re branding of Versus as the NBC Sports Network  NBCSN   Under this contract  NBCSN usually airs at least two regular season games per week  while NBC airs afternoon games on selected weekends  NBCUniversal holds exclusive rights to Wednesday night games  all games televised by the NBC network  and every game in the Stanley Cup Playoffs beginning in the second round  Coverage of the playoffs and the Finals is split between the two networks  with other games shown on CNBC and NHL Network   As in Canada  games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team s home market  and are subject to blackout outside of them  These broadcasters include regional sports network chains such as Comcast SportsNet  Fox Sports Networks  MSG Network  and Root Sports  Certain national telecasts on NBCSN  such as certain regular season games and first round playoff games  are non exclusive  and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters  However  national telecasts of these games are blacked out in the participating teams  markets to protect the local broadcaster   XM Satellite Radio is the official satellite radio broadcaster of the NHL  as of July 1  2007  Between September 2005 and June 2007  the NHL s broadcasting rights were shared with both XM and Sirius Satellite Radio and were broadcast on just Sirius before the NHL lockout  XM used to broadcast more than 80% of NHL games  including all the playoffs and finals  Starting with the 2007–08 season  XM broadcasts every game   12 3  NHL Network  The league co owns the NHL Network  a television specialty channel devoted to the NHL  There are two versions  one for Canadian viewers and a separate one for those in the United States  The NHL Network is a joint venture with other media companies  CTV Specialty Television and Insight Sports are both minority owners of the Canadian version  while NBCUniversal is a minority owner of the American version   The NHL Network s signature show is NHL Tonight  formerly NHL on the Fly   which covers NHL news  highlights  interviews  and analysis  The NHL Network also airs live games  with the Canadian version primarily focusing on those featuring Canadian teams and the American version focusing on American teams  These are usually simulcasts of one of the team s regional broadcaster  The American NHL Network may also simulcast a CBC game televised nationally in Canada  and the Canadian NHL network may also simulcast an NBC game televised nationally in the U S   12 4  Out of market sports packages  The NHL operates two subscription based services allowing access to live  out of market games  NHL Centre Ice in Canada and NHL Center Ice in the United States offer access to out of market feeds of games through a cable or satellite television provider   The league also offers NHL GameCenter Live  branded as Rogers NHL GameCentre Live in Canada   which allows the streaming of out of market games over the internet  either through the NHL website  smartphones and tablets  digital media players  smart TVs  and video game consoles  In market and nationally televised games are not available through either of these services   Per its exclusive national television and digital rights contract  Rogers Communications took over Canadian distribution and marketing of both the out of market TV and the internet services in Canada as of the 2014–15 season  A number of changes were made to the internet service  which was re branded as Rogers NHL GameCentre Live  it now offers access to nationally televised games  along with in market streaming of regional games for teams that Sportsnet holds broadcast rights to  as of the 2014–15 season  these include almost all NHL teams in Canada  aside from the Ottawa Senators and Winnipeg Jets  whose broadcast rights are held by TSN  As part of the transition  Rogers also issued a free trial of the service  lasting through the start of 2015  to all Rogers cable and mobile internet subscribers  The service offers  GamePlus   a component featuring alternate camera angles  such as net cams  point of view cams  and sky cams  The sky cam are currently only available for Air Canada Centre games  but the remaining Canadian arenas will be equipped for it in the future  GamePlus will only be available to GameCentre Live subscribers who are subscribed to Rogers  cable  internet  or wireless services   12 5  International  Outside of Canada and the United States  NHL games are broadcast across Europe  excluding the UK and Scandinavia  and the Middle East on ESPN America  which takes feeds from NBC  Rogers  and teams  regional broadcasts  In the UK Premier Sports has the rights to the NHL and show 15 games per week  Fox

in the UK where they are not allowed to show live games that are being shown on Premier Sports   13  Popularity  The NHL is considered one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America  along with Major League Baseball  the National Football League  and the National Basketball Association  The league is very prominent in Canada  where hockey is the most popular of these four major sports as alongside CFL  Overall  hockey has the smallest total fan base of the four leagues  the smallest revenue from television  and the least sponsorship   While the NHL does not hold one of the largest fan bases in North America  it does hold one of the most affluent fan bases  Studies by the Sports Marketing Group conducted from 1998 to 2004 show that the NHL s fan base is much more affluent than that of the PGA Tour  A study done by the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2004  found that NHL fans in America were the most educated and affluent of the four major leagues  They were also found to be substantially more computer literate than the other fans  Further it noted that season ticket sales were more prominent in the NHL than the other three because of the ability of the NHL fan to purchase them  something more out of reach for fans of the other leagues  According to Reuters in 2010  the largest demographic of NHL fans was highly sought after group males aged 18–34  who were also shown to be more  tech savvy  than most fans   The NHL estimates that fully half of its fan base roots for teams in outside markets  Beginning in 2008  under the direction of Chief Operating Officer John Collins  the NHL began a shift toward using digital technology to market to fans to capitalize on this   The debut of the Winter Classic  an outdoor regular season NHL game held on New Year s Day 2008  was a major success for the league  The game has since become a permanent staple of the NHL schedule  This  along with the transition to a national  Game of the Week  and an annual  Hockey Day in America  regional coverage  all televised on NBC  has helped increase the NHL s regular season television viewership in the United States  These improvements led NBC and the cable channel Versus to sign a shared ten year broadcast deal  as their parent companies were merging   paying US$200 million per year for both American cable and broadcast rights  the deal will lead to further increases in television coverage on the NBC channels   This has boosted viewership metrics for the NHL  The 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs saw the largest audience in the history of the sport  after a regular season that saw record breaking business success  propelled in large part by the NHL s strategy of engaging fans through big events and robust digital offerings   This success has resulted in a 66 percent rise in NHL advertising and sponsorship revenue  Collins said  It was a great Stanley Cup run  really across every possible metric      Our fans are consuming more hockey   Merchandise sales were up 22 percent and the number of unique visitors on the NHL com website were up 17 percent during the playoffs after rising 29 percent in the regular season   14  Charitable causes  The NHL advocates for a number of causes throughout the season  During the days leading up to Remembrance Day  November 11  known as Veterans Day in the United States   in respect of the day  coaches and other NHL officials wear red poppy lapel pins  Hockey Fights Cancer is a joint initiative founded in December 1998 by the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players  Association to raise money and awareness for hockey s most important fight  It is supported by NHL Member Clubs  NHL Alumni  the NHL Officials  Association  Professional Hockey Trainers and Equipment Managers  corporate marketing partners  broadcast partners and fans   15  See also  List of American and Canadian cities by number of major professional sports franchises  List of NHL records
