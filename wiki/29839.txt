Television is an American rock band  formed in New York City in 1973 and considered influential in the development of punk music   Television was part of the 1970s New York rock scene along with musical acts like the Patti Smith Group  the Ramones  Blondie  Richard Hell and Talking Heads  Although they recorded in a raw manner similar to their contemporaries  minimizing the use of studio techniques  sound effects and atypical instruments  Television s music was technically proficient  defined by guitarists Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd  The group s debut album  Marquee Moon  is often considered one of the defining releases of the punk era   1  History  1 1  Early history and formation  Television s roots can be traced to the teenage friendship between Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell  The duo met at Sanford School in Hockessin  Delaware  from which they ran away  Both moved to New York  separately  in the early 1970s  aspiring to be poets   Their first group together was the Neon Boys  consisting of Verlaine on guitar and vocals  Hell on bass and vocals and Billy Ficca on drums  The group lasted from late 1972 to late 1973  A 7 inch record featuring  That s All I Know  Right Now   and  Love Comes in Spurts  was released in 1980   In late 1973 the group reformed  calling themselves Television and recruiting Richard Lloyd as a second guitarist  Their first gig was at the Townhouse Theatre  on March 2  1974  They soon persuaded CBGB owner Hilly Kristal to give the band a regular gig at his club  where they reportedly constructed their first stage  After playing several gigs at CBGB in early 1974  they played at Max s Kansas City and other clubs  returning to CBGB in January 1975  where they established a significant cult following   1 2  Departure of Richard Hell and debut release  Initially  songwriting was split almost evenly between Hell and Verlaine  Lloyd being an infrequent contributor as well  However  friction began to develop as Verlaine  Lloyd and Ficca became increasingly confident and adept with both instruments and composition  while Hell remained defiantly untrained in his approach  Verlaine  feeling that Hell s frenzied onstage demeanor was upstaging his songs  reportedly told him to  stop jumping around  during the songs and occasionally refused to play Hell s songs  such as  Blank Generation   in concert  This conflict  as well as one of their songs being picked up by Island Records  led Hell to leave the group and take some of his songs with him  He co founded The Heartbreakers in 1975 with former members of the New York Dolls Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan  later forming Richard Hell and the Voidoids  Fred Smith  briefly of Blondie  replaced Hell as Television s bassist   Television made their vinyl debut with  Little Johnny Jewel   a 7 inch single on the independent label Ork Records in 1975  Ork Records was owned by their manager  Terry Ork  The song was split into two parts  one on each side of the single  Richard Lloyd apparently disagreed with the selection of this song  preferring  O Mi Amore  for their debut  to the extent that he seriously considered leaving the band  Reportedly Pere Ubu guitarist Peter Laughner auditioned for his spot during this time   1 3  Marquee Moon  Adventure and break up  1977–78   Television s first album  Marquee Moon  was received positively by music critics and audiences and entered the Billboard 200 albums chart – it also sold well in Europe and reached the Top 30 in many countries there  Upon its initial release in 1977  Roy Trakin wrote in the SoHo Weekly  forget everything you ve heard about Television  forget punk  forget New York  forget CBGB s     hell  forget rock and roll—this is the real item   Critics have since ranked the album number 83 on cable music channel VH1 s 2000 list of the 100 Greatest Albums of Rock and Roll and number 128 on Rolling Stones 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time  It was ranked number two in Uncut magazine s  100 Greatest Debut Records  and number 3 on Pitchfork Media s list of the best albums of the 1970s  Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes that the album was  revolutionary  and composed  entirely of tense garage rockers that spiral into heady intellectual territory  which is achieved through the group s long  interweaving instrumental sections    Television s second album  Adventure  was issued in 1978   The band members  independent and strongly held artistic visions  along with Richard Lloyd s drug abuse  led to the band s break up in 1978  Both Lloyd and Verlaine pursued solo careers   1 4  Reformation  1992–present   Television reformed in 1992  released an eponymous third album and have performed live sporadically thereafter  Since being wooed back on stage together for the 2001 All Tomorrow s Parties festival at Camber Sands  England  they ve played a number of dates around the world and continue to perform on an irregular basis   In 2007  Richard Lloyd announced he would be amicably leaving the band after a midsummer show in New York City s Central Park  Due to an extended hospital stay recovering from pneumonia  he was unable to make the Central Park concert  Jimmy Rip substituted for him that day  and was subsequently asked to join the band full time in Lloyd s place  On July 7  2011  the new lineup performed at the Beco 203 music festival in São Paulo  Brazil  In an MTV Brazil Television interview  the band confirmed that an album with about ten new tracks was close to being finished   2  Musical style and influences  As with many emerging punk bands  the influence of The Velvet Underground was pervasive  Television also drew inspiration from minimalist composers such as Steve Reich  Tom Verlaine has often cited the influence of surf bands The Ventures and Dick Dale to Television s approach to the guitar  and he has also expressed a fondness for the bands Love and Buffalo Springfield  two groups noted for their dual guitar interplay  Television s ties to punk were underscored by their late  60s garage rock leanings  as the band often covered the Count Five s  Psychotic Reaction  and The 13th Floor Elevators   Fire Engine  in concert   Lester Bangs heard in Television s music the influence of Quicksilver Messenger Service  noting a similarity between Verlaine s guitar playing and that of John Cipollina  Tom Verlaine has downplayed the comparison  citing The Ventures as a more apt reference point   Though Verlaine and Lloyd were nominally  rhythm  and  lead  guitarists  they often rendered such labels obsolete by crafting interlocking parts  where the ostensible rhythm role could be as intriguing as the lead  Al Handa writes   In Television s case  Lloyd was the guitarist who affected the tonality of the music more often than not  and Verlaine and the rhythm section the ones who gave the ear its anchor and familiar musical elements  Listen only to Lloyd  and you can hear some truly off the wall ideas being played   The opening of the song  Marquee Moon  from the album of the same name displays the band s characteristic interlocking melodic and rhythmic guitar lines   3  Members    Current
