1943  He is the eldest of 3  of an accountant father and housewife mother  He grew up in New Jersey  Farrell attended high school at the American School of The Hague in his Freshman and Sophomore years  then graduated from Midland Park High School in New Jersey in 1961  where he was student body president  He was chosen by the Veterans of Foreign Wars as his town s  Waldwick s  selection for New Jersey Boys  State   Warren Farrell received a B A  from Montclair State University in social sciences in 1965  As a college student  Farrell was a national vice president of the Student National Education Association  leading President Lyndon B  Johnson to invite him to the White House Conference on Education   In 1966 he received an M A  from UCLA in political science and in 1974 a Ph D  in the same discipline from New York University  While completing his Ph D  at NYU  he served as an assistant to the president of New York University   2  University teaching  Farrell has taught university level courses in five disciplines  psychology  women s studies  sociology  political science  gender and parenting issues   These were at the School of Medicine at the University of California  San Diego  the California School of Professional Psychology  in the Department of Women’s Studies at San Diego State  at Brooklyn College  Georgetown University  American University  and Rutgers   3  Feminist Foundation  When the second wave of the women’s movement evolved in the late 1960s  Farrell’s support of it led the National Organization for Women’s New York City chapter to ask him to form a men’s group  The response to that group led to his ultimately forming some 300 additional men and women s groups and becoming the only man to be elected three times to the Board of Directors of the National Organization for Women in N Y C   1971–74   In 1974  Farrell left N O W  in N Y C  and his teaching at Rutgers when his wife became a White House Fellow and he moved with her to D C  They subsequently divorced   During his feminist period  Farrell wrote op eds for the New York Times and appeared frequently on the Today show and Phil Donahue show  and was featured in People  Parade and the international media  This  and his women and men’s groups  one of which had been joined by John Lennon  inspired The Liberated Man  The Liberated Man was written from a feminist perspective  introducing alternative family and work arrangements that could better accommodate working women and encourage care giving men  The Liberated Man was the beginning of Farrell s development of parallels for men to the female experience  for example  to women s experience as  sex objects   Farrell labeled men s parallel experience as  success objects    As a speaker  Farrell was known for creating audience participation role reversal experiences to get both sexes  to walk a mile in the other s moccasins   The most publicized were his  men s beauty contest  and  role reversal date   In the men s beauty contest  all the men are invited to experience  the beauty contest of everyday life that no woman can escape   In the  role reversal date  every woman was encouraged to  risk a few of the 150 risks of rejection men typically experience between eye contact and intercourse    4  Integrating men s issues into gender issues  In a 1997 interview  Farrell stated   4 1  Why Men Are The Way They Are  Farrell s books each contain personal introductions that describe his perspective on aspects of public consciousness and his own personal development led to the book  By the mid 1980s  Farrell was writing that both the role reversal exercises and the women and men’s groups allowed him to hear women’s increasing anger toward men  and also learn about men’s feelings of being misrepresented  He wrote Why Men Are The Way They Are to answer women’s questions about men in a way he hoped rang true for the men   He distinguished between what he believed to be each sex s primary fantasies and primary needs  stating that  both sexes fell in love with members of the other sex who are the least capable of loving  women with men who are successful  men with women who are young and beautiful   He asserts that women feel disappointed because   the qualities it takes to be successful at work are often in tension with the qualities it takes to be successful in love   Similarly he asserts that men feel disappointed because   a young and beautiful woman   genetic celebrity   often learns more about receiving  not giving  while older and less attractive women often learn more about giving and doing for others  which is more compatible with love   Due partially to Oprah Winfrey’s support  Why Men Are the Way They Are became his best selling book   4 2  The Myth of Male Power  By the early 1990s  Farrell was writing that he felt the misunderstandings about men had deepened and become dangerous to the survival of families and love  The result was The Myth of Male Power   In The Myth of Male Power  Farrell offered his first in depth outline of the thesis he would weave through his subsequent books  that for men and women to make an evolutionary shift from a focus on survival to a focus on a balance between survival and fulfillment  what was ultimately necessary was neither a women s movement nor a men s movement  but a  gender transition movement   He defined a gender transition movement as one that fosters a transition from the rigid roles of our past to more flexible roles for the future   As the book s title implied  The Myth of Male Power challenged the belief that men had the power—in part by challenging the definition of power  Farrell defined power as  control over one s life   He wrote that   In the past  neither sex had power  both sexes had roles  women s role was to raise children  men s role was to raise money    Farrell documented how  cross culturally  men s feelings of powerlessness involved how they felt they were socialized  even as boys  to become  the disposable sex   He argued that virtually every society that survived did so by training a cadre of its sons to be disposable—in war  and in work  The paradox of masculinity  he proposed  is that the very training for traditional masculinity that created a healthy society created unhealthy boys and men   The Myth of Male Power was ardently challenged by some academic feminists  whose critique is that men earn more money  and that money is power  Farrell concurs that men earn more money  and that money is one form of power  However  Farrell also adds that  men often feel obligated to earn money someone else spends while they die sooner  and feeling obligated is not power   This perspective was to be more fully developed in Farrell s Why Men Earn More   Farrell says heterosexual men are conditioned to believe that they can obtain love and affection from women only by earning money  This belief in turn leads to psychological problems for both sexes  according to Farrell   men s weakness is their facade of strength  women s strength is their facade of weakness    Perhaps Farrell s most controversial contribution to gender politics is The Myth of Male Power s directly challenging the belief that patriarchal societies make rules to benefit men at the expense of women  Farrell argues that this oversimplification misses many realities—such as the facts that only American men  and not women are required to register for military conscription  or the fact that men constitute 93% of workplace deaths   Analyses such as these led The Myth of Male Power to become both his most praised and most controversial book  In the discipline of men s studies  it is considered to be a classic  In the new academic journal  New Male Studies  An International Journal  in depth interviews with Dr  Farrell focusing on The Myth of Male Power are the main features of two issues in 2012  This book  however  led to Susan Faludi writing in Backlash that Farrell had recanted his original feminist position   4 3  Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say and Father and Child Reunion  The increase in divorces in the 1980s and 1990s turned Farrell’s writing toward two issues  the poverty of couples’ communication  and children’s loss of their father in child custody cases   In Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say  Farrell asserts that couples often fail to use couples  communication outside of counseling if the person receiving criticism does not know how to make her or himself feel safe  Farrell develops a method called “Cinematic Immersion” to create that safety and overcome what he posits is humans  biological propensity to respond defensively to personal criticism   To address children’s loss of their father in child custody cases  Farrell wrote Father and Child Reunion  a meta analysis of research about what is the optimal family arrangement for children of divorce  Father and Child Reunion s findings include some 26 ways in which children of divorce do better when three conditions prevail  equally shared parenting  or joint custody   close parental proximity  and no bad mouthing  His research for Father and Child Reunion provided the basis for his frequently appearing in the first decade of the 21st Century as an expert witness in child custody cases on the balance between mothers  and fathers  rights needed to create the optimal family arrangement for children of divorce   4 4  Why Men Earn More  By the start of the 21st century  Farrell felt he had re examined every substantial adult male female issue except the pay gap  i e   that men as a group tend to earn more money than women as a group   In Why Men Earn More  The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap—and What Women Can Do About It  he documents 25 differences in men and women’s work life choices which  he argues  account for most or all of the pay gap more accurately than did claims of widespread discrimination against women  Common to each of men’s choices was earning more money  while each of women’s choices prioritized having a more balanced life  These 25 differences allowed Farrell to offer women 25 ways to higher pay—and accompany each with their possible trade offs  The trade offs include working more hours and for more years  taking technical or more hazardous jobs  relocating overseas or traveling overnight  This led to considerable praise for Why Men Earn More as a career book for women   Some of Farrell s findings in Why Men Earn More  included his analysis of census bureau data that never married women without children earn 13% more than their male counterparts  or that the gender pay gap is largely about married men with children who earn more due to their assuming more workplace obligations  Themes woven throughout Why Men Earn More are the importance of assessing trade offs  that  the road to high pay is a toll road   the  Pay Paradox   that  pay is about the power we forfeit to get the power of pay    and  since men earn more  and women have more balanced lives  that men have more to learn from women than women do from men   4 5  Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men   Farrell’s most recent book  Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men   ISBN 978 0195312836   published by Oxford University Press in 2008  is a debate book with feminist co author James Sterba  Farrell felt gender studies in universities rarely incorporated the masculine gender except to demonize it  This book was Farrell’s attempt to test whether a positive perspective about men would be allowed to be incorporated into universities  gender studies curriculum even if there were a feminist rebuttal  Farrell and Sterba debated 13 topics  from children s and fathers  rights  to the  Boy Crisis    5  Critical reception  Warren Farrell’s books  published in sixteen languages  tend to make both international news and be the subject of both praise and criticism from the political right and left  and from feminists and anti feminists  The Myth of Male Power is both the most praised and criticized  For example  in 2012  when speaking on his forthcoming The Boy Crisis at the University of Toronto  Farrell encountered a protest organized by Socialist Worker Party feminists calling him a  rape apologist   This was said to be based on his chapter on  The Politics of Rape  in The Myth of Male Power  Farrell maintains the chapter is a blueprint for preventing rape   Early critiques in the New York Times Book Review by Larry McMurtry and John Leonard included disdain for Farrell’s use of gender neutral language in The Liberated Man  More recently  conservative and antifeminist Phyllis Schlafly labels Farrell a “feminist apologist ” though praises his research for Father and Child Reunion   Praise of Warren Farrell include Kate Zernike of The Boston Globe ranking him as  the sage of the men s movement   and the description of him as the  Gloria Steinem of men s liberation  by Carol Kleiman of the Chicago Tribune  Esquire ranked Farrell  Thomas Aquinas  and John Stuart Mill as three of history s leading male feminists   In 2012  a new international academic journal  New Male Studies  highlighted The Myth of Male Power by making it the lead feature in two of its first issues  positioning it as a classic to the field of men’s studies   Farrell s recent collaborations with Ken Wilber  John Gray  and Richard Bolles  have introduced his messages to more diverse and receptive audiences  Farrell s claims on gender relations have attracted the interest of English academic Rory Ridley Duff  who has integrated Farrell s perspectives into curriculum materials  academic papers and a book and developed Attraction Theory to capture the gendering dynamics implicit in Farrell s work   6  Personal life  Farrell married Ursula  a mathematician and IBM executive  in the sixties  After 10 years of marriage  in 1976 they separated and they subsequently divorced  After what Farrell described as  twenty years of adventuresome single hood   he married Liz Dowling in August 2002  He has two step daughters  They live in Mill Valley  California   7  Other activities  During the California gubernatorial recall election  Farrell ran as a Democratic candidate  on a platform of father s rights  and received 626 votes  Farrell’s current foci are conducting communication workshops  being an expert witness in child custody cases  and researching a forthcoming book  working title Boys to Men   to be co authored with John Gray  In 2010 11  he keynoted  along with Deepak Chopra  a world conference on spirituality  the Integral Spiritual Experience   addressing the evolution of love  He was then invited by the Center on World Spirituality to be one of their world leaders  Dr  Farrell is also now a semi regular contributor to controversial web publication A Voice for Men  and at their international conference in June 2014  gave a keynote titled   The Ten Major Boys and Men s Issues    In 2009  a call from the White House requesting Dr  Farrell to be an advisor to the White House Council on Women and Girls led to Dr  Farrell creating and chairing a commission to create a White House Council on Boys and Men  The multi partisan commission consists of thirty five authors and practitioners  e g   John Gray  Gov  Jennifer Granholm  Michael Gurian  Michael Thompson  Bill Pollack  Leonard Sax  of boys  and men s issues  They have completed a study that defines five components to a  boys  crisis   which has been submitted as a proposal for President Obama to create a White House Council on Boys and Men   8  Bibliography  9  References  10  External links  Article from Salon com
