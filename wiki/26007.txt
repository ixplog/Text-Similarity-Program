Mass racial violence in the United States  also called race riots  can include such disparate events as   attacks on Irish Catholics  the Chinese and other immigrants in the 19th century   attacks on Native Americans and Americans over the land   attacks on Italian immigrants in the early 20th century  and Mexicans and Puerto Ricans in the later 20th century   attacks on African Americans that occurred  as in 1919  in addition to the lynchings in the period after Reconstruction through the first half of the 20th century   frequent fighting among various ethnic groups in major cities  specifically in the northeast and midwest United States throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century  This example was made famous in the stage musical West Side Story and its film adaptation   unrest in African American communities  such as the 1968 riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King  Jr    1  Anti immigrant and anti Catholic violence  Riots defined by  race  have taken place between ethnic groups in the United States since as early as the pre Revolution era of the 18th century  During the early to mid  19th centuries  violent rioting occurred between Protestant  Nativists  and recently arrived Irish Catholic immigrants  These reached heights during the peak of immigration in the 1840s and 1850s in cities including New York  Philadelphia  and Boston  During the early 20th century  riots were common against Irish and French Canadian immigrants in Providence  Rhode Island   The San Francisco Vigilance Movements of 1851 and 1856 are often described by sympathetic historians as responses to rampant crime and government corruption  But  recent historians have noted that the vigilantes had a nativist bias  they systematically attacked first Irish immigrants  and later Mexicans  Chileans who came as miners during the California Gold Rush  and Chinese immigrants  During the early 20th century  racial or ethnic violence was directed by whites against Filipinos  Japanese and Armenians in California  who had arrived in waves of immigration   During the late 19th century and early 20th century  Italian Americans were subject to racial violence  In 1891  eleven Italians were violently murdered in the streets by a large lynch mob  In the 1890s a total of twenty Italians were lynched in the South  Anti Polish violence also occurred in the same time period   2  Nineteenth century events  Like lynchings  race riots often had their roots in economic tensions or in white defense of the color line   In 1887  for example  ten thousand workers at sugar plantations in Louisiana  organized by the Knights of Labor  went on strike for an increase in their pay to $1 25 a day  Most of the workers were black  but some were white  infuriating Governor Samuel Douglas McEnery  who declared that  God Almighty has himself drawn the color line   The militia was called in  but withdrawn to give free rein to a lynch mob in Thibodaux  The mob killed between 20 and 300 blacks  A black newspaper described the scene   In 1891  a mob lynched Joe Coe  a black worker in Omaha  Nebraska suspected of attacking a young white woman from South Omaha  Approximately 10 000 white people  mostly ethnic immigrants from South Omaha  reportedly swarmed the courthouse and took Coe from his jail cell  beating and then lynching him  Reportedly 6 000 people visited Coe s corpse during a public exhibition at which pieces of the lynching rope were sold as souvenirs  This was a period when even officially sanctioned executions  such as hangings  were regularly conducted in public   3  Twentieth century events  Labor and immigrant conflict was a source of tensions that catalyzed into the East St  Louis riot of 1917  White rioters  many of them ethnic immigrants  killed an estimated 100 black residents of East St  Louis  after black residents had killed two white policemen  mistaking the car they were riding in for a previous car of white occupants who drove through a black neighborhood and fired randomly into a crowd of blacks  White on Black race riots include the Atlanta riots  1906   the Omaha and Chicago riots  1919   part of a series of riots in the volatile post World War I environment  and the Tulsa Riots  1921    The Chicago race riot of 1919 grew out of tensions on the Southside  where Irish descendants and African Americans competed for jobs at the stockyards  and where both were crowded into substandard housing  The Irish descendants had been in the city longer  and were organized around athletic and political clubs   A young black Chicagoan  Eugene Williams  paddled a raft near a Southside Lake Michigan beach into  white territory   and drowned after being hit by a rock thrown by a young white man  Witnesses pointed out the killer to a policeman  who refused to make an arrest  An indignant black mob attacked the officer  Violence broke out across the city  White mobs  many of them organized around Irish athletic clubs  began pulling black people off trolley cars  attacking black businesses  and beating victims with baseball bats and iron bars  Black people surprised them by fighting back  Having learned from the East St  Louis riot  the city closed down the street car system  but the rioting continued  A total of 23 blacks and 15 whites were killed   The 1921 Tulsa race riot grew out of economic competition  as the black Greenwood area was compared to Wall Street  and filled with independent businesses  In the immediate event  blacks resisted whites who tried to lynch 19 year old Dick Rowland  who worked at shoeshines  Thirty nine people  26 black  13 white  were confirmed killed  An early 21st century investigation of these events has suggested that the number of casualties could be much higher  White mobs set fire to the black Greenwood district  destroying 1 256 homes and as many as 200 businesses  Fires leveled 35 blocks of residential and commercial neighborhood  Black people were rounded up by the Oklahoma National Guard and put into several internment centers  including a baseball stadium  White rioters in airplanes shot at black refugees and dropped improvised kerosene bombs and dynamite on them   By the 1960s  decades of racial  economic  and political forces  which generated inner city poverty  resulted in  race riots  within minority areas in cities across the United States  The beating and rumored death of cab driver John Smith by police  sparked the 1967 Newark riots  This event became  per capita  one of the deadliest civil disturbances of the 1960s  The long and short term causes of the Newark riots are explored in depth in the documentary film Revolution  67  The assassinations of Rev  Martin Luther King  Jr  in Memphis  Tennessee and later of Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles in 1968 also led to rioting   4  Timeline of events  4 1  Nativist period 1700s–1860  1829  Cincinnati riot of 1829  Cincinnati  Ohio   1829  Charlestown
