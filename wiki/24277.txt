Paul Bunyan is a giant lumberjack in American folklore  His exploits revolve around the tall tales of his superhuman labors  and he is customarily accompanied by Babe the Blue Ox  The character originated in the oral tradition of North American loggers and was later popularized by freelance writer William B  Laughead  1882–1958  in a 1916 promotional pamphlet for the Red River Lumber Company  He has been the subject of various literary compositions  musical pieces  commercial works  and theatrical productions  His likeness is displayed in several oversized statues across North America   1  Etymology  There are many hypotheses about the etymology of the name Paul Bunyan  Much of the commentary focuses on a Franco Canadian origin for the name  Phonetically Bunyan is similar to the Québécois expression  bon yenne   expressing surprise or astonishment  The English surname Bunyan derives from the same root as bunion in the Old French bugne  referring to a large lump or swelling  Several researchers have attempted to trace Paul Bunyan to the character of Bon Jean or Tit Jean of French Canadian folklore   2  Early references  According to Michael Edmonds in his book  Out of the Northwoods  The Many Lives of Paul Bunyan  Paul Bunyan stories circulated for at least thirty years before finding their way into print  In contrast to the lengthy narratives abundant in published material  Paul Bunyan  stories  when told in the lumbercamp bunkhouses were presented in short fragments  Some of these stories include motifs from older folktales  such as absurdly severe weather and fearsome critters  Parallels in early printings support the view that at least a handful of Bunyan stories hold a common origin in folklore  The earliest recorded reference of Paul Bunyan is an uncredited 1904 editorial in the Duluth News Tribune which recounts   Each of these elements  logging the Dakotas  a giant camp  the winter of the blue snow  and stove skating  recurs in later accounts  All four anecdotes are mirrored in J E  Rockwell s  Some Lumberjack Myths  six years later  and James MacGillivray wrote on the subject of stove skating in  Round River  four years before that  MacGillivray s account  somewhat extended  would reappear in The American Lumberman in 1910  The American Lumberman would follow up with a few  sporadic editorials such as  Paul Bunyan s Oxen    In Paul Bunyan s Cook Shanty   and  Chronicle of Life and Works of Mr  Paul Bunyan   But it was Rockwell s earlier story that was one of the few to allude to Paul Bunyan s Goliath like stature and introduce his big  blue ox  prior to Laughead s commercialization of Paul Bunyan  although W D  Harrigan did refer to a giant  albeit  pink ox in  Paul Bunyan s Oxen   circa 1914  In all the articles Paul Bunyan is praised as a logger of great physical strength and unrivaled skill   3  In advertising and promotion  William B  Laughead  an independent adman  was the first to utilize Paul Bunyan for commercial use  In a series of campaigns for the Red River Lumber Company  his first endeavor  a pamphlet entitled   Introducing Mr  Paul Bunyan of Westwood  California   produced little to be desired  It was not until  Tales about Paul Bunyan  Vol  II  appeared that the campaign gained momentum  Embellishing older exploits and adding some of his own  Laughead s revamped Paul Bunyan did not stay faithful to the original folktales  Among other things  Laughead gave the name  Babe  to the blue ox  increased Paul Bunyan s height to impossible proportions  and created the first pictorial representation of Bunyan  This has led to significant confusion regarding the validity of Paul Bunyan as a genuine folkloric character  Nevertheless  the Laughead pamphlets are regarded as one of the most popular collections  often appearing in a single  unabridged volume entitled  The Marvelous Exploits of Paul Bunyan  The Red River ad campaign not only engrained Paul Bunyan as a nationally recognized figure  but affirmed his massive marketing appeal  Throughout the better part of the century Paul Bunyan s name and image continued to be utilized in promoting various products  cities  and services  Across North America  giant statues of Paul Bunyan were erected to promote local businesses and tourism  A significant portion of these were produced from the 1960s thru the 1970s by the company International Fiberglass as part of their  Muffler Men  series of giant  fiberglass sculptures   4  Scholarly research  Contemporaneously with Laughead  K  Bernice Stewart  a student at the University of Wisconsin  was working to gather Paul Bunyan stories from woodsmen in the Midwest  Through a series of interviews Stewart was able to make a scholarly anthology of original anecdotes  These were published as  Legends of Paul Bunyan  Lumberjack  in Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences  Arts and Letters and coauthored by her English professor  Homer A  Watt  The research relates traditional narratives  some in multiple versions  and goes on to conclude that many probably existed in some part before they were set to revolve around Bunyan as a central character  Stewart argued in her analysis that Paul Bunyan belongs to a class of traveler s tales  Charles E  Brown  curator of the Museum of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin and secretary of the Wisconsin Archaeological Society  was another principal researcher who recorded early Paul Bunyan stories from lumberjacks  He published these anecdotes in short pamphlet format for the use of students of folklore  Much of his research was financed through the government funded Wisconsin Writers  Program   In 2007 Michael Edmonds  of the Wisconsin Historical Society  began a thorough reinvestigation into the Paul Bunyan tradition  Publishing his findings in Out of the Northwoods  The Many Lives of Paul Bunyan  Edmonds concluded that Paul Bunyan had origins in the oral traditions of woodsmen working in Wisconsin camps during the turn of the 20th century  but such stories were heavily embellished and popularized by commercial interests   5  Children s adaptations  Running at variance to his origins in folklore  the character of Paul Bunyan has become a fixture for juvenile audiences since his debut in print  Typical among such adaptations is the further embellishment of stories pulled directly from William B  Laughead s pamphlet  and with very few elements from oral tradition adapted into them  Nearly all of the literature is presented in long narrative format  exaggerates Paul Bunyan s height to colossal proportions  and follows him from infancy to adulthood  Some of the more enduring collections of stories include Paul Bunyan by James Stevens  Paul Bunyan Swings His Axe by Dell J  McCormick  Paul Bunyan by Esther Shephard  Paul Bunyan and His Great Blue Ox by Wallace Wadsworth  and The Marvelous Exploits of Paul Bunyan by William Laughead  In 1958 Walt Disney Studios produced Paul Bunyan as an animated short musical  The feature starred Thurl Ravenscroft  perhaps best known as the voice of Tony the Tiger for the Kellogg Company  and was nominated for Best Animated Short by the Academy Awards   6  Debated authenticity  Some commentators  such as Carleton C  Ames  Marshall Fitwick  and particularly Richard Dorson  cite Paul Bunyan as an example of  fakelore   a literary invention passed off as an older folktale  They point out that the majority of books about Paul Bunyan  especially those targeted to juvenile audiences  are composed almost entirely of elements with no basis in folklore  However  while modern commercial writers are credited with setting Paul Bunyan on his rise to a nationally recognized figure  this ignores the historical roots of the character in logging camps and forest industries   At the same time  several authors have come forward to propose alternative origins for Paul Bunyan  D  Laurence Rogers and others have suggested a possible connection between Paul Bunyan tales and the exploits of French Canadian lumberjack  1845 – 1875   From 1865 to 1875 Fournier worked for the H  M  Loud Company in the Grayling  Michigan area  Another unverified claim  that Paul Bunyan was a soldier in the Papineau Rebellion named Paul Bon Jean  is first presented in writer James Stevens s 1925 book  Paul Bunyan  and occasionally repeated in other accounts  To the right is a comparison chart between early Paul Bunyan references  the Stewart and Watt paper  and the Laughead advertisement   7  See also  John
