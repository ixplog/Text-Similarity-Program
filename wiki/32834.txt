Varicose veins are veins that have become enlarged and twisted  The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg  although varicose veins can occur elsewhere  Veins have pairs of leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards  retrograde flow or venous reflux   Leg muscles pump the veins to return blood to the heart  the skeletal muscle pump   against the effects of gravity  When veins become varicose  the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly  and the valves do not work  valvular incompetence   This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more  Varicose veins are most common in the superficial veins of the legs  which are subject to high pressure when standing  Besides being a cosmetic problem  varicose veins can be painful  especially when standing  Severe long standing varicose veins can lead to leg swelling  venous eczema  skin thickening  lipodermatosclerosis  and ulceration  Life threatening complications are uncommon  but varicose veins may be confused with deep vein thrombosis  which may be life threatening   Non surgical treatments include sclerotherapy  elastic stockings  elevating the legs  and exercise  The traditional surgical treatment has been vein stripping to remove the affected veins  Newer  less invasive treatments which seal the main leaking vein are available  Alternative techniques  such as ultrasound guided foam sclerotherapy  radiofrequency ablation and endovenous laser treatment  are available as well  Because most of the blood in the legs is returned by the deep veins  the superficial veins  which return only about 10% of the total blood of the legs  can usually be removed or ablated without serious harm   Secondary varicose veins are those developing as collateral pathways  typically after stenosis or occlusion of the deep veins  a common sequel of extensive deep venous thrombosis  DVT   Treatment options are usually support stockings  occasionally sclerotherapy  and rarely limited surgery   Varicose veins are distinguished from reticular veins  blue veins  and telangiectasias  spider veins   which also involve valvular insufficiency  by the size and location of the veins  Many patients who suffer with varicose veins seek out the assistance of physicians who specialize in vein care or peripheral vascular disease  These physicians include vascular surgeons  phlebologists or interventional radiologists   1  Signs and symptoms  Aching  heavy legs  often worse at night and after exercise    Appearance of spider veins  telangiectasia  in the affected leg   Ankle swelling  especially in evening   A brownish yellow shiny skin discoloration near the affected veins   Redness  dryness  and itchiness of areas of skin  termed stasis dermatitis or venous eczema  because of waste products building up in the leg   Cramps may develop especially when making a sudden move as standing up   Minor injuries to the area may bleed more than normal or take a long time to heal   In some people the skin above the ankle may shrink  lipodermatosclerosis  because the fat underneath the skin becomes hard   Restless legs syndrome appears to be a common overlapping clinical syndrome in patients with varicose veins and other chronic venous insufficiency   Whitened  irregular scar like patches can appear at the ankles  This is known as atrophie blanche   1 1  Complications  Most varicose veins are reasonably benign  but severe varicosities can lead to major complications  due to the poor circulation through the affected limb   Pain  tenderness  heaviness  inability to walk or stand for long hours  thus hindering work  Skin conditions   Dermatitis which could predispose skin loss  Skin ulcers especially near the ankle  usually referred to as venous ulcers   Development of carcinoma or sarcoma in longstanding venous ulcers  There have been over 100 reported cases of malignant transformation and the rate is reported as 0 4% to 1%   Severe bleeding from minor trauma  of particular concern in the elderly   Blood clotting within affected veins  Termed superficial thrombophlebitis  These are frequently isolated to the superficial veins  but can extend into deep veins becoming a more serious problem   Acute fat necrosis can occur  especially at the ankle of overweight patients with varicose veins  Females are more frequently affected than males   2  Diagnosis  2 1  Clinical tests  Clinical tests that may be used include   Trendelenburg test  Fegan s test  Perthe s test  Multiple tornique test However it should be noted that since the advent of Lower limbs venous ultrasonography  these tests are of limited or no value   2 2  Investigations  Traditionally  varicose veins were only investigated using imaging techniques if there was a clinical suspicion of deep venous insufficiency  if they were recurrent  or if they involved the sapheno popliteal junction  This practice is not now widely accepted  All patients with varicose veins should now be investigated using Duplex doppler ultrasound scanning  The results from a randomised controlled trial  RCT  on the follow up of patients with and without routine Duplex scan has shown a significant difference in recurrence rate and reoperation rate at 2 and 7 years of follow up   2 3  Stages  C0 no visible or palpable signs of venous disease  C1 telangectasia or reticular veins  C2 varicose veins  sub divided into C2A   Varicose veins with no symptoms i e   asymptomatic  C2S   Varicose veins with symptoms   C3 edema  C4a skin changes due to venous disorders  pigmentation  eczema  C4b skin changes due to venous disorders  lipodermatosclerosis  atrophie blanche  C5 as C4 but with healed ulcers  C6 skin changes with active ulcers  venous insufficiency ulceration   3  Causes  Varicose veins are more common in women than in men  and are linked with heredity  Other related factors are pregnancy  obesity  menopause  aging  prolonged standing  leg injury  and abdominal straining  Varicose veins are unlikely to be caused by crossing the legs or ankles  Less commonly  but not exceptionally  varicose veins can be due to other causes  as post phlebitic obstruction or incontinence  venous and arteriovenous malformations  More recent research has shown the importance of pelvic vein reflux  PVR  in the development of varicose veins  John Hobbs showed varicose veins in the legs could be due to ovarian vein reflux and John Lumley and his team showed recurrent varicose veins could be due to ovarian vein reflux  Mark Whiteley and his team reported that both ovarian and internal iliac vein reflux causes leg varicose veins and that this condition affects 14% of women with varicose veins or 20% of women who have had vaginal delivery and have leg varicose veins  In addition there is evidence that failing to look for  and treat  pelvic vein reflux can be a cause of recurrent varicose veins   There is increasing evidence for the role of incompetent Perforator veins  or  perforators   in the formation of varicose veins  and recurrent varicose veins    Varicose veins could also be caused by hyperhomocysteinemia in the body  which can degrade and inhibit the formation of the three main structural components of the artery  collagen  elastin and the proteoglycans  Homocysteine permanently degrades cysteine disulfide bridges and lysine amino acid residues in proteins  gradually affecting function and structure  Simply put  homocysteine is a  corrosive  of long living proteins  i e  collagen or elastin  or lifelong proteins  i e  fibrillin  These long term effects are difficult to establish in clinical trials focusing on groups with existing artery decline  See also for differential diagnosis  1  Klippel Trenaunay syndrome  2  Parkes Weber syndrome  4  Treatment  Treatment can be either conservative or active  Active medical intervention can be divided into surgical and non surgical treatments  Newer methods including endovenous laser treatment  radiofrequency ablation and foam sclerotherapy appear to work as well as surgery for varices of the greater saphenous vein   4 1  Conservative  The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence  NICE  produced clinical guidelines in July 2013 recommending that all people with syptomatic varicose veins  C2S  and worse should be referred to a vascular service for treatment  Conservative treatments such as support stockings should not be used unless treatment was not possible   The symptoms of varicose veins can be controlled to an extent with the following   Elevating the legs often provides temporary symptomatic relief   Advice about regular exercise sounds sensible but is not supported by any evidence   The wearing of graduated compression stockings with variable pressure gradients  Class II or III  has been shown to correct the swelling  nutritional exchange  and improve the microcirculation in legs affected by varicose veins  They also often provide relief from the discomfort associated with this disease  Caution should be exercised in their use in patients with concurrent arterial disease   The wearing of intermittent pneumatic compression devices have been shown to reduce swelling and increase circulation  Diosmin Hesperidine and other flavonoids   Anti inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or aspirin can be used as part of treatment for superficial thrombophlebitis along with graduated compression hosiery â€“ but there is a risk of intestinal bleeding  In extensive superficial thrombophlebitis  consideration should be given to anti coagulation  thrombectomy or sclerotherapy of the involved vein   Topical gel application  helps in managing symptoms related to varicose veins such as inflammation  pain  swelling  itching and dryness  Topical application Noninvasive and has patient compliance   4 2  Surgical  Several techniques have been performed for over a century  from the more invasive saphenous stripping  to less invasive procedures like ambulatory phlebectomy and CHIVA   4 2 1  Stripping  Stripping consists of removal of all or part the saphenous vein  great long or lesser short  main trunk  The complications include deep vein thrombosis  5 3%   pulmonary embolism  0 06%   and wound complications including infection  2 2%   There is evidence for the Great Saphenous Vein growing back again after stripping  For traditional surgery  reported recurrence rates  which have been tracked for 10 years  range from 5â€“60%  In addition  since stripping removes the saphenous main trunks  they are no longer available for use as venous bypass grafts in the future  coronary or leg artery vital disease   4 2 2  Other  Other surgical treatments are   Ambulatory phlebectomy  Vein ligation  Cryosurgery  A cryoprobe is passed down the long saphenous vein following saphenofemoral ligation  Then the probe is cooled with NO2 or CO2 to a temperature of âˆ’85o  The vein freezes to the probe and can be retrogradely stripped after 5 second of freezing  It is a variant of Stripping  The only point of this technique is to avoid a distal incision to remove the stripper   4 2 3  Sclerotherapy  A commonly performed non surgical treatment for varicose and  spider  leg veins is sclerotherapy in which medicine  sclerosant  is injected into the veins to make them shrink  The medicines that are commonly used as sclerosants are polidocanol  POL   sodium tetradecyl sulphate  STS   Sclerodex  Canada   Hypertonic Saline  Glycerin and Chromated Glycerin  STS  branded Fibrovein in Australia  and Polidocanol  branded Asclera in the United States  Aethoxysklerol in Australia  liquids can be mixed at varying concentrations of sclerosant and varying sclerosant gas proportions  with air or CO2 or O2 to create foams  Foams may allow more veins to be treated per session with comparable efficacy  Their use in contrast to liquid sclerosant is still somewhat controversial  Sclerotherapy has been used in the treatment of varicose veins for over 150 years  Sclerotherapy is often used for telangiectasias  spider veins  and varicose veins that persist or recur after vein stripping  Sclerotherapy can also be performed using foamed sclerosants under ultrasound guidance to treat larger varicose veins  including the great saphenous and small saphenous veins  A study by Kanter and Thibault in 1996 reported a 76% success rate at 24 months in treating saphenofemoral junction and great saphenous vein incompetence with STS 3% solution  A Cochrane Collaboration review concluded sclerotherapy was better than surgery in the short term  1 year  for its treatment success  complication rate and cost  but surgery was better after 5 years  although the research is weak  A Health Technology Assessment found that sclerotherapy provided less benefit than surgery  but is likely to provide a small benefit in varicose veins without reflux  This Health Technology Assessment monograph includes reviews of the epidemiology  assessment  and treatment of varicose veins  as well as a study on clinical and cost effectiveness of surgery and sclerotherapy  Complications of sclerotherapy are rare but can include blood clots and ulceration  Anaphylactic reactions are  extraordinarily rare but can be life threatening   and doctors should have resuscitation equipment ready  There has been one reported case of stroke after ultrasound guided sclerotherapy when an unusually large dose of sclerosant foam was injected   4 2 4  Endovenous thermal ablation  The Australian Medical Services Advisory Committee  MSAC  in 2008 has determined that endovenous laser treatment ablation  ELA  for varicose veins  appears to be more effective in the short term  and at least as effective overall  as the comparative procedure of junction ligation and vein stripping for the treatment of varicose veins   It also found in its assessment of available literature  that  occurrence rates of more severe complications such as DVT  nerve injury and paraesthesia  post operative infections and haematomas  appears to be greater after ligation and stripping than after EVLT   Complications for ELA include minor skin burns  0 4%  and temporary paraesthesia  2 1%   The longest study of endovenous laser ablation is 39 months   Two prospective randomized trials found speedier recovery and fewer complications after radiofrequency ablation  ERA  compared to open surgery  Myers wrote that open surgery for small saphenous vein reflux is obsolete  Myers said these veins should be treated with endovenous techniques  citing high recurrence rates after surgical management  and risk of nerve damage up to 15%  In comparison  ERA has been shown to control 80% of cases of small saphenous vein reflux at 4 years  said Myers  Complications for ERA include burns  paraesthesia  clinical phlebitis  and slightly higher rates of deep vein thrombosis  0 57%  and pulmonary embolism  0 17%   One 3 year study compared ERA  with a recurrence rate of 33%  to open surgery  which had a recurrence rate of 23%   ELA and ERA require specialized training for doctors and expensive equipment  ELA is performed as an outpatient procedure and does not require the use of an operating theatre  nor does the patient need a general anaesthetic  Doctors must use high frequency ultrasound during the procedure to visualize the anatomical relationships between the saphenous structures  Some practitioners also perform phlebectomy or ultrasound guided sclerotherapy at the time of endovenous treatment  Follow up treatment to smaller branch varicose veins is often needed in the weeks or months after the initial procedure   5  See also  Saphena varix  Varicocele  6  References  7  External links   U S
