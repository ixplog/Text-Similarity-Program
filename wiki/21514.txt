Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology  Nanomedicine ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials  to nanoelectronic biosensors  and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology  Current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials  materials whose structure is on the scale of nanometers  i e  billionths of a meter    Functionalities can be added to nanomaterials by interfacing them with biological molecules or structures  The size of nanomaterials is similar to that of most biological molecules and structures  therefore  nanomaterials can be useful for both in vivo and in vitro biomedical research and applications  Thus far  the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devices  contrast agents  analytical tools  physical therapy applications  and drug delivery vehicles   Nanomedicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically useful devices in the near future  The National Nanotechnology Initiative expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems  new therapies  and in vivo imaging  Nanomedicine research is receiving funding from the US National Institutes of Health  including the funding in 2005 of a five year plan to set up four nanomedicine centers   Nanomedicine is a large industry  with nanomedicine sales reaching $6 8 billion in 2004  and with over 200 companies and 38 products worldwide  a minimum of $3 8 billion in nanotechnology R&D is being invested every year  In April 2006  the journal Nature Materials estimated that 130 nanotech based drugs and delivery systems were being developed worldwide  As the nanomedicine industry continues to grow  it is expected to have a significant impact on the economy   1  Drug delivery  Nanotechnology has provided the possibility of delivering drugs to specific cells using nanoparticles  The overall drug consumption and side effects may be lowered significantly by depositing the active agent in the morbid region only and in no higher dose than needed  Targeted drug delivery is intended to reduce the side effects of drugs with concomitant decreases in consumption and treatment expenses  Drug delivery focuses on maximizing bioavailability both at specific places in the body and over a period of time  This can potentially be achieved by molecular targeting by nanoengineered devices  More than $65 billion are wasted each year due to poor bioavailability  A benefit of using nanoscale for medical technologies is that smaller devices are less invasive and can possibly be implanted inside the body  plus biochemical reaction times are much shorter  These devices are faster and more sensitive than typical drug delivery  The efficacy of drug delivery through nanomedicine is largely based upon  a  efficient encapsulation of the drugs  b  successful delivery of drug to the targeted region of the body  and c  successful release of the drug   Drug delivery systems  lipid  or polymer based nanoparticles  can be designed to improve the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the drug  However  the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedicine is highly variable among different patients  When designed to avoid the body s defence mechanisms  nanoparticles have beneficial properties that can be used to improve drug delivery  Complex drug delivery mechanisms are being developed  including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm  Triggered response is one way for drug molecules to be used more efficiently  Drugs are placed in the body and only activate on encountering a particular signal  For example  a drug with poor solubility will be replaced by a drug delivery system where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments exist  improving the solubility  Drug delivery systems may also be able to prevent tissue damage through regulated drug release  reduce drug clearance rates  or lower the volume of distribution and reduce the effect on non target tissue  However  the biodistribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due to the complex host s reactions to nano  and microsized materials and the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body  Nevertheless  a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better understand the potential and limitations of nanoparticulate systems  While advancement of research proves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles  the dangers of nanotoxicity become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses   Nanoparticles can be used in combination therapy for decreasing antibiotic resistance or for their antimicrobial properties  Nanoparticles might also used to circumvent multidrug resistance  MDR  mechanisms   1 1  Types of systems used  Two forms of nanomedicine that have already been tested in mice and are awaiting human trials that will be using gold nanoshells to help diagnose and treat cancer  and using liposomes as vaccine adjuvants and as vehicles for drug transport  Similarly  drug detoxification is also another application for nanomedicine which has shown promising results in rats  Advances in Lipid nanotechnology was also instrumental in engineering medical nanodevices and novel drug delivery systems as well as in developing sensing applications  Another example can be found in dendrimers and nanoporous materials  Another example is to use block co polymers  which form micelles for drug encapsulation   Polymeric nano particles are a competing technology to lipidic  based mainly on Phospholipids  nano particles  There is an additional risk of toxicity associated with polymers not widely studied or understood  The major advantages of polymers is stability  lower cost and predictable characterisation  However  in the patient s body this very stability  slow degradation  is a negative factor  Phospholipids on the other hand are membrane lipids  already present in the body and surrounding each cell   have a GRAS  Generally Recognised As Safe  status from FDA and are derived from natural sources without any complex chemistry involved  They are not metabolised but rather absorbed by the body and the degradation products are themselves nutrients  fats or micronutrients    Protein and peptides exert multiple biological actions in the human body and they have been identified as showing great promise for treatment of various diseases and disorders  These macromolecules are called biopharmaceuticals  Targeted and or controlled delivery of these biopharmaceuticals using nanomaterials like nanoparticles and Dendrimers is an emerging field called nanobiopharmaceutics  and these products are called nanobiopharmaceuticals   Another vision is based on small electromechanical systems  nanoelectromechanical systems are being investigated for the active release of drugs  Some potentially important applications include cancer treatment with iron nanoparticles or gold shells Nanotechnology is also opening up new opportunities in implantable delivery systems  which are often preferable to the use of injectable drugs  because the latter frequently display first order kinetics  the blood concentration goes up rapidly  but drops exponentially over time   This rapid rise may cause difficulties with toxicity  and drug efficacy can diminish as the drug concentration falls below the targeted range   1 2  Applications  Some nanotechnology based drugs that are commercially available or in human clinical trials include   Abraxane  approved by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  to treat breast cancer  non small  cell lung cancer  NSCLC  and pancreatic cancer  is the nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel   Doxil was originally approved by the FDA for the use on HIV related Kaposi s sarcoma  It is now being used to also treat ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma  The drug is encased in liposomes  which helps to extend the life of the drug that is being distributed  Liposomes are self assembling  spherical  closed colloidal structures that are composed of lipid bilayers that surround an aqueous space  The liposomes also help to increase the functionality and it helps to decrease the damage that the drug does to the heart muscles specifically   C dots  Cornell dots  are the smallest silica based nanoparticles with the size  10 nm  The particles are infused with organic dye which will light up with fluorescence  Clinical trial is underway since 2011 to use the C dots as diagnostic tool to assist surgeons to identify the location of tumor cells   An early phase clinical trial using the platform of ‘Minicell’ nanoparticle for drug delivery have been tested on patients with advanced and untreatable cancer  Built from the membranes of mutant bacteria  the minicells were loaded with paclitaxel and coated with cetuximab  antibodies that bind the epidermal growth factor receptor  EGFR  which is often overexpressed in a number of cancers  as a  homing  device to the tumor cells  The tumor cells recognize the bacteria from which the minicells have been derived  regard it as invading microorganism and engulf it  Once inside  the payload of anti cancer drug kills the tumor cells  Measured at 400 nanometers  the minicell is bigger than synthetic particles developed for drug delivery  The researchers indicated that this larger size gives the minicells a better profile in side effects because the minicells will preferentially leak out of the porous blood vessels around the tumor cells and do not reach the liver  digestive system and skin  This Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that this treatment is well tolerated by the patients  As a platform technology  the minicell drug delivery system can be used to treat a number of different cancers with different anti cancer drugs with the benefit of lower dose and less side effects   1 2 1  Cancer  Another nanoproperty  high surface area to volume ratio  allows many functional groups to be attached to a nanoparticle  which can seek out and bind to certain tumor cells  Additionally  the small size of nanoparticles  10 to 100 nanometers   allows them to preferentially accumulate at tumor sites  because tumors lack an effective lymphatic drainage system   Limitations to conventional cancer chemotherapy include drug resistance  lack of selectivity  and lack of solubility  Nanoparticles have the potential to overcome these problems   In photodynamic therapy  a particle is placed within the body and is illuminated with light from the outside  The light gets absorbed by the particle and if the particle is metal  energy from the light will heat the particle and surrounding tissue  Light may also be used to produce high energy oxygen molecules which will chemically react with and destroy most organic molecules that are next to them  like tumors   This therapy is appealing for many reasons  It does not leave a  toxic trail  of reactive molecules throughout the body  chemotherapy  because it is directed where only the light is shined and the particles exist  Photodynamic therapy has potential for a noninvasive procedure for dealing with diseases  growth and tumors  Kanzius RF therapy is one example of such therapy  Also  gold nanoparticles have the potential to join numerous therapeutic functions into a single platform  by targeting specific tumor cells  tissues and organs   2  Visualization  In vivo imaging is another area where tools and devices are being developed  Using nanoparticle contrast agents  images such as ultrasound and MRI have a favorable distribution and improved contrast  This might be accomplished by self assembled biocompatible nanodevices that will detect  evaluate  treat and report to the clinical doctor automatically   The small size of nanoparticles endows them with properties that can be very useful in oncology  particularly in imaging  Quantum dots  nanoparticles with quantum confinement properties  such as size tunable light emission   when used in conjunction with MRI  magnetic resonance imaging   can produce exceptional images of tumor sites  Nanoparticles of cadmium selenide  quantum dots  glow when exposed to ultraviolet light  When injected  they seep into cancer tumors  The surgeon can see the glowing tumor  and use it as a guide for more accurate tumor removal These nanoparticles are much brighter than organic dyes and only need one light source for excitation  This means that the use of fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher contrast image and at a lower cost than today s organic dyes used as contrast media  The downside  however  is that quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements   Tracking movement can help determine how well drugs are being distributed or how substances are metabolized  It is difficult to track a small group of cells throughout the body  so scientists used to dye the cells  These dyes needed to be excited by light of a certain wavelength in order for them to light up  While different color dyes absorb different frequencies of light  there was a need for as many light sources as cells  A way around this problem is with luminescent tags  These tags are quantum dots attached to proteins that penetrate cell membranes  The dots can be random in size  can be made of bio inert material  and they demonstrate the nanoscale property that color is size dependent  As a result  sizes are selected so that the frequency of light used to make a group of quantum dots fluoresce is an even multiple of the frequency required to make another group incandesce  Then both groups can be lit with a single light source  They have also found a way to insert nanoparticles into the affected parts of the body so that those parts of the body will glow showing the tumor growth or shrinkage or also organ trouble   3  Sensing  Nanotechnology on a chip is one more dimension of lab on a chip technology  Magnetic nanoparticles  bound to a suitable antibody  are used to label specific molecules  structures or microorganisms  Gold nanoparticles tagged with short segments of DNA can be used for detection of genetic sequence in a sample  Multicolor optical coding for biological assays has been achieved by embedding different sized quantum dots into polymeric microbeads  Nanopore technology for analysis of nucleic acids converts strings of nucleotides directly into electronic signatures   Sensor test chips containing thousands of nanowires  able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells  could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patient s blood Nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes  which are pencil sized devices that are used in surgeries with lights and cameras so surgeons can do the surgeries with smaller incisions  The smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients  It is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair   4  Tissue engineering  Nanotechnology may be used as part of tissue engineering to help reproduce or repair damaged tissue using suitable nanomaterial based scaffolds and growth factors  Tissue engineering if successful may replace conventional treatments like organ transplants or artificial implants  Nanoparticles such as graphene  carbon nanotubes  molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are being used as reinforcing agents to fabricate mechanically strong biodegradable polymeric nanocomposites for bone tissue engineering applications  The addition of these nanoparticles in the polymer matrix at low concentrations  ~0 2 weight %  leads to significant improvements in the compressive and flexural mechanical properties of polymeric nanocomposites  Potentially  these nanocomposites may be used as a novel  mechanically strong  light weight composite as bone implants   For example  a flesh welder was demonstrated to fuse two pieces of chicken meat into a single piece using a suspension of gold coated nanoshells activated by an infrared laser  This could be used to weld arteries during surgery  Another example is nanonephrology  the use of nanomedicine on the kidney   5  Medical devices  Neuro electronic interfacing is a visionary goal dealing with the construction of nanodevices that will permit computers to be joined and linked to the nervous system  This idea requires the building of a molecular structure that will permit control and detection of nerve impulses by an external computer  A refuelable strategy implies energy is refilled continuously or periodically with external sonic  chemical  tethered  magnetic  or biological electrical sources  while a nonrefuelable strategy implies that all power is drawn from internal energy storage which would stop when all energy is drained  A nanoscale enzymatic biofuel cell for self powered nanodevices have been developed that uses glucose from biofluids including human blood and watermelons  One limitation to this innovation is the fact that electrical interference or leakage or overheating from power consumption is possible  The wiring of the structure is extremely difficult because they must be positioned precisely in the nervous system  The structures that will provide the interface must also be compatible with the body s immune system   Molecular nanotechnology is a speculative subfield of nanotechnology regarding the possibility of engineering molecular assemblers  machines which could re order matter at a molecular or atomic scale  Nanomedicine would make use of these nanorobots  introduced into the body  to repair or detect damages and infections  Molecular nanotechnology is highly theoretical  seeking to anticipate what inventions nanotechnology might yield and to propose an agenda for future inquiry  The proposed elements of molecular nanotechnology  such as molecular assemblers and nanorobots are far beyond current capabilities   6  See also  Nanoparticle–biomolecule conjugate  Nanobiotechnology  Nanotechnology in fiction  Colloidal gold  gold
