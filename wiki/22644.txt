The Ottonian dynasty was a dynasty of German Kings  919–1024   named after its first Emperor but also known as the Saxon dynasty after the family s origin  The family itself is also sometimes known as the Liudolfings  after its earliest known member Liudolf and one of its primary leading names  The Ottonian rulers were successors of the Frankish Carolingian dynasty in Germany   1  Ruling in Germany and the Holy Roman Empire  Although never Emperor  Henry I the Fowler  Duke of Saxony  was arguably the founder of this imperial dynasty  since his election as German king in 919 made it possible for his son  Otto the Great to take on the imperium  Under the reign of the Ottonian rulers  the kingdom of the Eastern Franks included of the duchies of Lorraine  Saxony  Franconia  Swabia  Thuringia  and Bavaria   Otto I inherited the Duchy of Saxony upon the death of his father in 936  He continued his father s work of unifying all of the German tribes into a single kingdom  greatly expanding the powers of the king at the expense of the aristocracy  Through strategic marriages and personal appointments  Otto installed members of his own family to the Kingdom s most important duchies  This reduced the various Dukes  who had previously been co equals with the king  into royal subjects under the king s authority  Otto also transformed the Church in Germany into a major royal power base to which he donated charity and for the creation of which his family was responsible  After putting down a brief civil war  Otto defeated the Magyars in 955  ending the Hungarian invasions of Europe and as well as securing his hold over his kingdom  The victory against the pagan Magyars earned Otto the reputation as the savior of Christendom  By 961  Otto had conquered the Kingdom of Italy  which was a troublesome inheritance that none wanted  and extended the Kingdom s borders to the north  east  and south  In control of much of central and southern Europe  the patronage of Otto and his immediate successors caused a limited cultural renaissance of the arts and architecture   By excluding the Bavarian line of Ottonians from the line of succession  Otto s son and successor Otto II strengthened Imperial authority and secured his own son s succession to the Imperial throne  During his reign  Otto II attempted to annex the whole of Italy into the Empire  bringing him into conflict with the Byzantine Empire and with the Saracens of the Fatimid Caliphate  Otto II s campaign against the Saracens ended in 982 following a disastrous defeat  In 983 Otto II experienced a major uprising of the Slavs against his rule  Otto II died suddenly in 983 at the age of 28 after a ten year reign  Succeeded by his three year old son Otto III as King  his sudden death plunged the dynasty into crisis  During her regency for Otto III  the Byzantine princess Theophanu abandoned her late husband s imperialistic policy and devoted herself entirely to furthering her own agenda in Italy   The childless Otto III was succeeded by Henry II in 1002  a son of duke Henry II  Duke of Bavaria who was a member of the Bavarian line of the Ottonians  Henry II spent the next several years consolidating his political power on his borders  He waged a campaign against Boleslaw I of Poland and then moved successfully into the Kingdom of Italy  After the extinction of the Ottonian dynasty with the death of Henry II in 1024 the crown passed to Conrad II of the Salian dynasty  Liutgarde  a daughter of Otto I had married the Salian Duke Conrad the Red of Lorraine  His great grandson was Conrad II  When Rudolph III  King of Burgundy died on 2 February 1032  Conrad II successfully claimed also this Kingship on the basis of an inheritance Emperor Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006  after having invaded Burgundy to enforce his claim after Rudolph attempted to renounce it in 1016   2  Ottonian Kings and Emperors  Henry I the Fowler  King of the East Franks and Duke of Saxony  died 936
