The Madeira River      is a major waterway in South America  approximately long  The Madeira is one of the biggest tributaries of the Amazon  A map from Emanuel Bowen in 1747  held by the David Rumsey Map Collection  refers to the Madeira by the pre colonial  indigenous name Cuyari   The River of Cuyari  called by the Portuguese Madeira or the Wood River  is formed by two great rivers  which join near its mouth  It was by this River  that the Nation of Topinambes passed into the River Amazon   1  Climate  The mean inter annual precipitations on the great basins vary from   the entire upper Madeira basin receiving   The greatest extremes of rainfall are between   At its head  the Madeira on its own is still one of the largest rivers of the world  with a mean inter annual discharge of   i e   yr  approximately half the discharge of the Congo River  The mean inter annual contribution of the Bolivian Andes is   i e  yr  representing 25% of the discharge of the entire upper Madeira basin  On the further course towards the Amazon  the mean discharge of the Madeira increases up to    2  Course  Between Guajará Mirim and the falls of Teotônio  the Madeira receives the drainage of the north eastern slopes of the Andes from Santa Cruz de la Sierra to Cuzco  the whole of the south western slope of Brazilian Mato Grosso and the northern slope of the Chiquitos sierras  In total  the catchment area is 850 000 km2  almost equal in area to France and Spain combined  The waters flow into the Madeira from many large rivers  the principal of which   from east to west   are the Guaporé or Itenez  the Baures and Blanco  the Itonama or San Miguel  the Mamoré  Beni  and Mayutata or Madre de Dios  all of which are reinforced by numerous secondary but powerful affluents  The climate of the upper catchment area varies from humid in the western edge with the origin of the river s main stem by volume  Río Madre de Dios  Río Beni  to semi arid in the southernmost part with the andine headwaters of the main stem by length  Río Caine  Río Rocha  Río Grande  Mamoré    All of the upper branches of the river Madeira find their way to the falls across the open  almost level Mojos and Beni plains  of which are yearly flooded to an average depth of about for a period of from three to four months   The falls of Teotônio and of San Antonio exceed the more famous Boyoma Falls in Africa by volume and total drop  From these rapids  the Madeira flows northward forming the border between Bolivia and Brazil for approximately   Below the confluence of the Rio Abunã  the Madeira meanders north eastward through the Rondônia and Amazonas states of north west Brazil to its junction with the Amazon  At its mouth is Ilha Tupinambaranas  an extensive marshy region formed by the Madeira’s distributaries   3  Navigation  The Madeira river rises more than 15 m  50 ft  during the rainy season  and ocean vessels may ascend it to the Falls of San Antonio  near Porto Velho  Brazil  above its mouth  but in the dry months  from June to November  it is only navigable for the same distance for craft drawing about 2 m  from 5 to 6 feet  of water  The Madeira Mamoré Railroad runs in a loop around the unnavigable section to Guajará Mirim on the Mamoré River  but is not functional  limiting shipping from the Atlantic at Porto Velho   Today  it is also one of the Amazon Basin s most active waterways  and helps export close to 4 million tons of grains  which are loaded onto barges in Porto Velho  where both Cargill and Amaggi have loading facilities  and then shipped down the Madeira to the ports of Itacoatiara  near the mouth of the Madeira  just upstream on the left bank of the Amazon  or further down the Amazon  to the port of Santarem  at the mouth of the Tapajos River  From these two ports  Panamax type ships then export the grains   mainly soy and corn   to Europe and Asia  The Madeira waterway is also used to take fuel from the REMAN refinery  Petrobras  in Manaus  state capital of Amazonas  to Porto Velho  from where the states of Acre  Rondonia and parts of Mato Grosso are supplied mainly with gasoline  petrol  refined in Manaus  Cargo barges also use the Madeira on the route between Manaus and Porto Velho  which is 1 225 km along the Rio Negro  Amazon and Madeira  connecting Manaus  industrial district with the rest of Brazil  as Manaus is land locked as far as logistics with the rest of the country are concerned  to bring in part of its raw materials  and export its produce to the major consumer centres of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro  In 2012  the cargo amounted to 287 835 tons  both directions   The total tonnage shipped in 2012 on the Madeira accounted to 5 076 014   Two large dams  see below  are under construction as part of the IIRSA regional integration project  The dam projects include large ship locks capable of moving oceangoing vessels between the impounded reservoir and the downstream river  If the project is completed   more than 4 000 km of waterways upstream from the dams in Brazil  Bolivia  and Peru would become navigable     4  Ecology  As typical of Amazonian rivers with the primary headwaters in the Andes  the Madeira River is turbid because of high sediment levels and it is whitewater  but some of its tributaries are clearwater  e g   Aripuanã and Ji Paraná  or blackwater  e g   Manicoré    A subspecies of boto  Amazon river dolphin  inhabits the Madeira River system  It has been estimated that there are more than 900 fish species in the Madeira River Basin  making it one of the freshwater systems in the world with the highest species richness   5  In popular culture  The river is the fifth title of the album Aguas da Amazonia   6  Dams  In July 2007  plans have been approved by the Brazilian Government to construct two hydroelectric dams on the Madeira River  the Santo Antonio Dam near Porto Velho and the Jirau Dam about 100 km upstream  Both the Jirau and Santo Antonio dams are run of the river projects that do not impound a large reservoir  Both dams also feature significant environmental re mediation efforts  such as fish ladders   As a consequence  there has not been strong environmental opposition to the implementation of the Madeira river complex  However  critics point out that if the fish ladders fail   several valuable migratory fish species could suffer near extinction as a result of the Madeira dams   There are also concerns with deforestation and pressure on conservation areas and indigenous peoples  territories  The Worldwatch institute has also criticized the fast track approval process for  kindler  gentler dams with smaller reservoirs  designed to lessen social and environmental impacts   claiming that no project should  fast track the licensing of new dams in Amazonia and allow projects to circumvent Brazil s tough environmental laws    7  References  8  External links  from 1875
