The Ministry for State Security  German  Ministerium für Staatssicherheit  MfS   commonly known as the Stasi     abbreviation   literally State Security   also State Security Service  German Staatssicherheitsdienst  SSD   was the official state security service of the German Democratic Republic  GDR   colloquially known as East Germany  It has been described as one of the most effective and repressive intelligence and secret police agencies to ever have existed  The Stasi was headquartered in East Berlin  with an extensive complex in Berlin Lichtenberg and several smaller facilities throughout the city  The Stasi motto was  Schild und Schwert der Partei   Shield and Sword of the Party   referring to the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany  SED    One of its main tasks was spying on the population  mainly through a vast network of citizens turned informants  and fighting any opposition by overt and covert measures including hidden psychological destruction of dissidents  Zersetzung  literally meaning decomposition   Its Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung was responsible for both espionage and for conducting covert operations in foreign countries  Under its long time head Markus Wolf it gained a reputation as one of the most effective intelligence agencies of the Cold War  Numerous Stasi officials were prosecuted for their crimes after 1990  After German reunification  the surveillance files that the Stasi had maintained on millions of East Germans were laid open  so that any citizen could inspect their personal file on request  these files are now maintained by the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records   1  Creation  The Stasi was founded on 8 February 1950  Wilhelm Zaisser was the first Minister of State Security of the GDR  and Erich Mielke was his deputy  Zaisser tried to depose SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht after the June 1953 uprising  and after this was removed by Ulbricht and replaced with Ernst Wollweber  Wollweber resigned in 1957 after clashes with Ulbricht and Erich Honecker  and was succeeded by his deputy  Erich Mielke   In 1957  Markus Wolf became head of the Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung  HVA   General Reconnaissance Administration   the foreign intelligence section of the Stasi  As intelligence chief  Wolf achieved great success in penetrating the government  political and business circles of West Germany with spies  The most influential case was that of Günter Guillaume  which led to the downfall of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in May 1974  In 1986  Wolf retired and was succeeded by Werner Grossmann   2  Relationship with the KGB  Although Mielke s Stasi was superficially granted independence in 1957  until 1990 the KGB continued to maintain liaison officers in all eight main Stasi directorates  each with his own office inside the Stasi s Berlin compound  and in each of the fifteen Stasi district headquarters around East Germany  Collaboration was so close that the KGB invited the Stasi to establish operational bases in Moscow and Leningrad to monitor visiting East German tourists and Mielke referred to the Stasi officers as  Chekists of the Soviet Union   In 1978  Mielke formally granted KGB officers in East Germany the same rights and powers they enjoyed in the Soviet Union   3  Organization  The Ministry for State Security also included the following entities   Administration 12 was responsible for the surveillance of mail and telephone communications   Administration 2000 was responsible for the reliability of National People s Army  NVA  personnel  Admin 2000 operated a secret  unofficial network of informants within the NVA   Administration for Security of Heavy Industry and Research and Main Administration for Security of the Economy  protection against sabotage or espionage   Division of Garbage Analysis  was responsible for analyzing garbage for any suspect western foods and or materials   Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment  the armed force at disposal of the ministry  named for the founder of the Cheka  the Bolshevik secret police  The members of this regiment  who served at least three years  were responsible for protecting high government and party buildings and personnel  The regiment was composed of six motorized rifle battalions  one artillery battalion  and one training battalion  Its equipment included PSZH IV armored personnel carriers  120 mm mortars  85 mm and 100 mm antitank guns  ZU 23 antiaircraft guns  and helicopters  A Swiss source reported in 1986 that the troops of the Ministry of State Security also had commando units similar to the Soviet Union s Spetsnaz GRU forces  These East German units were said to wear the uniform of the airborne troops  although with the violet collar patch of the Ministry for State Security rather than the orange one of paratroopers  They also wore the sleeve stripe of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment   Main Administration for Reconnaissance  focused its efforts primarily upon West Germany and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  but it also operated East German intelligence in all foreign countries   Main Administration for Struggle Against Suspicious Persons was charged with the surveillance of foreigners — particularly from the West — legally traveling or residing within the country  This included the diplomatic community  tourists  and official guests   Main Coordinating Administration of the Ministry for State Security  coordinated its work with Soviet intelligence agencies   Main Department for Communications Security and Personnel Protection  provided personal security for the national leadership and maintained and operated an internal secure communications system for the government   Penal System  to facilitate its mission of enforcing the political security of East Germany  the Stasi operated its own penal system  distinct from that of the Ministry of the Interior  This system comprised prison camps for political  as opposed to criminal  offenders   4  Operations  4 1  Personnel and recruitment  Between 1950 and 1989  the Stasi employed a total of 274 000 people in an effort to root out the class enemy  In 1989  the Stasi employed 91 015 persons full time  including 2 000 fully employed unofficial collaborators  13 073 soldiers and 2 232 officers of GDR army  along with 173 081 unofficial informants inside GDR and 1 553 informants in West Germany   Regular commissioned Stasi officers were recruited from conscripts who had been honourably discharged from their 28 months  compulsory military service  who had been members of the SED  had had a high level of participation in the Party s youth wing s activities and had been Stasi informers during their service in the Military  The candidates would then have to be recommended by their military unit political officers and Stasi agents  the local chiefs of the District  Bezirke  Stasi and Volkspolizei office  of the district in which they were permanently resident  and the District Secretary of the SED  These candidates were then made to sit through several tests and exams which identified their intellectual capacity to be an officer  and their political reliability  University graduates who had completed their military service did not need to take these tests and exams  They then attended a two year officer training programme at the Stasi college  Hochschule  in Potsdam  Less mentally and academically endowed candidates were made ordinary technicians and attended a one year technology intensive course for non commissioned officers   By 1995 some 174 000 inoffizielle Mitarbeiter IMs  Stasi informants had been identified  almost 2 5% of East Germany s population between the ages of 18 and 60  10 000 IMs were under 18 years of age  From the volume of material destroyed in the final days of the regime the office of the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records  BStU  believes that there could have been as many as 500 000 informers  A former Stasi colonel who served in the counterintelligence directorate estimated that the figure could be as high as 2 million if occasional informants were included   4 2  Infiltration  Full time officers were posted to all major industrial plants  the extensiveness of any surveillance largely depended on how valuable a product was to the economy  and one tenant in every apartment building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the Volkspolizei  Vopo   Spies reported every relative or friend who stayed the night at another s apartment  Tiny holes were drilled in apartment and hotel room walls through which Stasi agents filmed citizens with special video cameras  Schools  universities  and hospitals were extensively infiltrated   The Stasi had formal categorizations of each type of informant  and had official guidelines on how to extract information from  and control  those who they came into contact with  The roles of informants ranged from those already in some way involved in state security  such as the police and the armed services  to those in the dissident movements  such as in the arts and the Protestant Church   Information gathered about the latter groups was frequently used to divide or discredit members  Informants were made to feel important  given material or social incentives  and were imbued with a sense of adventure  and only around 7 7%  according to official figures  were coerced into cooperating  A significant proportion of those informing were members of the SED  to employ some form of blackmail  however  was not uncommon  A large number of Stasi informants were trolley conductors  janitors  doctors  nurses and teachers  Mielke believed the best informants were those whose jobs entailed frequent contact with the public   The Stasi s ranks swelled considerably after Eastern Bloc countries signed the 1975 Helsinki accords  which GDR leader Erich Honecker viewed as a grave threat to his regime because they contained language binding signatories to respect  human and basic rights  including freedom of thought  conscience  religion  and conviction   The number of IMs peaked at around 180 000 in that year  having slowly risen from 20 000–30 000 in the early 1950s  and reaching 100 000 for the first time in 1968  in response to Ostpolitik and protests worldwide  The Stasi also acted as a proxy for KGB to conduct activities in other Eastern Bloc countries  such as Poland  where the Soviets were despised   The Stasi infiltrated almost every aspect of GDR life  In the mid 1980s  a network of IMs began growing in both German states  by the time East Germany collapsed in 1989  the Stasi employed 91 015 employees and 173 081 informants  About one of every 63 East Germans collaborated with the Stasi  By at least one estimate  the Stasi maintained greater surveillance over its own people than any secret police force in history  The Stasi employed one full time agent for every 166 East Germans  The ratios swelled when informers were factored in  counting part time informers  the Stasi had one informer per 6 5 people  By comparison  the Gestapo employed one secret policeman per 2 000 people  This comparison led Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal to call the Stasi even more oppressive than the Gestapo  Additionally  Stasi agents infiltrated and undermined West Germany s government and spy agencies   In some cases  spouses even spied on each other  A high profile example of this was peace activist Vera Lengsfeld  whose husband  Knud Wollenberger  was a Stasi informant   4 3  Zersetzung  The Stasi perfected the technique of psychological harassment of perceived enemies known as Zersetzung    – a term borrowed from chemistry which literally means  decomposition    By the 1970s  the Stasi had decided that methods of overt persecution which had been employed up to that time  such as arrest and torture  were too crude and obvious  It was realised that psychological harassment was far less likely to be recognised for what it was  so its victims  and their supporters  were less likely to be provoked into active resistance  given that they would often not be aware of the source of their problems  or even its exact nature  Zersetzung was designed to side track and  switch off  perceived enemies so that they would lose the will to continue any  inappropriate  activities   Tactics employed under Zersetzung generally involved the disruption of the victim s private or family life  This often included psychological attacks such as breaking into homes and subtly manipulating the contents  in a form of gaslighting – moving furniture  altering the timing of an alarm  removing pictures from walls or replacing one variety of tea with another  Other practices included property damage  sabotage of cars  purposely incorrect medical treatment  smear campaigns including sending falsified compromising photos or documents to the victim s family  denunciation  provocation  psychological warfare  psychological subversion  wiretapping  bugging  mysterious phone calls or unnecessary deliveries  even including sending a vibrator to a target s wife  Usually victims had no idea the Stasi were responsible  Many thought they were losing their minds  and mental breakdowns and suicide could result   One great advantage of the harassment perpetrated under Zersetzung was that its subtle nature meant that it was able to be plausibly denied  This was important given that the GDR was trying to improve its international standing during the 1970s and 80s  especially in conjunction with the Ostpolitik of West German chancellor Willy Brandt massively improving relations between the two German states   Zersetzung techniques have since been adopted by other security agencies  particularly the Russian Federal Security Service  FSB    5  International operations  Other files  the Rosenholz Files   which contained the names of East German spies abroad  led American spy agencies to capture them  After German reunification  revelations of Stasi s international activities were publicized  such as its military training to the West German Red Army Faction   Directorate X was responsible for disinformation  Rolf Wagenbreth  director of disinformation operations  stated  Our friends in Moscow call it  dezinformatsiya   Our enemies in America call it  active measures   and I  dear friends  call it ‘my favorite pastime     5 1  Examples  Stasi experts helped to build the secret police of Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia   Fidel Castro s regime in Cuba was particularly interested in receiving training from Stasi  Stasi instructors worked in Cuba and Cuban communists received training in East Germany  The Stasi chief Markus Wolf described how he set up the Cuban system on the pattern of the East German system   Stasi officers helped in initial training and indoctrination of Egyptian State Security organizations under the Nasser regime from 1957–58 onwards  This was discontinued by Anwar Sadat in 1976   The Stasi s experts worked with building secret police systems in the People s Republic of Angola  the People s Republic of Mozambique  and the People s Republic of Yemen  South Yemen    Stasi organized and extensively trained Syrian intelligence services under the Assad regime and Baath Party from 1966 onwards and especially from 1973   Stasi experts helped to set up Idi Amin s secret police   Stasi experts helped Kwame Nkrumah to build his secret police  When Nkrumah was ousted by a military coup  Stasi Major Jurgen Rogalla was imprisoned   The Stasi sent agents to the West as sleeper agents  For instance  sleeper agent Günter Guillaume became a senior aide to social democratic chancellor Willy Brandt  and reported about his politics and private life   The Stasi operated at least one brothel  Agents were used against both men and women working in Western governments   Entrapment  was used against married men and homosexuals   Martin Schlaff – According to the German parliament s investigations  the Austrian billionaire s Stasi codename was  Landgraf  and registration number  3886 86   He made money by supplying embargoed goods to East Germany   Sokratis Kokkalis – Stasi documents suggest that the Greek businessman was a Stasi agent  whose operations included delivering Western technological secrets and bribing Greek officials to buy outdated East German telecom equipment   Red Army Faction  Baader Meinhof Group —A terrorist organization which killed dozens of West Germans and others   The Stasi ordered a campaign in which cemeteries and other Jewish sites in West Germany were smeared with swastikas and other Nazi symbols  Funds were channelled to a small West German group for it to defend Adolf Eichmann   The Stasi channelled large amounts of money to Neo Nazi groups in West  with the purpose of discrediting the West   The Stasi worked in a campaign to create extensive material and propaganda against Israel   Murder of Benno Ohnesorg – A Stasi informant in the West Berlin police  Karl Heinz Kurras  fatally shot an unarmed demonstrator  which stirred a whole movement of Marxist radicalism  protest  and terrorist violence  The Economist describes it as  the gunshot that hoaxed a generation   The surviving Stasi Records contain no evidence that Kurras was acting under their orders when he shot Ohnesorg   Operation Infektion—The Stasi helped the KGB to spread HIV AIDS disinformation that the United States had created the disease  Millions of people around the world still believe in these claims   Sandoz chemical spill—The KGB reportedly ordered the Stasi to sabotage the chemical factory to distract attention from the Chernobyl disaster six months earlier in Ukraine   Investigators have found evidence of a death squad that carried out a number of assassinations  including assassination of Swedish journalist Cats Falck  on orders from the East German government from 1976 to 1987  Attempts to prosecute members failed   The Stasi attempted to assassinate Wolfgang Welsch  a famous critic of the regime  Stasi collaborator Peter Haack  Stasi codename  Alfons   befriended Welsch and then fed him hamburgers poisoned with thallium  It took weeks for doctors to find out why Welsch had suddenly lost his hair   Documents in the Stasi archives state that the KGB ordered Bulgarian agents to assassinate Pope John Paul II  who was known for his criticism of human rights in the Communist bloc  and the Stasi was asked to help with covering up traces   A special unit of the Stasi assisted Romanian intelligence in kidnapping Romanian dissident Oliviu Beldeanu from West Germany   In 1975  Stasi recorded a conversation between senior West German CDU politicians Helmut Kohl and Kurt Biedenkopf  It was then  leaked  to the Stern magazine as a transcript recorded by American intelligence  The magazine then claimed that Americans were wiretapping West Germans and the public believed the story  * International operations *   6  Fall of the Soviet Union  Recruitment of informants became increasingly difficult towards the end of the GDR s existence  and after 1986  there was a negative turnover rate of IMs  This had a significant impact on the Stasi s ability to survey the population  in a period of growing unrest  and knowledge of the Stasi s activities became more widespread  The Stasi had been tasked during this period with preventing the country s economic difficulties becoming a political problem  through suppression of the very worst problems the state faced  but it failed to do so   Stasi officers reportedly had discussed re branding East Germany as a democratic capitalist country to the West  but which would be in practice taken over by Stasi officers  The plan specified 2 587 OibE officers who would take over power  Offiziere im besonderen Einsatz   officers on special assignment   and it was registered as Top Secret Document 0008 6 86 of 17 March 1986  According to Ion Mihai Pacepa  the chief intelligence officer in communist Romania  other communist intelligence services had similar plans  On 12 March 1990  Der Spiegel reported that the Stasi was indeed attempting to implement 0008 6 86  Pacepa has noted that what happened in Russia and how KGB Colonel Vladimir Putin took over Russia resembles these plans  See Putinism   On 7 November 1989  in response to the rapidly changing political and social situation in the GDR in late 1989  Erich Mielke resigned  On 17 November 1989  the Council of Ministers  Ministerrat der DDR  renamed the Stasi as the  Office for National Security   Amt für Nationale Sicherheit – AfNS   which was headed by Generalleutnant Wolfgang Schwanitz  On 8 December 1989  GDR Prime Minister Hans Modrow directed the dissolution of the AfNS  which was confirmed by a decision of the Ministerrat on 14 December 1989   As part of this decision  the Ministerrat originally called for the evolution of the AfNS into two separate organizations  a new foreign intelligence service  Nachrichtendienst der DDR  and an  Office for the Protection of the Constitution of the GDR   Verfassungsschutz der DDR   along the lines of the West German Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz  however  the public reaction was extremely negative  and under pressure from the  Round Table   Runder Tisch   the government dropped the creation of the Verfassungsschutz der DDR and directed the immediate dissolution of the AfNS on 13 January 1990  Certain functions of the AfNS reasonably related to law enforcement were handed over to the GDR Ministry of Internal Affairs  The same ministry also took guardianship of remaining AfNS facilities   When the parliament of Germany investigated public funds that disappeared after the Fall of the Berlin Wall  it found out that East Germany had transferred large amounts of money to Martin Schlaff through accounts in Vaduz  the capital of Liechtenstein  in return for goods  under Western embargo    Moreover  high ranking Stasi officers continued their post DDR careers in management positions in Schlaff s group of companies  For example  in 1990  Herbert Kohler  Stasi commander in Dresden  transferred 170 million marks to Schlaff for  harddisks  and months later went to work for him  The investigations concluded that  Schlaff s empire of companies played a crucial role  in the Stasi attempts to secure the financial future of Stasi agents and keep the intelligence network alive  The Stern magazine noted that KGB officer Vladimir Putin worked with his Stasi colleagues in Dresden in 1989   In the Soviet Union  about 50 billion U S  dollars were transferred out of the country  see FIMACO    7  Recovery of the Stasi files  During the Peaceful Revolution of 1989  Stasi offices were overrun by enraged citizens  but not before the Stasi destroyed a number of documents  approximately 5%  consisting of  by one calculation  1 billion sheets of paper   7 1  Storming the Stasi headquarters  As the German Democratic Republic began to fall  so too did the Stasi  They began to destroy the extensive files and documents that they had kept  by hand  fire and with the use of shredders   When these activities became known  a protest erupted in front of the Stasi headquarters  In the evening of 15 January 1990  a large crowd of people formed outside the gates in order to stop the destruction of personal files  In their minds  this information should have been available to them and also have been used to punish those who had taken part in Stasi actions  The large group of protesters grew and grew until they were able to overcome the police and gain entry into the complex  The protesters became violent  unruly and destructive as they smashed doors and windows  threw furniture  and trampled or burned portraits of Erich Honecker  Among the destructive public were officers working for the West German government  as well as former Stasi collaborators seeking to destroy documents   7 2  Controversy of the Stasi files  With the German Reunification on 3 October 1990  a new government agency was founded called the Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic    officially abbreviated  BStU   There was a debate about what should happen to the files  whether they should be opened to the people or kept closed   Those who opposed opening the files cited privacy as a reason  They felt that the information in the files would lead to negative feelings about former Stasi members  and  in turn  cause violence  Pastor Rainer Eppelmann  who became Minister of Defense and Disarmament after March 1990  felt that new political freedoms for former Stasi members would be jeopardized by acts of revenge  Prime Minister Lothar de Maizière even went so far as to predict murder  They also argued against the use of the files to capture former Stasi members and prosecute them  arguing that not all former members were criminals and should not be punished solely for being a member  There were also some who believed that everyone was guilty of something  Peter Michael Diestel  the Minister of Interior  opined that these files could not be used to determine innocence and guilt  claiming that  there were only two types of individuals who were truly innocent in this system  the newborn and the alcoholic   Other opinions  such as the one of West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble  believed in putting the Stasi behind them and working on German reunification   Others argued that everyone should have the right to see their own file  and that the files should be opened to investigate former Stasi members and prosecute them  as well as not allow them to hold office  Opening the files would also help clear up some of the rumors that were floating around  Some also believed that politicians involved with the Stasi should be investigated   The fate of the files was finally decided under the Unification Treaty between the GDR and Federal Republic of Germany  FRG   This treaty took the Volkskammer law further and allowed more access and use of the files  Along with the decision to keep the files in a central location in the East  they also decided who could see and use the files  allowing people to see their own files   In 1992  following a declassification ruling by the German government  the Stasi files were opened  leading people to look for their files  Timothy Garton Ash  an English historian  after reading his file  wrote The File  A Personal History   Between 1991 and 2011  around 2 75 million individuals  mostly GDR citizens  requested to see their own files  The ruling also gave people the ability to make duplicates of their documents  Another big issue was how the media could use and benefit from the documents  It was decided that the media could obtain files as long as they were depersonalized and not regarding an individual under the age of 18 or a former Stasi member  This ruling not only gave the media access to the files  but also gave schools access   7 3  Tracking down former Stasi informers with the files  Even though groups of this sort were active in the community  those who were tracking down ex members were  as well  Many of these hunters succeeded in catching ex Stasi  however  charges could not be made for merely being a member  The person in question would have had to participate in an illegal act  not just be a registered Stasi member  Among the high profile individuals who were arrested and tried were Erich Mielke  Third Minister of State Security of the GDR  and Erich Honecker  head of state for the GDR  Mielke was sentenced to six years prison for the murder of two policemen in 1931  Honecker was charged with authorizing the killing of would be escapees on the East West frontier and the Berlin Wall  During his trial  he went through cancer treatment  Because he was nearing death  Honecker was allowed to spend his final time in Chile  He died in May 1994   7 4  Reassembling the destroyed files  Some of it is very easy due to the number of archives and the failure of shredding machines  in some cases  shredding  meant tearing paper in two by hand and documents could be recovered easily   In 1995  the BStU began reassembling the shredded documents  13 years later the three dozen archivists commissioned to the projects had only reassembled 327 bags  they are now using computer assisted data recovery to reassemble the remaining 16 000 bagsestimated at 45 million pages  It is estimated that this task may be completed at a cost of 30 million dollars   The CIA acquired some Stasi records during the looting of the Stasi s archives  The Federal Republic of Germany has asked for their return and received some in April 2000  See also Rosenholz files   8  Museum in the old headquarters  The Anti Stalinist Action Normannenstraße  ASTAK   an association founded by former GDR Citizens  Committees  has transformed the former headquarters of the Stasi into a museum  It is divided into three floors

placed in a glass jar  which was annotated with the victim s name  and archived  Other common ways that the scents would be collected is through breaking into a home and taking parts of garments  The most common garment taken was underpants  because of how close the garment is to the skin  The Stasi would then use trained dogs to track down the person using this scent  Other tools shown here include a tie camera  cigarette box camera  and an AK 47 hidden in luggage   Display gallery of Directorate VII  This part of the museum tells the history of the Stasi  from the beginning of the GDR

Stasi agent Matthias Warnig  codename  Arthur   is currently the CEO of Nord Stream  German investigations have revealed that some of the key Gazprom Germania managers are former Stasi agents   9 2  Lobbying  Former Stasi officers continue to be politically active via the Gesellschaft zur Rechtlichen und Humanitären Unterstützung e  V   Society for Legal and Humanitarian Support   GRH   Former high ranking officers and employees of the Stasi  including the last Stasi director  Wolfgang Schwanitz  make up the majority of the organization s members  and it receives support from the German Communist Party  among others   Impetus for the establishment of the GRH was provided by the criminal charges filed against the Stasi in the early 1990s  The GRH  decrying the charges as  victor s justice   called for them to be dropped  Today the group provides an alternative if somewhat utopian voice in the public debate on the GDR legacy  It calls for the closure of the museum in Hohenschönhausen and can be a vocal presence at memorial services and public events  In March 2006 in Berlin  GRH members disrupted a museum event  a political scandal ensued when the Berlin Senator  Minister  of Culture refused to confront them   Behind the scenes  the GRH also lobbies people and institutions promoting opposing viewpoints  For example  in March 2006  the Berlin Senator for Education received a letter from a GRH member and former Stasi officer attacking the Museum for promoting  falsehoods  anticommunist agitation and psychological terror against minors   Similar letters have also been received by schools organizing field trips to the museum   10  Alleged informants  11  See also  Verfassungsschutz  Global surveillance disclosures  1970–2013   Global surveillance
