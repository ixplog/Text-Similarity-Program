called himself  Al Fayed  since the early 1970s  and his two brothers  Ali and Saleh  also styled themselves  Al Fayed  at the time of their acquisition of the House of Fraser in the 1980s  though by the late 1980s Ali and Saleh had reverted to calling themselves simply  Fayed   Fayed s addition of  Al   to his name  which implies aristocratic origins  has led to Private Eye nicknaming him the  Phoney Pharaoh   According to his biographer Tom Bower  Fayed also claimed to have come from a town named Fayed after his family   2  United Kingdom  2 1  Early business dealings  Fayed and his brothers founded a shipping company in Egypt before moving its headquarters to Genoa  Italy with additional offices in London  Around 1964 Fayed entered a close relationship with Haitian leader François Duvalier  known as  Papa Doc  Duvalier  and became interested in the construction of a Fayed Duvalier oil refinery in Haiti  He also associated with the geologist George de Mohrenschildt  Fayed terminated his stay in Haiti six months later when a sample of  crude oil  provided by Haitian associates proved to be low grade molasses   It was then that Fayed moved to England where he lived in central London  In the mid 1960s  Fayed met the ruler of Dubai  Sheikh Rashid al Makhtoum who entrusted Fayed with helping transform Dubai  Fayed introduced British companies like the Costain Group  of which he became a director and 30 percent shareholder   Bernard Sunley and Taylor Woodrow to the Emirate to carry out the required construction work  He also became a financial adviser to the then Sultan of Brunei Omar Ali Saifuddien III  in 1966   Fayed set up IMS  International Marine Services  in 1968 in Dubai   He briefly joined the board of the mining conglomerate Lonrho in 1975 but left after a disagreement  In 1979  Fayed bought The Ritz hotel in Paris  France for US$30 million   In 1984  Fayed and his brothers purchased a 30 percent stake in House of Fraser  a group that included the famous London store Harrods  from Roland  Tiny  Rowland  the head of Lonrho  In 1985  he and his brothers bought the remaining 70 percent of House of Fraser for £615m  Rowland claimed the Fayed brothers had lied about their background and wealth and put pressure on the government to investigate them  A Department of Trade and Industry  DTI  inquiry into the Fayeds was launched  The DTI s subsequent report was critical  but no action was taken against the Fayeds  and while many believed the contents of the report  others felt it was politically motivated   In 1998  Rowland accused Fayed of stealing papers and jewels from his Harrods safe deposit box  Fayed was arrested  but the charges were dropped  Rowland died in 1998  Fayed settled the dispute with a payment to his widow  he also sued the Metropolitan Police for false arrest in 2002  but lost the case   In 1994  House of Fraser went public  but Fayed retained private ownership of Harrods  He relaunched the humour publication Punch in 1996 but it folded again in 2002  Al Fayed unsuccessfully applied for British citizenship twice   once in 1994 and once in 1999  It was suggested that the feud with Rowland contributed to Fayed s being refused British citizenship the first time   2 2  Cash for questions  In 1994  in what became known as the cash for questions affair  Fayed revealed the names of MPs he had paid to ask questions in parliament on his behalf  but who had failed to declare their fees  It saw the Conservative MPs Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith leave the government in disgrace  and a Committee on Standards in Public Life established to prevent such corruption occurring again  Fayed also revealed that the cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken had stayed for free at the Ritz Hotel in Paris at the same time as a group of Saudi arms dealers leading to Aitken s subsequent unsuccessful libel case and imprisonment for perjury  During this period  from 1988 to February 1998  Al Fayed s spokesman was Michael Cole  a former BBC journalist  although Cole s PR work for Al Fayed did not cease in 1998   Hamilton lost a subsequent libel action against Al Fayed in December 1999 and a subsequent appeal against the verdict in December 2000  The former MP has always denied that he was paid by Al Fayed for asking questions in parliament  Hamilton s libel action related to a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary broadcast on 16 January 1997 in which Al Fayed made claims that the MP had received up to £110 000 in cash and received other gratuities for asking parliamentary questions  Hamilton s basis for his appeal was that the original verdict was invalid because Al Fayed had paid £10 000 for documents stolen from the dustbins of Hamilton s legal representatives by Benjamin Pell  also known as  Benjy the Binman    In 2003  Fayed moved from Surrey  UK to Switzerland  alleging a breach in an agreement with Inland Revenue  In 2005  he moved back to Britain  saying that he  regards Britain as home   He moors a yacht in Monaco called the Sokar   2 3  Sale of Harrods  After previously denying that Harrods was for sale  Harrods was sold to Qatar Holdings  the sovereign wealth fund of the emirate of Qatar  on 10 May 2010  A fortnight previously  Fayed had stated that  People approach us from Kuwait  Saudi Arabia  Qatar  Fair enough  But I put two fingers up to them  It is not for sale  This is not Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury s  It is a special place that gives people pleasure  There is only one Mecca    Harrods was sold for £1 5 billion  Fayed later revealed in an interview that he decided to sell Harrods following the difficulty in getting his dividend approved by the trustee of the Harrods pension fund  Fayed said  I m here every day  I can t take my profit because I have to take a permission of those bloody idiots   I say is this right  Is this logic  Somebody like me  I run a business and I need to take bloody fucking trustee s permission to take my profit   Fayed was appointed honorary chairman of Harrods  a position he was scheduled to hold for at least six months   2 4  Scotland  In 1972  Fayed purchased the Balnagown estate in Easter Ross  Northern Scotland  From an initial twelve acres  Al Fayed has since built the estate up to sixty five thousand acres  Al Fayed has invested more than £20 million in the estate  restored the 14th century pink Balnagown Castle  and created a tourist accommodation business  The Highlands of Scotland tourist board awarded Al Fayed the  Freedom of the Highlands  in 2002  in recognition of his  outstanding contribution and commitment to the highlands    As an Egyptian with links to Scotland  Al Fayed was intrigued enough to fund a 2008 reprint of the 15th century chronicle Scotichronicon by Walter Bower  The Scotichronicon describes how Scota  a sister of the Egyptian Pharoh Tutankhamen  fled her family and landed in Scotland  bringing with her the Stone of Scone  According to the chronicle  Scotland was later named in her honour  The tale is disputed by modern historians  Al Fayed later declared that  The Scots are originally Egyptians and that s the truth    In 2009  Al Fayed revealed that he was a supporter of Scottish independence from the United Kingdom  announcing to the Scots that  It s time for you to waken up and detach yourselves from the English and their terrible politicians   whatever help is needed for Scotland to regain its independence  I will provide it   when you Scots regain your freedom  I am ready to be your president    2 5  Charity  Fayed set up the Al Fayed Charitable Foundation in 1987 aiming to help children with life limiting conditions and children living in poverty  The charity works mainly with charities and hospices for disabled and neglected children in the UK  Thailand and Mongolia   Some of the charities with which it works include Francis House Hospice in Manchester  Great Ormond Street Hospital and ChildLine  In 1998  Al Fayed bought Princess Diana s old boarding school in Kent and helped found the New School at West Heath for traumatised children there   In 2011  Mohamed Al Fayed s daughter Camilla  who has worked as an ambassador for the charity for eight years  opened the newly refurbished Zoe’s Place baby hospice in West Derby  Liverpool   2 6  Fulham F C   Al Fayed bought the freehold of West London professional football club Fulham F C  for £6 25 million in 1997  The club was purchased via Bill Muddyman s Muddyman Group  His long term aim was that Fulham would become a FA Premier League side within five years  In 2001  Fulham took the First Division  now Football League Championship  under manager Jean Tigana  winning 100 points and scoring over 100 goals in the season  This meant that Al Fayed had achieved his objective of Fulham being a Premiership club a year ahead of schedule  By 2002  Fulham were competing in European football  winning the Intertoto Cup and challenging in the UEFA Cup  Fulham have since continued to play in the Premiership  and reached the final of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League   Fulham temporarily left Craven Cottage while it was being upgraded to meet modern safety standards  There were fears that Fulham would not return to the Cottage  after it was revealed that Al Fayed had sold the first right to build on the ground to a property development firm   Fulham lost a legal case against former manager Tigana in 2004 after Al Fayed had wrongly alleged that Tigana had overpaid more than £7m for new players and had negotiated transfers in secret  In 2009 Al Fayed revealed that he was in favour of a wage cap for footballers  and criticised the management of The Football Association and Premier League as  run by donkeys who don t understand business  who are dazzled by money    A statue of the American entertainer Michael Jackson was unveiled by Al Fayed in April 2011 at Craven Cottage In 1999 Jackson had attended a league game against Wigan Athletic at the stadium  Following criticisms of the statue  Al Fayed said  If some stupid fans don t understand and appreciate such a gift this guy gave to the world they can go to hell  I don t want them to be fans   The statue was removed by the club s new owners in 2013  Al Fayed blamed the club s subsequent relegation from the Premier League on the  bad luck  brought by its removal  Al Fayed then donated the statue to the National Football Museum   Under Al Fayed Fulham F C  was owned by Mafco Holdings  based in the tax haven of Bermuda  Mafco Holdings is owned by Al Fayed and his family  By 2011  Al Fayed had loaned Fulham F C  £187 million in interest free loans  In July 2013  it was announced that Al Fayed had sold the club to American businessman Shahid Khan   3  Dodi s death  3 1  Romance with Diana  Princess of Wales  Lady Diana Spencer was born in 1961  and married the heir to the British throne  Charles  Prince of Wales in 1981  becoming the Princess of Wales  Diana was an international celebrity and a frequent visitor to Harrods in the 1980s  Al Fayed and Dodi first met Diana and Charles when they were introduced at a polo tournament in July 1986  that had been sponsored by Harrods   Diana and Charles divorced in 1996  Diana was hosted by Al Fayed in the south of France in the summer of 1997  with her two sons  the Princes William and Harry  For the holiday  Fayed bought a 195 ft yacht  the Jonikal  later renamed the Sokar   Dodi and Diana later began a private cruise on the Jonikal and paparazzi photographs of the couple in an embrace were published  Diana s friend  the journalist Richard Kay  confirmed that Diana was involved in  her first serious romance  since her divorce   Dodi and Diana went on a second private cruise on the Jonikal in the third week of August  and returned from Sardinia to Paris on the 30 August  The couple privately dined at the Ritz later that day  after the behaviour of the press caused them to cancel a restaurant reservation  they then planned to spend the night at Dodi s apartment near the Arc de Triomphe  In an attempt to deceive the paparazzi  a decoy car left the front of the hotel  while Diana and Dodi departed at speed in a Mercedes Benz W140 driven by chauffeur Henri Paul from the rear of the hotel  Five minutes later  the car crashed in the Pont de l Alma tunnel  killing Paul and Dodi  Diana died later in hospital  Fayed arrived in Paris the next day  and viewed Dodi s body  which was returned to Britain for an Islamic funeral   3 2  Conspiracy theories  From February 1998  Al Fayed claimed that the crash was a result of a conspiracy  and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by MI6 on the instructions of Prince Philip  Duke of Edinburgh  His claims that the crash was a result of a conspiracy were dismissed by a French judicial investigation  but Fayed appealed against this verdict  A libel action was brought against Al Fayed by Neil Hamilton  see above   During the questioning of one day of the hearing  which referred to Al Fayed s conspiracy theories  writer Martyn Gregory and a journalist from ITN counted 70 instances of Al Fayed saying  I don t know  or  I can t remember  to questions relating to the tragedy   The British Operation Paget  a Metropolitan police inquiry which concluded in 2006  also found no evidence of a conspiracy  To Operation Paget  Al Fayed made 175  conspiracy claims    An inquest headed by Lord Justice Scott Baker into the deaths of Diana and Dodi began at the Royal Courts of Justice  London  on 2 October 2007 and lasted for six months  It was a continuation of the original inquest that had begun in 2004   At the Scott Baker inquest Fayed accused The Duke of Edinburgh  The Prince of Wales and Lady Sarah McCorquodale  her sister  and numerous others  of plotting to kill the Princess of Wales  Their motive  he claimed  was that they could not tolerate the idea of the Princess marrying a Muslim   Al Fayed first claimed that the Princess was pregnant to the Daily Express in May 2001  and that he was the only person who had been told of this news  Witnesses at the inquest who said the Princess was not pregnant  and could not have been  were part of the conspiracy according to Al Fayed  Fayed s testimony at the inquest was roundly condemned in the press as being farcical  Members of the British Government s Intelligence and Security Committee accused Fayed of turning the inquest into a  circus  and called for it to be ended maturely  Lawyers representing Al Fayed later accepted at the inquest that there was no direct evidence that either the Duke of Edinburgh or MI6  had been involved in any murder conspiracy involving Diana or Dodi  A few days before Al Fayed s appearance  John Macnamara  a former senior detective at Scotland Yard and Al Fayed s investigator for five years from 1997  was forced to admit on 14 February 2008 that he had no evidence to suggest foul play  except for the assertions Al Fayed had made to him  His admissions also related to the lack of evidence for Al Fayed s claims about the alleged pregnancy of the Princess and the couple s supposed engagement   The jury verdict  given on 7 April 2008  was that Diana and Dodi had been  unlawfully killed  through the grossly negligent driving of chauffeur Henri Paul  who was intoxicated  and the paparazzi in control of the pursuing vehicles   Lawyers for Al Fayed also accepted that there was no evidence to support the assertion that Diana was illegally embalmed in order to cover up a pregnancy  a  pregnancy  which they accepted  could not be established by any medical evidence  They also accepted that there was no evidence to support the assertion the French emergency and medical services had played any role in a conspiracy to harm Diana  Following the Baker inquest  Al Fayed said that he was abandoning his campaign to prove that Diana and Dodi were murdered in a conspiracy  and said that he would accept the verdict of the jury   Al Fayed financially supported Unlawful Killing  2011   a documentary film accused of presenting his version of events  The film was not formally released as a result of legal
