This article is about the demographic features of the population of Romania  including population density  ethnicity  education level  health of the populace  economic status  religious affiliations and other aspects of the population   About 89 4% of the people of Romania are ethnic Romanians  whose language  Romanian  is an Eastern Romance language  descended primarily from Latin with some Bulgarian  Serbian  German  Greek  Hungarian and Turkish borrowings  Romanians are by far the most numerous group of speakers of an Eastern Romance language today  It has been said that they constitute  an island of Latinity  in Eastern Europe  surrounded on all sides either by Slavic peoples or by the Hungarians   The Hungarian minority in Romania constitutes the country s largest minority  6 5 per cent of the population   1  Population  Sources give varied estimates for Romania s historical population  The National Institute for Research and Development in Informatics  NIRDI  gives the following numbers   1 1  Population evolution  See also Demographic history of Romania  The following numbers  very different for the early years  come from the Tacitus Historical Atlas  1844 — 3 6 million  1861 — 3 9 million  1870 — 4 3 million  1880 — 4 5 million  1890 — 5 3 million  1900 — 6 0 million  1910 — 6 9 million  1915 — 7 8 million  1921 — 15 6 million  1930 — 17 9 million  1939 — 19 9 million  1940 — 15 9 million  1941 — 13 6 million  1946 — 15 8 million Thereafter  the numbers are essentially the same as the NIRDI numbers   See also Demographic history of Romania    2  Ethnic groups  Before World War II  minorities represented more than 28% of the total population  During the war that percentage was halved  largely by the loss of the border areas of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina  to the former Soviet Union  now Moldova and Ukraine  and southern Dobrudja  to Bulgaria   Two thirds of the ethnic German population either left or were deported after World War II  a period that was followed by decades of relatively regular  by communist standards  migration  All these left behind a population of 60 000 ethnic Germans in Romania today  Of a total official population of over three quarter million Jews before World War II  more than half were killed during the Holocaust  Mass emigration  mostly to Israel and United States  has reduced the surviving Jewish community to less than 6 000 in 2002 it is estimated that the real numbers could be 3 4 times higher    Hungarians  Magyars  see Hungarians in Romania   especially in Harghita  Covasna  and Mureş counties  and the Roma are the principal minorities  with a declining German population  Banat Swabians in Timiş  Transylvanian Saxons in Sibiu  Braşov and elsewhere   and smaller numbers of Czechs  Slovaks  Serbs  Chinese  Croats  and Banat Bulgarians  in Banat   Ukrainians  especially in Maramureş and Bukovina   Greeks of Romania  especially in Brăila and Constanţa   Turks and Tatars  mainly in Constanţa   Armenians  Russians  Lipovans  Old Believers in Tulcea   Jews and others  Since the Romanian Revolution of 1989  Bucharest has again become an increasingly cosmopolitan city  including identifiable Chinese and Irish presences  Minority populations are greatest in Transylvania and the Banat  areas in the north and west of the country  which were possessions of the Habsburg Empire  after 1867 the Austria Hungary  until World War I  Even before the union with Romania  ethnic Romanians comprised the overall majority in Transylvania  However  ethnic Hungarians and Germans were the dominant urban population until relatively recently  while Hungarians still constitute the majority in Harghita and Covasna counties   3  Vital statistics  3 1  Before WWI  3 2  Between WWI
