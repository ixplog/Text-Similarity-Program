Jerome Klapka Jerome  2 May 1859 – 14 June 1927  was an English writer and humourist  best known for the comic travelogue Three Men in a Boat  1889    Other works include the essay collections Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow  1886  and Second Thoughts of an Idle Fellow  Three Men on the Bummel  a sequel to Three Men in a Boat  and several other novels   1  Early life  Jerome was born in Caldmore  Walsall  England  He was the fourth child of Marguerite Jones and Jerome Clapp  who later renamed himself Jerome Clapp Jerome   an ironmonger and lay preacher who dabbled in architecture  He had two sisters  Paulina and Blandina  and one brother  Milton  who died at an early age  Jerome was registered  like his father s amended name  as Jerome Clapp Jerome  and the Klapka appears to be a later variation  after the exiled Hungarian general György Klapka   Owing to bad investments in the local mining industry  the family fell into poverty and debt collectors visited often  an experience Jerome described vividly in his autobiography My Life and Times  1926   The young Jerome attended St Marylebone Grammar School  He wished to go into politics or be a man of letters  but the death of his father when the younger Jerome was age 13 and of his mother when he was age 15 forced him to quit his studies and find work to support himself  He was employed at the London and North Western Railway  initially collecting coal that fell along the railway  and remained there for four years   2  Acting career and early literary works  In 1877  inspired by his older sister Blandina s love for the theatre  Jerome decided to try his hand at acting  under the stage name Harold Crichton  He joined a repertory troupe that produced plays on a shoestring budget  often drawing on the actors  own meagre resources – Jerome was penniless at the time – to purchase costumes and props  After three years on the road with no evident success  the 21 year old Jerome decided he had had enough of stage life and sought other occupations  He tried to become a journalist  writing essays  satires and short stories  but most of these were rejected  Over the next few years he was a school teacher  a packer  and a solicitor s clerk  Finally  in 1885  he had some success with On the Stage — and Off  1885   a comic memoir of his experiences with the acting troupe  followed by Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow  1886   a collection of humorous essays which had previously appeared in the newly founded magazine  Home Chimes  the same magazine that would later serialise Three Men in a Boat  On 21 June 1888  Jerome married Georgina Elizabeth Henrietta Stanley Marris   Ettie    nine days after she divorced her first husband  She had a daughter from her previous  five year marriage nicknamed Elsie  her actual name was also Georgina   The honeymoon took place on the Thames  in a little boat   a fact that was to have a significant influence on his next  and most important work  Three Men in a Boat   3  Three Men in a Boat and later career  Jerome sat down to write Three Men in a Boat as soon as the couple returned from their honeymoon  In the novel  his wife was replaced by his longtime friends George Wingrave  George  and Carl Hentschel  Harris   This allowed him to create comic  and non sentimental  situations which were nonetheless intertwined with the history of the Thames region  The book  published in 1889  became an instant success and is still in print  Its popularity was such that the number of registered Thames boats went up fifty percent in the year following its publication  and it contributed significantly to the Thames becoming a tourist attraction   In its first twenty years alone  the book sold over a million copies worldwide  It has been adapted to films  TV and radio shows  stage plays  and even a musical  Its writing style influenced many humorists and satirists in England and elsewhere   With the financial security the sales of the book provided  Jerome was able to dedicate all of his time to writing  He wrote a number of plays  essays and novels  but was never able to recapture the success of Three Men in a Boat  In 1892 he was chosen by Robert Barr to edit The Idler  over Rudyard Kipling   The magazine was an illustrated satirical monthly catering to gentlemen  who  following the theme of the publication  appreciated idleness   In 1893 he founded To Day  but had to withdraw from both publications because of financial difficulties and a libel suit   In 1898  a short stay in Germany inspired Three Men on the Bummel  the sequel to Three Men in a Boat  While reintroducing the same characters in the setting of a foreign bicycle tour  the book was nonetheless unable to capture the life force and historic roots of its predecessor  and it enjoyed only a mild success  In 1902 he published the novel Paul Kelver  which is widely regarded as autobiographical  His 1908 play The Passing of the Third Floor Back introduced a more sombre and religious Jerome  The main character was played by one of the leading actors of the time  Johnston Forbes Robertson and the play was a tremendous commercial success  It was to be twice made into a film  in 1918 and in 1935   However  the play was condemned by critics – Max Beerbohm described it as  vilely stupid  and as written by a  tenth rate writer    4  World War I and last years  Jerome volunteered to serve his country at the outbreak of the war  but  being 56 years old  was rejected by the British Army  Eager to serve in some capacity  he volunteered as an ambulance driver for the French Army   In 1926  Jerome published his autobiography  My Life and Times  Shortly afterwards  the Borough of Walsall conferred on him the title Freeman of the Borough  During these last years  Jerome spent more time at his farmhouse in Ewelme near Wallingford   In June 1927  on a motoring tour from Devon to London via Cheltenham and Northampton  Jerome suffered a paralytic stroke and a cerebral haemorrhage  He lay in Northampton General Hospital for two weeks before succumbing on 14 June  He was cremated at Golders Green and his ashes buried at St Mary s Church  Ewelme  Oxfordshire  Elsie  Ettie  and his sister Blandina are buried beside him  A small museum dedicated to his life and works was opened in 1984 at his birth home in Walsall  but it closed in 2008  and the contents were returned to Walsall Museum   5  Legacy  There is a French graphic novel series named Jérôme K  Jérôme Bloche after the author   A museum was opened in Walsall  his birthplace  in his honour in 1984   closed 2008    A sculpture of a boat and a mosaic of a dog commemorate his book Three Men in a Boat on the Millennium Green in New Southgate  London  where he lived as a child   6  Bibliography
