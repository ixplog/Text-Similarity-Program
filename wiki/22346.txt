Observational error  or measurement error  is the difference between a measured value of quantity and its true value  In statistics  an error is not a  mistake   Variability is an inherent part of things being measured and of the measurement process   1  Science and experiments  When either randomness or uncertainty modeled by probability theory is attributed to such errors  they are  errors  in the sense in which that term is used in statistics  see errors and residuals in statistics   Every time we repeat a measurement with a sensitive instrument  we obtain slightly different results  The common statistical model we use is that the error has two additive parts   systematic error which always occurs  with the same value  when we use the instrument in the same way and in the same case  and  random error which may vary from observation to observation  Systematic error is sometimes called statistical bias  It may often be reduced by very carefully standardized procedures  Part of the education in every science is how to use the standard instruments of the discipline   The random error  or random variation  is due to factors which we cannot  or do not  control  It may be too expensive or we may be too ignorant of these factors to control them each time we measure  It may even be that whatever we are trying to measure is changing in time  see dynamic models   or is fundamentally probabilistic  as is the case in quantum mechanics    see Measurement in quantum mechanics   Random error often occurs when instruments are pushed to their limits  For example  it is common for digital balances to exhibit random error in their least significant digit  Three measurements of a single object might read something like 0 9111g  0 9110g  and 0 9112g   2  Surveys  The term observational error is also sometimes used to refer to response errors and some other types of non sampling error  In survey type situations  these errors can be mistakes in the collection of data  including both the incorrect recording of a response and the correct recording of a respondent s inaccurate response   3  See also  Errors and residuals in statistics  Error  Replication  statistics   Statistical theory  Metrology  Regression dilution  Test method  Propagation of uncertainty  Instrument error  Measurement uncertainty  4  References  Errors of Measurement in Statistics  W  G  Cochran  Technometrics  Vol  10  No  4  Nov   1968   pp  637 666    www jstor org stable 1267450
