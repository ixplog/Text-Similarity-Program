A villanelle  also known as villanesque  is a nineteen line poetic form consisting of five tercets followed by a quatrain  There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes  with the first and third line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza  which includes both repeated lines  The villanelle is an example of a fixed verse form  The word derives from Latin  then Italian  and is related to the initial subject of the form being the pastoral   The form started as a simple ballad like song with no fixed form  this fixed quality would only come much later  from the poem  Villanelle  J ay perdu ma Tourterelle    1606  by Jean Passerat  From this point  its evolution into the  fixed form  used in the present day is debated  Despite its French origins  the majority of villanelles have been written in English  a trend which began in the late nineteenth century  The villanelle has been noted as a form that frequently treats the subject of obsessions  and one which appeals to outsiders  its defining feature of repetition prevents it from having a conventional tone   1  Etymology  The word villanelle derives from the Italian villanella  referring to a rustic song or dance  and which comes from villano  meaning peasant or villein  Villano derives from the Medieval Latin villanus  meaning a  farmhand   The etymology of the word relates to the fact that the form s initial distinguishing feature was the pastoral subject   2  History  The villanelle originated as a simple ballad like song—in imitation of peasant songs of an oral tradition—with no fixed poetic form  These poems were often of a rustic or pastoral subject matter and contained refrains  Prior to the nineteenth century  the term would have simply meant country song  with no particular form implied — a meaning it retains in the vocabulary of early music  According to Julie Kane  the refrain in each stanza indicates that the form descended from a  choral dance song  wherein a vocal soloist—frequently female—semi improvised the  unique  lyrics of each stanza  while a ring of dancers—all female  or male and female mixed—chimed in with the repetitive words of the refrain as they danced around her in a circle    The fixed form villanelle  containing the nineteen line dual refrain  derives from Jean Passerat s poem  Villanelle  J ay perdu ma Tourterelle    published in 1606  The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics  1993  suggests that this became the standard  villanelle  when prosodists such as César Pierre Richelet based their definitions of the form on that poem  This conclusion is refuted by Kane  however  who argues that it was instead Pierre Charles Berthelin s additions to Richelet s Dictionnaire de rimes that first fixed the form  followed a century later by the poet Théodore de Banville  his creation of a parody to Passerat s  J ay perdu      would lead Wilhelm Ténint and others to think that the villanelle was an antique form   Despite its classification and origin as a French poetic form  by far the majority of villanelles have been written in English  Subsequent to the publication of Théodore de Banville s treatise on prosody  Petit traité de poésie française   1872   the form became popularised in England through Edmund Gosse and Austin Dobson  Gosse  Dobson  Oscar Wilde  Andrew Lang and John Payne were among the first English practitioners—theirs and other works were published in Gleeson White s Ballades and Rondeaus  Chants Royal  Sestinas  Villanelles  &c  Selected  1887   which contained thirty two English language villanelles composed by nineteen poets   Most modernists disdained the villanelle  which became associated with the overwrought formal aestheticism of the 1890s  i e   the decadent movement in England  In his 1914 novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man  James Joyce includes a villanelle written by his protagonist Stephen Dedalus  William Empson revived the villanelle more seriously in the 1930s  and his contemporaries and friends W  H  Auden and Dylan Thomas also picked up the form  Dylan Thomas s  Do not go gentle into that good night  is perhaps the most renowned villanelle of all  Theodore Roethke and Sylvia Plath wrote villanelles in the 1950s and 1960s  and Elizabeth Bishop wrote a particularly famous and influential villanelle   One Art   in 1976  The villanelle reached an unprecedented level of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of the New Formalism  Since then  many contemporary poets have written villanelles  and they have often varied the form in innovative ways  in their anthology of villanelles  Villanelles   Annie Fitch and Marie Elizabeth Mali devote a section entitled  Variations on the Villanelle  to such innovations   3  Form  The villanelle consists of five stanzas of three lines  tercets  followed by a single stanza of four lines  a quatrain  for a total of nineteen lines  It is structured by two repeating rhymes and two refrains  the first line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the second and fourth stanzas  and the third line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the third and fifth stanzas  The rhyme and refrain pattern of the villanelle can be schematized as A1bA2 abA1 abA2 abA1 abA2 abA1A2 where letters   a  and  b   indicate the two rhyme sounds  upper case indicates a refrain   A    and superscript numerals  1 and 2  indicate Refrain 1 and Refrain 2   The pattern is below set against  Do not go gentle into that good night  by Dylan Thomas   The villanelle has no established meter  although most 19th century villanelles have used trimeter or tetrameter and most 20th century villanelles have used pentameter  Slight alteration of the refrain line is permissible   4  Effect  With reference to the form s repetition of lines  Philip K  Jason suggests that the  villanelle is often used  and properly used  to deal with one or another degree of obsession  citing Sylvia Plath s  Mad Girl s Love Song  amongst other examples  He notes the possibility for the form to evoke  through the relationship between the repeated lines  a feeling of dislocation and a  paradigm for schizophrenia   This repetition of lines has been considered to prevent villanelles from possessing a  conventional tone  and that instead they are closer in form to a song or lyric poetry  Stephen Fry says that the villanelle  is a form that seems to appeal to outsiders  or those who might have cause to consider themselves as such   having a  playful artifice  which suits  rueful  ironic reiteration of pain or fatalism   In spite of this  the villanelle has also often been used for light verse  as for instance Louis Untermeyer s  Lugubrious Villanelle of Platitudes    On the relationship between form and content  Anne Ridler noted in an introduction to her own poem  Villanelle for the Middle of the Way  a point made by T  S  Eliot  that  to use very strict form is a help  because you concentrate on the technical difficulties of mastering the form  and allow the content of the poem a more unconscious and freer release   In an introduction to his own take on the form entitled  Missing Dates   William Empson suggested that while the villanelle is a  very rigid form   W  H  Auden—in his long poem The Sea and the Mirror—had nonetheless  made it sound absolutely natural like the innocent girl talking    5  Examples   Do not go gentle into that good night  by Dylan Thomas  Probably the best known villanelle in English    The Waking  by Theodore Roethke    Mad
