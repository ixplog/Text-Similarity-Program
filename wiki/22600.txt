Optical brighteners  optical brightening agents  OBAs   fluorescent brightening agents  FBAs  or fluorescent whitening agents  FWAs  are chemical compounds that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region  usually 340 370 nm  of the electromagnetic spectrum  and re emit light in the blue region  typically 420 470 nm   Fluorescent activity is a short term or rapid emission response  unlike phosphorescence  which is a delayed emission  These additives are often used to enhance the appearance of color of fabric and paper  causing a  whitening  effect  making materials look less yellow by increasing the overall amount of blue light reflected   1  Properties  The most common classes of chemicals with this property are the stilbenes and older  non commercial fluorescent chemical such as umbelliferone  which absorb energy in the UV portion of the spectrum and re emit it in the blue portion of the visible spectrum  A white surface treated with an optical brightener can emit more visible light than that which shines on it  making it appear brighter  The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white   There are approximately 400 brightener types listed in the Colour Index  but less than 90 are actually produced commercially and only a handful are commercially important  Generically  the C I  FBA number can be assigned to a specific molecule  however  some are duplicated  since manufacturers apply for the index number when they produce it  The global OBA production for paper  textiles and detergents is dominated by just a few di  and tetra sulfonated triazole stilbenes and a di sulfonated stilbene biphenyl  These are subject to fading when exposed long term to UV  due to the formation of optically inactive stilbene cis isomers found at the center of the molecule  Exposed to gases and especially oxygen they will fade too  like most dye colorants  All brighteners have extended conjugation and or aromaticity  allowing for electron movement  Some non stilbene brighteners are used in more permanent applications such as whitening synthetic fiber   Brighteners can be  boosted  by the addition of certain polyols like high molecular weight polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl alcohol  These additives increase the visible blue light emissions significantly  Brighteners can also be  quenched   Too much use of brightener will often cause a greening effect as emissions start to show above the blue region in the visible spectrum  Besides the formation of cis isomer in stilbene containing brighteners  only the trans isomer is optically active   continued exposure to UV containing light will actually cleave the molecule and start the process of degradation   2  Common uses  Brighteners are commonly added to laundry detergents to replace whitening agents removed during washing and to make the clothes appear cleaner  Optical brighteners have replaced bluing which was formerly used to produce the same effect  Some brighteners can cause allergic reactions when in contact with skin  depending on the individual   Brighteners are used in many papers  especially high brightness papers  resulting in their strongly fluorescent appearance under UV illumination  Paper brightness is typically measured at 457 nm  well within the fluorescent activity range of brighteners  Paper used for banknotes does not contain optical brighteners  so a common method for detecting counterfeit notes is to check for fluorescence   Optical brighteners have also found use in cosmetics  One application is to formulas for washing and conditioning grey or blonde hair  where the brightener can not only increase the luminance and sparkle of the hair  but can also correct dull  yellowish discoloration without darkening the hair  Some advanced face and eye powders contain optical brightener microspheres that brighten shadowed or dark areas of the skin  such as  tired eyes    A side effect of textile optical whitening is to make the treated fabrics more visible with Night Vision Devices than non treated ones  This may or may not be desirable for military or other applications  Optically brightened paper is often not useful in exacting photographic or art applications  since the whiteness decreases with time   End uses of optical brighteners include   Detergent whitener  instead of bluing agents   Paper brightening  internal or in a coating   Fiber whitening  internal  added to polymer melts   Textile whitening  external  added to fabric finishes   Color correcting or brightening additive in advanced cosmetic formulas  shampoos  conditioners  eye makeup   3  References
