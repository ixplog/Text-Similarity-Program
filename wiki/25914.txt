Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich     7 March 1904 – 4 June 1942  was a high ranking German Nazi official during World War II  and one of the main architects of the Holocaust  He was SS Obergruppenführer  General  and General der Polizei  chief of the Reich Main Security Office  including the Gestapo  Kripo  and SD  and Stellvertretender Reichsprotektor  Deputy Acting Reich Protector  of Bohemia and Moravia  in what is now the Czech Republic   Heydrich served as President of Interpol  the international law enforcement agency  and chaired the January 1942 Wannsee Conference  which formalised plans for the final solution to the Jewish Question—the deportation and extermination of all Jews in German occupied territory   Historians regard him as the darkest figure within the Nazi elite  Adolf Hitler described him as  the man with the iron heart   He was the founding head of the Sicherheitsdienst  SD   an intelligence organisation charged with seeking out and neutralising resistance to the Nazi Party via arrests  deportations  and killings  He helped organise Kristallnacht  a series of co ordinated attacks against Jews throughout Nazi Germany and parts of Austria on 9–10 November 1938  The attacks  carried out by SA stormtroopers and civilians  presaged the Holocaust  Upon his arrival in Prague  Heydrich sought to eliminate opposition to the Nazi occupation by suppressing Czech culture and deporting and executing members of the Czech resistance  He was directly responsible for the Einsatzgruppen  the special task forces which travelled in the wake of the German armies and killed over one million people  including Jews  by mass shooting   Heydrich was attacked in Prague on 27 May 1942 by a British trained team of Czech and Slovak soldiers who had been sent by the Czechoslovak government in exile to kill him in Operation Anthropoid  He died from his injuries a week later  Intelligence falsely linked the assassins to the villages of Lidice and Ležáky  Lidice was razed to the ground  all men and boys over the age of 16 were murdered  and all but a handful of its women and children were deported and killed in Nazi concentration camps   1  Early life  Heydrich was born in 1904 in Halle an der Saale to composer and opera singer Richard Bruno Heydrich and his wife Elisabeth Anna Maria Amalia Krantz  His mother was Roman Catholic  His two forenames were patriotic musical tributes   Reinhard  referred to the tragic hero from Amen  an opera his father wrote   and  Tristan  stems from Richard Wagner s Tristan und Isolde  Heydrich s third name   Eugen   was his late maternal grandfather s forename  Professor Eugen Krantz had been the director of the Dresden Royal Conservatory   Heydrich was born into a family of social standing and substantial financial means  Music was a part of Heydrich s everyday life  his father founded the Halle Conservatory of Music and his mother taught piano there  Heydrich developed a passion for the violin and carried that interest into adulthood  he impressed listeners with his musical talent   His father was a German nationalist who instilled patriotic ideas in his three children  but was not affiliated with any political party until after World War I  The Heydrich household was strict  As a youth  he engaged his younger brother  Heinz  in mock fencing duels  Heydrich was very intelligent and excelled in his schoolwork—especially in science—at the  Reformgymnasium   A talented athlete  he became an expert swimmer and fencer  He was shy  insecure  and was frequently bullied for his high pitched voice and rumoured Jewish ancestry  The latter claim earned him the nickname  Moses Handel    In 1918  World War I ended with Germany s defeat  In late February 1919  civil unrest—including strikes and clashes between communist and anti communist groups—took place in Heydrich s home town of Halle  Under Defence Minister Gustav Noske s directives  a right wing paramilitary unit was formed and ordered to  recapture  Halle  Heydrich  then 15 years old  joined Maercker s Volunteer Rifles  the first Freikorps unit   When the skirmishes ended  Heydrich was part of the force assigned to protect private property  Little is known about his role  but the events left a strong impression  it was a  political awakening  for him  He joined the Deutschvölkischer Schutz und Trutzbund  National German Protection and Shelter League   an anti Semitic organisation   As a result of the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles  hyperinflation spread across Germany and many lost their life savings  Halle was not spared  By 1921  few townspeople there could afford a musical education at Bruno Heydrich s conservatory  This led to a financial crisis for the Heydrich family   2  Naval career  In 1922 Heydrich joined the Reichsmarine  taking advantage of the security  structure  and pension it offered  He became a naval cadet at Kiel  Germany s primary naval base  On 1 April 1924 he was promoted to senior midshipman  Oberfähnrich zur See  and sent to officer training at the Mürwik Naval College  In 1926 he advanced to the rank of ensign  Leutnant zur See  and was assigned as a signals officer on the battleship   the flagship of Germany s North Sea Fleet  With the promotion came greater recognition  He received good evaluations from his superiors and had few problems with other crewmen  He was promoted on 1 July 1928 to the rank of sub lieutenant  Oberleutnant zur See   The increased rank fuelled his ambition and arrogance   Heydrich became notorious for his countless affairs  In December 1930 he attended a rowing club ball and met Lina von Osten  They became romantically involved and soon announced their engagement  Lina was already a Nazi Party follower  she had attended her first rally in 1929  In 1931 Heydrich was charged with  conduct unbecoming to an officer and gentleman  for breaking an engagement promise to a woman he had known for six months before the von Osten engagement  Admiral Erich Raeder dismissed Heydrich from the navy that April  The dismissal devastated Heydrich  who found himself without career prospects  He kept the engagement and married Lina in December 1931   3  Career in the SS and military  In 1931  Heinrich Himmler began setting up a counterintelligence division of the SS  Acting on the advice of his associate Karl von Eberstein  who was von Osten s friend  Himmler interviewed Heydrich  Himmler was impressed and hired him immediately  His pay was 180 reichsmarks per month  40 USD   His NSDAP number was 544 916 and his SS number was 10 120  Heydrich later received a Totenkopfring from Himmler for his service   On 1 August 1931 Heydrich began his job as chief of the new  Ic Service   intelligence service   He set up office at the Brown House  the Nazi Party headquarters in Munich  By October he had created a network of spies and informers for intelligence gathering purposes and to obtain information to be used as blackmail to further political aims  Information on thousands of people was recorded on index cards and stored at the Brown House  To mark the occasion of Heydrich s December wedding  Himmler promoted him to the rank of SS Sturmbannführer  major   In just over fifteen months  Heydrich had surpassed his former naval rank and was making what was considered a  comfortable  salary   In 1932 Heydrich s enemies began to spread rumours of his alleged Jewish ancestry  Wilhelm Canaris said he had obtained photocopies proving Heydrich s Jewish ancestry  but these photocopies never surfaced  Nazi Gauleiter Rudolf Jordan also claimed that Heydrich was not a pure Aryan  Within the Nazi organisation such innuendo could be damning  even for the head of the Reich s counterintelligence service  Gregor Strasser passed the allegations on to Nazi Party racial expert Dr  Achim Gercke who investigated Heydrich s genealogy  Gercke reported that Heydrich was      of German origin and free from any coloured and Jewish blood   He insisted that the rumours were baseless  Even with this report  Heydrich privately engaged SD member Ernst Hoffman to further investigate and dispel the rumours   3 1  Gestapo and SD  In mid 1932  Himmler appointed Heydrich chief of the renamed security service—the Sicherheitsdienst  SD   Heydrich s counterintelligence service grew into an effective machine of terror and intimidation  With Hitler striving for absolute power in Germany  Himmler and Heydrich wished to control the political police forces of all 17 German states  They began with Bavaria  In 1933  Heydrich gathered some of his men from the SD and together they stormed police headquarters in Munich and took over the police using intimidation tactics  Himmler became the Munich police chief and Heydrich became the commander of Department IV  the political police   In 1933  Hitler became Chancellor of Germany  and through a series of decrees became Germany s Führer und Reichskanzler  leader and chancellor   The first concentration camps  which were originally intended to house political opponents  were established in early 1933  By year s end there were over fifty camps   Hermann Göring founded the Gestapo in 1933 as a Prussian police force  When Göring transferred full authority over the Gestapo to Himmler in April 1934  it immediately became an instrument of terror under the SS s purview  Himmler named Heydrich to head the Gestapo on 22 April 1934  On 9 June 1934  Rudolph Hess declared the SD the official Nazi intelligence service   3 2  Crushing the SA  Beginning in April 1934  and at Hitler s request  Heydrich and Himmler began building a dossier on Sturmabteilung  SA  leader Ernst Röhm in an effort to remove him as a rival for party leadership  At this point  the SS was still part of the SA  the early Nazi paramilitary organisation which now numbered over 3 million men  At Hitler s direction  Heydrich  Himmler  Göring  and Viktor Lutze drew up lists of those who should be liquidated  starting with seven top SA officials and including many more  On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days  Röhm was shot without trial  along with the leadership of the SA  The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives  Up to 200 people were killed in the action  Lutze was appointed SA s new head and it was converted into a sports and training organisation   With the SA out of the way  Heydrich began building the Gestapo into an instrument of fear  He improved his index card system  creating categories of offenders with colour coded cards  The Gestapo had the authority to arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime  and the definition of a crime was at their discretion  The Gestapo Law  passed in 1936  gave police the right to act extra legally  This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft— protective custody   a euphemism for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings  The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere  The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally as long as it was carrying out the leadership s will  People were arrested arbitrarily  sent to concentration camps  or killed   Himmler began developing the notion of a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church  In early 1936  Heydrich left the Catholic Church  His wife  Lina  had already done so the year before  Heydrich not only felt he could no longer be a member  but came to consider the church s political power and influence a danger to the state   3 3  Consolidating the police forces  On 17 June 1936 all police forces throughout Germany were united  following Hitler s appointment of Himmler as Chief of German Police  With this appointment by the Führer  Himmler and his deputy  Heydrich  became two of the most powerful men in the internal administration of Germany  Himmler immediately reorganised the police into two groups  the Ordnungspolizei  Order Police  Orpo   consisting of both the national uniformed police and the municipal police  and the Sicherheitspolizei  Security Police  SiPo   consisting of the Geheime StaatsPolizei  Secret State Police  Gestapo  and Kriminalpolizei  Criminal Police  Kripo   At that point  Heydrich was head of the SiPo and SD  Heinrich Müller was the Gestapo s operations chief   Heydrich was assigned to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin  The games were used to promote the propaganda aims of the Nazi regime  Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering a boycott  Anti Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration  and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of Der Stuermer  For his part in the games  success  Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German Olympic Games Decoration  First Class    In January 1937 Heydrich directed the SD to secretly begin collecting and analysing public opinion and report back their findings  He then had the Gestapo carry out house searches  arrests  and interrogations  thus in effect exercising control over public opinion  In February 1938 when the Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg resisted Hitler s proposed merger with Germany  Heydrich intensified the pressure on Austria by organising Nazi demonstrations and distributing propaganda in Vienna stressing the common Germanic blood of the two countries  In the Anschluss on 12 March  Hitler declared the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany   In mid 1939 Heydrich created the Stiftung Nordhav Foundation to obtain real estate for the SS and Security Police to use as guest houses and vacation spots  The Wannsee Villa  which the Stiftung Nordhav acquired in November 1940  was the site of the Wannsee Conference  20 January 1942   At the conference  senior Nazi officials formalised plans to deport and exterminate all Jews in German occupied territory and those countries not yet conquered  This action was to be coordinated among the representatives from the Nazi state agencies present at the meeting   On 27 September 1939 the SD and SiPo  made up of the Gestapo and the Kripo  were folded into the new Reich Main Security Office or SS Reichssicherheitshauptamt  RSHA   which was placed under Heydrich s control  The title of  Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD   Chief of Security Police and SD  or CSSD was conferred on Heydrich on 1 October  Heydrich became the President of Interpol  then under Nazi control  on 24 August 1940  and its headquarters were transferred to Berlin  He was promoted to SS Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei on 24 September 1941   3 4  Red Army purges  In 1936  Heydrich learned that a top ranking Soviet officer was plotting to overthrow Joseph Stalin  Sensing an opportunity to strike a blow at both the Soviet Army and Admiral Canaris of Germany s Abwehr  Heydrich decided that the Russian officers should be  unmasked   He discussed the matter with Himmler and both in turn brought it to Hitler s attention  But the  information  Heydrich had received was actually misinformation planted by Stalin himself in an attempt to legitimise his planned purges of the Red Army s high command  Stalin ordered one of his best NKVD agents  General Nikolai Skoblin  to pass Heydrich false information suggesting that Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other Soviet generals were plotting against Stalin  Hitler approved Heydrich s plan to act on the information immediately  Heydrich s SD forged documents and letters implicated Tukhachevsky and other Red Army commanders  The material was delivered to the NKVD  The Great Purge of the Red Army followed on Stalin s orders  While Heydrich believed they had successfully deluded Stalin into executing or dismissing 35 000 of his officer corps  the importance of Heydrich s part is a matter of speculation and conjecture  Soviet military prosecutors did not use the forged documents against the generals in their secret trial  they instead relied on false confessions extorted or beaten out of the defendants   3 5  Night and Fog decree  By late 1940  German armies had swept through most of Western Europe  The following year  Heydrich s SD was given responsibility for carrying out the Nacht und Nebel  Night and Fog  decree  According to the decree   persons endangering German security  were to be arrested in a maximally discreet way   under the cover of night and fog   People disappeared without a trace and none told of their whereabouts or fate  For each prisoner  the SD had to fill in a questionnaire that listed personal information  country of origin  and the details of their crimes against the Reich  This questionnaire was placed in an envelope inscribed with a seal reading  Nacht und Nebel  and submitted to the Reich Main Security Office  RSHA   In the WVHA  Central Inmate File   as in many camp files  these prisoners would be given a special  covert prisoner  code  as opposed to the code for POW  Felon  Jew  Gypsy  etc  The decree remained in effect after Heydrich s death  The exact number of people who vanished under it has never been positively established  but it is estimated to be 7 000   3 6  Acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia  On 27 September 1941  Heydrich was appointed Deputy Reich Protector of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia  the part of Czechoslovakia incorporated into the Reich on 15 March 1939  and assumed control of the territory  The Reich Protector  Konstantin von Neurath  remained the territory s titular head  but was sent on  leave  because Hitler  Himmler  and Heydrich felt his  soft approach  to the Czechs had promoted anti German sentiment and encouraged anti German resistance via strikes and sabotage  Upon his appointment  Heydrich told his aides   We will Germanize the Czech vermin    Heydrich came to Prague to enforce policy  fight resistance to the Nazi regime  and keep up production quotas of Czech motors and arms that were  extremely important to the German war effort   He viewed the area as a bulwark of Germandom and condemned the Czech resistance s  stabs in the back   To realise his goals Heydrich demanded racial classification of those who could and could not be Germanized  He explained   Making this Czech garbage into Germans must give way to methods based on racist thought   Heydrich started his rule by terrorising the population  92 people were executed within three days of his arrival in Prague  Their names appeared on posters throughout the occupied region  Almost all avenues by which Czechs could express the Czech culture in public were closed  According to Heydrich s estimate  between 4 000 and 5 000 people were arrested by February 1942  Those who were not executed were sent to Mauthausen Gusen concentration camp  where only four per cent of Czech prisoners survived the war  In March 1942  further sweeps against Czech cultural and patriotic organisations  military  and intelligentsia resulted in the practical paralysis of Czech resistance  Although small disorganised cells of Central Leadership of Home Resistance  Ústřední vedení odboje domácího  ÚVOD  survived  only the communist resistance was able to function in a coordinated manner  although it also suffered arrests   The terror also served to paralyse resistance in society  with public and widespread reprisals against any action resisting the German rule  Heydrich s brutal policies during that time quickly earned him the nickname  the Butcher of Prague    As Acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia  Heydrich applied carrot and stick methods  Labour was reorganised on the basis of the German Labour Front  Heydrich used equipment confiscated from the Czech organisation Sokol to organise events for workers  Food rations and free shoes were distributed  pensions were increased  and  for a time  free Saturdays were introduced  Unemployment insurance was established for the first time  The black market was suppressed  Those associated with it or the resistance movement were tortured or executed  Heydrich labelled them  economic criminals  and  enemies of the people   which helped gain him support  Conditions in Prague and the rest of the Czech lands were relatively peaceful under Heydrich  and industrial output increased  Still  those measures could not hide shortages and increasing inflation  reports of growing discontent multiplied   Despite public displays of goodwill towards the populace  privately Heydrich left no illusions about his eventual goal   This entire area will one day be definitely German  and the Czechs have nothing to expect here   Eventually up to two thirds of the populace were to be either removed to regions of Russia or exterminated after Nazi Germany won the war  Bohemia and Moravia faced annexation directly into the German Reich   The Czech workforce was exploited as Nazi conscripted labour  More than 100 000 workers were removed from  unsuitable  jobs and conscripted by the Ministry of Labour  By December 1941  Czechs could be called to work anywhere within the Reich  Between April and November 1942  79 000 Czech workers were taken in this manner for work within Nazi Germany  Also  in February 1942  the work day was increased from eight to twelve hours   Heydrich was  for all intents and purposes  military dictator of Bohemia and Moravia  His changes to the government s structure left President Emil Hacha and his cabinet virtually powerless  He often drove alone in a car with an open roof—a show of his confidence in the occupation forces and in his government s effectiveness   3 7  Summary of career  Heydrich s time in the SS was a mixture of rapid promotions  reserve commissions in the regular armed forces  and front line combat service  During his 11 years with the SS Heydrich  rose from the ranks  and was appointed to every rank from private to full general  He was also a major in the Luftwaffe  flying nearly 100 combat missions until 22 July 1941  when his plane was hit by Soviet anti aircraft fire  Heydrich made an emergency landing behind enemy lines  He evaded a Soviet patrol and contacted a forward German patrol  After this Hitler personally ordered Heydrich to return to Berlin to resume his SS duties  His service record also gives him credit as a Navy Reserve Lieutenant  although during World War II Heydrich had no contact with this military branch   Heydrich received a number of Nazi and military awards  including the German Order  Blood Order  Golden Party Badge  Luftwaffe Pilot s Badge  bronze and silver combat mission bars  and the Iron Cross First and Second Classes   4  Role in the Holocaust  Historians regard Heydrich as the most fearsome member of the Nazi elite  Hitler called him  the man with the iron heart   He was one of the main architects of the Holocaust during the early war years  answering only to  and taking orders from  Hitler  Göring  and Himmler in all matters pertaining to the deportation  imprisonment  and extermination of Jews   Heydrich was one of the organisers of Kristallnacht  a pogrom against Jews throughout Germany on the night of 9–10 November 1938  Heydrich sent a telegram that night to various SD and Gestapo offices  helping to co ordinate the pogrom with the SS  SD  Gestapo  uniformed police  Orpo   SA  Nazi party officials  and even the fire departments  It talks about permitting arson and destroying Jewish businesses and synagogues  and orders the confiscation of all  archival material  out of Jewish community centres and synagogues  The telegram ordered that  as many Jews – particularly affluent Jews – are to be arrested in all districts as can be accommodated in existing detention facilities     Immediately after the arrests have been carried out  the appropriate concentration camps should be contacted to place the Jews into camps as quickly as possible   Twenty thousand Jews were sent to concentration camps in the days immediately following  historians consider Kristallnacht the beginning of the Holocaust   When Hitler asked for a pretext for the invasion of Poland in 1939  Himmler  Heydrich  and Heinrich Müller masterminded a false flag plan code named Operation Himmler  It involved a fake attack on the German radio station at Gleiwitz on 31 August 1939  Heydrich masterminded the plan and toured the site  which was about four miles from the Polish border  Wearing Polish uniforms  150 German troops carried out several attacks along the border  Hitler used the ruse as an excuse to launch his invasion   On Himmler s instructions  Heydrich formed the Einsatzgruppen  task forces  to travel in the wake of the German armies at the start of World War II  On 21 September 1939  Heydrich sent out a teleprinter message on the  Jewish question in the occupied territory  to the chiefs of all Einsatzgruppen with instructions to round up Jewish people for placement into ghettos  called for the formation of Judenräte  Jewish councils   ordered a census  and promoted Aryanization plans for Jewish owned businesses and farms  among other measures  The Einsatzgruppen followed the army into Poland to implement the plans  Later  in the Soviet Union  they were charged with rounding up and killing Jews via firing squad and gas vans  By the end of the war  the Einsatzgruppen had murdered over one million people  including over 700 000 in Russia alone   On 29 November 1939  Heydrich issued a cable about the  Evacuation of New Eastern Provinces   detailing the deportation of people by railway to concentration camps  and giving guidance surrounding the December 1939 census  which would be the basis on which those deportations were performed  In May 1941 Heydrich drew up regulations with Quartermaster general Eduard Wagner for the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union  which ensured that the Einsatzgruppen and army would co operate in murdering Soviet Jews   On 10 October 1941  Heydrich was the senior officer at a meeting in Prague that discussed deporting 50 000 Jews from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to ghettos in Minsk and Riga  The officers also discussed taking 5 000 Jews from Prague  in the next few weeks  and handing them over to the Einsatzgruppen commanders Arthur Nebe and Otto Rasch  Establishing ghettos in the Protectorate was also planned  resulting in the construction of Theresienstadt  where 33 000 people would eventually die  Tens of thousands more passed through the camp on their way to their deaths in the East  In 1941 Himmler named Heydrich as  responsible for implementing  the forced movement of 60 000 Jews from Germany and Czechoslovakia to the Lodz  Litzmannstadt  Ghetto in Poland   Earlier on 31 July 1941  Hermann Göring gave written authorisation to Heydrich to ensure the cooperation of administrative leaders of various government departments in the implementation of a Endlösung der Judenfrage  Final Solution to the Jewish question  in territories under German control  On 20 January 1942  Heydrich chaired a meeting  now called the Wannsee Conference  to discuss the implementation of the plan   5  Death in Prague  In London  the Czechoslovak government in exile resolved to kill Heydrich  Jan Kubiš and Jozef Gabčík headed the team chosen for the operation  Trained by the British Special Operations Executive  SOE   the pair returned to the Protectorate  parachuting from a Handley Page Halifax  on 28 December 1941  They lived in hiding  preparing for the assassination attempt   On 27 May 1942  Heydrich planned to meet Hitler in Berlin  German documents suggest that Hitler intended to transfer Heydrich to German occupied France  where the French resistance was gaining ground  Heydrich would have to pass a section where the Dresden Prague road merged with a road to the Troja Bridge  The junction  in the Prague suburb of Libeň  was well suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend  As Heydrich s car slowed  Gabčík took aim with a Sten sub machine gun  but it jammed and failed to fire  Instead of ordering his driver to speed away  Heydrich called his car to halt and attempted to confront the attackers  Kubiš then threw a bomb  a converted anti tank mine  at the rear of the car as it stopped  The explosion wounded Heydrich and Kubiš   When the smoke cleared  Heydrich emerged from the wreckage with his gun in his hand  he chased Kubiš and tried to return fire  Kubiš jumped on his bicycle and pedalled away  Heydrich ran after him for half a block but became weak from shock and collapsed  He sent his driver  Klein  to chase Gabčík on foot  In the ensuing firefight  Gabčík shot Klein in the leg and escaped to a local safe house  Heydrich  still with pistol in hand  gripped his left flank  which was bleeding profusely   A Czech woman went to Heydrich s aid and flagged down a delivery van  Heydrich was first placed in the driver s cab  but complained that the van s movement was causing him pain  He was placed in the back of the van  on his stomach  and taken to the emergency room at Na Bulovce Hospital  Heydrich had suffered severe injuries to his left side  with major damage to his diaphragm  spleen  and lung  He had also fractured a rib  A physician  Slanina  packed the chest wound  while another doctor  Walter Diek  tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters  He immediately decided to operate  This was carried out by Diek  Slanina  and Hohlbaum  Heydrich was given several blood transfusions  A splenectomy was performed  The chest wound  left lung  and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed  Himmler ordered another physician  Karl Gebhardt  to fly to Prague to assume care  Despite a fever  Heydrich s recovery appeared to progress well  Theodor Morell  Hitler s personal physician  suggested the use of sulfonamide  a new antibacterial drug   but Gebhardt  thinking Heydrich would recover  refused  On 2 June  during a visit by Himmler  Heydrich reconciled himself to his fate by reciting a part of one of his father s operas   Heydrich slipped into a coma after Himmler s visit and never regained consciousness  He died on 4 June  probably around 04 30  He was 38  The autopsy concluded that he died of sepsis  Heydrich s facial expression as he died betrayed an  uncanny spirituality and entirely perverted beauty  like a renaissance Cardinal   according to Bernhard Wehner  a Kripo police official who investigated the assassination   After an elaborate funeral held in Prague on 7 June 1942  Heydrich s coffin was placed on a train to Berlin  where a second ceremony was held in the new Reich Chancellery on 9 June  Himmler gave the eulogy  Hitler attended and placed Heydrich s decorations—including the highest grade of the German Order  the Blood Order Medal  the Wound Badge in Gold and the War Merit Cross 1st Class with Swords—on his funeral pillow  Although Heydrich s death was employed for pro Reich propaganda  Hitler privately blamed Heydrich for his own death  through carelessness   Heydrich was interred in Berlin s Invalidenfriedhof  a military cemetery  The exact burial spot is not known—a temporary wooden marker that disappeared when the Red Army overran the city in 1945 was never replaced  so that Heydrich s grave could not become a rallying point for Neo Nazis  A photograph of Heydrich s burial shows the wreaths and mourners to be in section A  which abuts the north wall of the Invalidenfriedhof and Scharnhorststraße  at the front of the cemetery  A recent biography of Heydrich also places the grave in Section A  Hitler wanted Heydrich to have a monumental tomb but  due to Germany s declining fortunes  it was never built   After the war  the West German judicial system awarded Heydrich s widow Lina a federal pension  The couple had four children  Klaus  born in 1933  killed in a traffic accident in 1943  Heider  born in 1934  Silke  born in 1939  and Marte  born shortly after her father s death in 1942  Lina wrote a memoir  Leben mit einem Kriegsverbrecher  Living With a War Criminal   which was published in 1976  She remarried once and died in 1985   5 1  Aftermath  Heydrich s assailants hid in safe houses and eventually took refuge in Ss  Cyril and Methodius Cathedral  an Orthodox church in Prague  After a traitor in the Czech resistance betrayed their location  the church was surrounded by 800 members of the SS and Gestapo  Several Czechs were killed  and the remainder hid in the church s crypt  The Germans attempted to flush the men out with gunfire  tear gas  and by flooding the crypt  Eventually an entrance was made using explosives  Rather than surrender  the soldiers killed themselves  Supporters of the assassins who were killed in the wake of these events included the church s leader  Bishop Gorazd  who is now revered as a martyr of the Orthodox Church   Infuriated by Heydrich s death  Hitler ordered the arrest and execution of 10 000 randomly selected Czechs  But after consultations with Karl Hermann Frank  he tempered his response  The Czech lands were an important industrial zone for the German military  and indiscriminate killing could reduce the region s productivity  Hitler ordered a quick investigation  Intelligence falsely linked the assassins to the towns of Lidice and Ležáky  A Gestapo report stated that Lidice  north west of Prague  was suspected as the assailants  hiding place because several Czech army officers  then in England  had come from there and the Gestapo found a resistance radio transmitter in Ležáky  On 9 June  after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank  Hitler ordered brutal reprisals  Over 13 000 people were arrested  deported  and imprisoned  Beginning on 10 June  all males over the age of 16 in the villages of Lidice and Ležáky were murdered  All the women in Ležáky were also murdered  All but four of the women from Lidice were deported immediately to Ravensbrück concentration camp  four were pregnant – they were forcibly aborted at the same hospital where Heydrich had died and then sent to the concentration camp   A number of children were chosen for Germanization  but 81 were killed in gas vans at the Chełmno extermination camp  Both towns were burned and Lidice s ruins were levelled  At least 1 300 people were massacred after Heydrich s death   Heydrich s replacements were Ernst Kaltenbrunner as the chief of RSHA  and Karl Hermann Frank  27–28 May 1942  and Kurt Daluege  28 May 1942 – 14 October 1943  as the new acting Reichsprotektors   After Heydrich s death  the policies formalised at the Wannsee conference he chaired were carried out  The first three true death camps  designed for mass killing with no legal process or pretext  were built and operated at Treblinka  Sobibór  and Bełżec  The project was named Operation Reinhard after Heydrich   6  See also  Glossary of Nazi Germany  List of Nazi Party leaders and officials  List of rulers of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia  List of SS personnel  7
