Jamaica  the third largest Caribbean island  was inhabited by Arawak natives when it was first sighted by the second voyage of Christopher Columbus on 5 May 1494  Columbus himself was stranded on Jamaica from 1503 to 1504 during his fourth voyage  The Spanish settled in Jamaica in 1509 and held the island against many privateer raids from their main city  now called Spanish Town  which served as capital of Jamaica from its founding in 1534 until 1872  In 1655 Jamaica was conquered by the English  although the Spanish did not relinquish their claim to the island until 1670   Jamaica became a base of operations for privateers  including Captain Henry Morgan  operating from the main English settlement Port Royal  In return these privateers kept the other colonial powers from attacking the island  Following the destruction of Port Royal in the great earthquake of 1692  refugees settled across the bay in Kingston  By 1716 it had become the biggest town in Jamaica and was designated the capital city in 1872  Until slavery was abolished by Parliament in 1833  the island sugar plantations were highly dependent on slave labour  based on Africans who initially were captured  kidnapped  and sold into slavery from peoples of West and Central Africa  By the eighteenth century  sugarcane became the most important export of the island   Many slaves arrived in Jamaica via the Atlantic slave trade during the early seventeenth century  the same period when the first enslaved Africans arrived in North America  By the early nineteenth century  people of African descent greatly outnumbered ethnic Europeans  Due to the harshness of the conditions  there were many racial tensions  Jamaica had one of the highest number of slave uprisings of any Caribbean island   After the British Crown abolished slavery in 1834  the Jamaicans began working toward independence  As the island still had a strong agricultural economy  planters imported East Asians as indentured labourers for many years  Since independence in 1962  there have been political and economic disturbances  as well as a number of strong political leaders   1  Spanish rule  1509–1655  The first Spanish settlement was founded in 1509 near St Ann s Bay and named Seville  In 1534 the settlers moved to a new  healthier site  which they named Villa de la Vega  which the English renamed Spanish Town when they conquered the island in 1655  This settlement served as the capital of both Spanish and English Jamaica from its foundation in 1534 until 1872  after which the capital was moved to Kingston   In the 1640s many people were attracted to Jamaica  which had a reputation for stunning beauty  not only in reference to the island but also to the natives  Pirates were known to desert their raiding parties and stay on the island  Spanish Jamaica was subject to many privateer attacks  before the final conquest of the island by the English in 1655  The English were subject to several unsuccessful Spanish counter attacks after they occupied the island including the largest battle to be fought on Jamaican soil at the Battle of Rio Nuevo   The 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia states   A review of the Spanish occupation is one which reflects very little credit on Spanish colonial administration in those days  Their treatment of the aboriginal inhabitants  whom they are accused of having practically exterminated  is a grave charge  and if true  cannot be condoned on the plea that such conduct was characteristic of the age  and that as bad or worse was perpetrated by other nations even in later years   This is borne out by the much more detailed history of Spanish Jamaica by Francisco Morales Padrón   2  British rule  1655–1962  2 1  17th century  Spanish resistance continued for some years after the English conquest  in some cases with the help of the Jamaican Maroons  but Spain never succeeded in retaking the island  Under early English rule  Jamaica became a haven of privateers  buccaneers  and occasionally outright pirates  Christopher Myngs  Edward Mansvelt  and most famously  Henry Morgan   The English established their main coastal town at Port Royal  By 1659  two hundred houses  shops  and warehouses surrounded the fort  The town was destroyed by an earthquake in 1692  after which Kingston became the main coastal settlement   2 2  18th century  The revenues from cultivation of the lucrative commodity crops of sugar cane and coffee by African slave labour made Jamaica one of the most valuable possessions in the world for more than 150 years  The colony s slaves  who outnumbered their white masters by a ratio of 20 1 in 1800  mounted over a dozen major slave conspiracies  the majority of which were organized by Coromantins   and uprisings during the 18th century  including Tacky s revolt in 1760  Escaped slaves known as Jamaican Maroons established independent communities in the mountainous interior  which the British were unable to suppress  despite major attempts in the 1730s and 1790s  One Maroon community was expelled from the island after the Second Maroon War in the 1790s   Those Maroons  first shipped from Jamaica to Nova Scotia  eventually became part of the core of the Creole community of Sierra Leone  The majority of its members were African Americans  Black Loyalists and their descendants who had been freed and relocated to Nova Scotia after the American Revolutionary War  Life was difficult there  and nearly 2 000 chose to resettle in Sierra Leone  a British colony in West Africa   2 3  19th century  The British also used Jamaica s free people of color  10 000 strong by 1800  to keep the enslaved population in check  During the Christmas holiday of 1831  a large scale slave revolt known as the Baptist War broke out  It was organised originally as a peaceful strike by Samuel Sharpe  The rebellion was suppressed by the militia of the Jamaican plantocracy and the British garrison ten days later in early 1832   Because of the loss of property and life in the 1831 rebellion  the British Parliament held two inquiries  Their reports on conditions contributed greatly to the abolition movement and passage of the 1833 law to abolish slavery as of August 1  1834  throughout the British Empire  The Jamaican slaves were bound  indentured  to their former owners  service  albeit with a guarantee of rights  until 1838 under what was called the Apprenticeship System  The freed population faced significant hardships   Tensions resulted in the October 1865 Morant Bay rebellion led by and Paul Bogle  It was brutally repressed by the government and private militieas  George William Gordon  a friend of Paul Bogle  was hanged because he was thought to have contributed to the riot  although he was not a part of its organization or execution  As the sugar crop declined in importance in the late 19th century  the colony diversified into cultivation of bananas   In 1866 the Jamaican legislature renounced its powers  and the country became a crown colony  In 1872 the capital was moved to Kingston  as the port city had far outstripped the inland Spanish Town in size and sophistication  Some measure of self government was restored in the 1880s  when islanders gained the right to elect nine members of a legislative council   The establishment of Crown Colony rule resulted over the next few decades in the growth of a middle class of low level public officials and police officers  drawn from the mass of the population whose social and political advancement was blocked by racial discrimination  limited education and opportunities for advancement  and other restrictions maintained by the colonial authorities   2 4  20th century  The Great Depression had a serious effect on the emergent middle class and the working class of the 1930s  In the spring of 1938  sugar and dock workers around the island rose in revolt over wages and conditions  Although the revolt was suppressed  it led to significant changes  including the emergence of an organized labour movement and a competitive party system   3  Independent Jamaica  Jamaica gained a degree of local political control in the mid 1940s  The People s National Party  PNP  was founded in 1938  Its main rival  the Jamaica Labour Party  JLP  was established five years later   The first elections under universal adult suffrage were held in 1944  Jamaica joined nine other UK territories in the Federation of the West Indies in 1958 but reconsidered  After a 1961 referendum in which voters chose independence  the nation withdrew from the federation   Jamaica gained independence on August 6  1962  remaining a member of the Commonwealth of Nations  The first prime minister was Alexander Bustamante of the Jamaica Labour Party   Power regularly shifted between the People s National Party and the Jamaican Labour Party  Michael Manley was the first PNP prime minister in 1972  He introduced socialist policies and relations with Cuba  During his second term campaign  unrest in the country erupted in repeated political violence   When the PNP lost power in 1980  Edward Seaga immediately began to reverse the policies of his predecessor  He began to privatize industry and sought closer ties with the USA  When the PNP and Manley returned to power in 1989  they carried out more moderate policies  they were returned in the elections of 1993 and 1998  After Manley resigned for health reasons in 1992  he was succeeded as leader of the PNP by Percival Patterson   Historically  Jamaican emigration has been heavy  In the late 19th century and early 20th century  many Jamaicans migrated to Central America  Cuba  and the Dominican Republic to work in the banana and canefields  Others went to the United States  particularly New York City  where they became important in the rise of the Harlem Renaissance and various political movements   In the 1950s the primary destination was to the United Kingdom  but after the UK restricted immigration in 1962  the major flow has been to the United States and Canada  Because of economic problems since the 1990s  many Jamaicans have emigrated to New York and Miami for work  About 20 000 Jamaicans immigrate to the United States each year  another 200 000 visit annually  New York  Hartford  Connecticut  Miami  and Fort Lauderdale are among the U S  cities with the largest Jamaican populations  In New York  more than half the Jamaican expatriate population resides in Brooklyn  Remittances from the expatriate communities in the United States  United Kingdom  and Canada make increasingly significant contributions to Jamaica s economy   4  Slavery  4 1  Marital separation  Slaves who married each other without slavemasters  recognition might separate  without much ceremony  or by cutting a  cotta  a circular pad of dried  plaited plantain leaves  upon which slaves customarily rested the loads which they carried upon their heads     each party a half signifying  the severance of their mutual affection    Slaves in divorce had relative equality with each other  which was derived from West African traditions  under which either spouse could initiate a divorce  when  the vast majority of European women  lacked equality in divorce   5  See also  British colonization of the Americas  History of the Americas  History of the British West
