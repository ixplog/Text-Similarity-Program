A V twin engine  also called a V2 engine  is a two cylinder internal combustion engine where the cylinders are arranged in a V configuration   1  History  Gottlieb Daimler built a V twin engine in 1889  It was used as a stationary powerplant and to power boats  It was also used in Daimler s second automobile  the 1889 Stahlradwagen   steel wheeled car    The engine was also manufactured under licence in France by Panhard et Levassor   In November 1902 the Princeps AutoCar Co  UK  advertised a V twin engined motorcycle  and in 1903 V Twins were produced by other companies  including the 90 degree XL ALL  made by Eclipse Motor & Cycle Co in the UK   Also  in 1903  Glenn Curtiss in the United States  and NSU in Germany began building V twin engines for use in their respective motorcycles  Peugeot  which had used Panhard built Daimler V twins in its first cars  made its own V twin engines in the early 20th century  A Norton motorcycle powered by a Peugeot V twin engine won the first Isle of Man Tourist Trophy twin cylinder race in 1907   2  Configurations  2 1  Crankshaft configuration  Most V twin engines have a single crankpin  which is shared by both connecting rods  The connecting rods may sit side by side with offset cylinders  or they may be  fork & blade  items with cylinders in the same plane without an offset   Some notable exceptions include the Moto Guzzi 500cc  with 120° V angle and 180° crank pin offset  that Stanley Woods rode to win the 1935 Isle of Man TT  the 1983 Honda Shadow 750  claimed as being the first V twin with an offset dual pin crankshaft  and the 1987 Suzuki VX 800  45° V angle with 45° crank pin offset in USA and 75° crank pin offset for the rest of the world   2 2  V angles  Generally  any two cylinder motorcycle engine with its two cylinders arranged more than 0° and less than 180° apart is referred to as a V twin  Although Ducati use the name  L twin  for their 90° twin engine  with its front cylinder nearly horizontal and the rear cylinder almost vertical   there is no technical distinction between V twin and L twin engines  and these are merely names used by convention   A 90° V twin will  with a correct counterweight  yield perfect primary balance  although its firing intervals are uneven  A V twin with an angle of less than 90° is more compact and has more even firing intervals  but has significantly poorer mechanical balance  Offset crankpins are sometimes used to reduce the resulting vibration   3  Orientations  The terms longitudinal engine and transverse engine are most often used to refer to the crankshaft orientation  however  some sources  most prominently Moto Guzzi  use the terminology in the opposite way   A Moto Guzzi Technical Services representative tried to explain to LA Times columnist Susan Carpenter that Moto Guzzi engines are  called  transverse  because the engine is mounted with the crankshaft oriented front to back instead of left to right   In spite of this  it could be assumed that those who call V twin motorcycle engines  transverse  when they are mounted with the crankshaft front to back and the cylinders sticking out the sides are saying that to them  the engine s axis is the line passing from one cylinder to the other  at a right angle to the crankshaft  rather than going by the crankshaft s axis  Highly technical sources  such as V  Cossleter s Motorcycle Dynamics  or Gaetaeno Cocco s Motorcycle Design and Technology are careful not simply to use the terms  longitudinal engine  or  transverse engine   but rather to specify that they mark the engine s orientation based on the crankshaft  and so they will say  transverse crankshaft engine  or  longitudinal crankshaft engine   or  conversely   transversely mounted cylinders  in referenced to the classic BMW orientation  with a longitudinal crankshaft and cylinders at a right angle to the axis of the frame   3 1  Transverse crankshaft mounting  The engine can be mounted in transverse crankshaft position as on Harley Davidsons  Ducatis and many recent Japanese motorcycles  This layout produces a twin cylinder motorcycle engine that is little or no wider than a single  A narrower engine can be mounted lower in the frame with handling benefits  A significant disadvantage of this configuration for air cooled engines is that the two cylinders receive different air flows and cooling of the rear cylinder tends to be restricted  Cooling problems are somewhat mitigated by having all  four  sides of each cylinder exposed to air flow  This differs from a parallel twin cylinder engine which has a distinct front  back  and sides  but the inside of each cylinder is not exposed to airflow as the cylinders are typically joined together with a cam chain running up through the block in between the cylinders   Some transverse V twins use a single carburettor in the middle of the V angle to feed both cylinders  While this allows an economy of parts  it creates further cooling problems for the rear cylinder by placing its hot exhaust port and pipe at the back of the cylinder  out of the way or the air stream   File Ducati Monster 620 Dark jpg This air cooled Ducati Monster 620 has a transverse crankshaft 90° V twin with one cylinder lying horizontally  and one vertically  so that the rearward  vertical cylinder s air flow is less obstructed by the one in front  File Honda VTR250 2009 Engine Radiator JPG Honda s VTR250 is similar  but the engine is not leaning forward  thus each cylinder is about 45° from vertical  The rear cylinder s air flow is blocked  but note this is a water cooled engine  so what most matters is that the radiator is out in front with good air flow  File Ducati Monster S4R Testastretta jpg As the Ducati models get larger engines  they gain oil   and then water cooling  as in this Monster S4R S  Like the VTR250  the radiators are out in front  but the basic engine orientation retains the cooling advantages of the Monster 620   3 2  Longitudinal crankshaft mounting  The longitudinal crankshaft two cylinder V as seen on Moto Guzzis and some Hondas is less common  This orientation is suited to shaft drive  eliminating the need for a 90° bevel gear at the transmission end of the shaft  A longitudinal crankshaft engine fits neatly into a typical motorcycle frame  leaving ample room for the transmission  and cooling is facilitated by cylinder heads and exhausts protruding into the air stream  Longitudinal crankshaft mounting is associated with a torque reaction that tends to twist the motorcycle to one side on sharp acceleration or when opening the throttle in neutral and in the opposite direction on sharp deceleration  Many modern motorcycle manufacturers correct for this effect by rotating flywheels or alternators in the opposite direction to that of the crankshaft   4  Automobile use  BSA made a V twin car starting in 1921  then introduced a three wheeler in 1929   V twin engines  adapted from motorcycles  were featured in Morgan three wheelers made from 1911 to 1939  A number of Morgan inspired models are produced today including the Triking Cyclecar  which uses a Moto Guzzi V twin  the Ace Cycle Car  which uses a V twin Harley Davidson engine  and the JZR which uses engines from the Honda CX series   Mazda made 356 cc and 571 cc V twins beginning in 1960 for the Mazda R360  File 1934 Morgan Super Sports jpg JAP water cooled V twin engine installed in front of the radiator of a 1934 Morgan Super Sports three wheeled cyclecar  File Mazda R360 Coupe V twin engine 003 JPG Air cooled Mazda V twin engine installed in the back of a Mazda R360 kei car   5  Commercial use  Commercial equipment such as pressure washers  lawn and garden tractors  tillers  generators and water pumps use V twin engines when that equipment is large enough to need more power  usually in excess of 16 horsepower  than can be provided by a single cylinder engine  These V twin engines have horizontal or vertical crankshafts  usually have 90 degree crankshaft angles  and are usually forced air–cooled  The V twin configuration gives these engines a smaller footprint and less vibration  in the absence of balancing shafts  than other two cylinder configurations   Manufacturers of such engines include Honda with its V twin series engines  Kawasaki with its FD  FH  FS  and FX series  Subaru with its EH series  Briggs & Stratton with its Professional and Intek V twin Series  Tecumseh with its OV691EA and TVT691 engines  and Kohler   6  See also  Flat twin  Motorcycle engine  7
