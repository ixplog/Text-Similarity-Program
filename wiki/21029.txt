Molokans   for  milk drinkers   are members of a Christian sect that evolved from  Spiritual Christian  Russian peasants who refused to obey the Russian Orthodox Church  Molokan practice was first sanctioned by the Nestorian Church in the 11th century in order to accommodate the conversion of some 200 000 Kerait Tatars  who lived on meat and milk  to Nestorian Christianity  There were approximately 200 fasting days—especially the Great Fast  Lent —when drinking milk was prohibited by the ecclesiastical authorities of the time  In contrast  they called themselves  true Spiritual Christians   rather than  milk drinkers   because they could not accept the Russian Orthodox Church  nor the Protestant sects or the Catholic Church  They may have been influenced by an earlier religious sect of Armenian  Paulicians   who became known as the  Bogomils  of Thrace  Macedonia  Bulgaria  Bosnia and Serbia   In a sense Molokans are similar to Western European Protestants for rejecting Orthodoxy  and like Presbyterians in that they have a council of dominant elders  Though Molokans are somewhat similar to the European Quakers and Mennonites—for their pacifism  communal organization  spiritual meetings  and sub groupings—they are ethnically much closer to Doukhobors and Sabbatarians  Subbotnik Jews  because they evolved from the same Russian Spiritual Christian movement of Khristovers and Ikonobors  icon wrestlers   and migrated together with some intermarriage   1  History  During the reign of Ivan the Terrible  1547–1584   Matvei Simyonich Dalmatov  the first martyr of the Russian Molokan faith  split with the Nestorian Church and began to evangelize his family  his master  and local village members in and around the city of Tambov  Dalmatov carried this sectarian belief into Moscow  where a group of Mordvins heard his message and embraced it  Dalmatov was later martyred by Orthodox priests in a monastery prison by wheeling  Molokans were ostracized from Russian society in the 17th century for their refusal to bear arms and for their refusal to assist in any form of military service   The term  Molokan  was used for the first time in the 1670s  in reference to the people who ignored the 200 fasting days  drinking milk  moloko means  milk  in Russian   Molokans themselves did not completely reject the name舒even adding words like  drinking of the spiritual milk of God   according to I Peter 2 2   Like newborn babies  crave pure spiritual milk  so that by it you may grow up in your salvation     Heretics were punished in Tsarist Russia  Beatings  torture  kidnapping  imprisonment  banishment  dismembering  killing  and other forms of punishment were inflicted upon Christians who rejected the Orthodox faiths  In the 19th century  the government s policy was to send the heretics away from the center of the country into Caucasus  especially Armenia  Azerbaijan  Ukraine  central Asia  and Siberia   At the end of the 19th century  there were about 500 000 Molokans within the Russia empire  Before World War I there was a well known colony of Molokans that had been exiled to the Caucasus  an area long within Russian hegemony   mainly to what is now Georgia  Armenia  Azerbaijan  and eastern Turkey  Kars plain    After one third During the early 20th century under his fellowship  about 2 000 Molokans  mostly of the Jumpers and Leapers Sect  left for the United States and settled in the Los Angeles area near the area of Boyle Heights  and some other parts of the West Coast and Canada  It is there that they influenced in practice and doctrine a later American Revival called  the Pentecostal Azusa Street Revival  near the beginning of the 20th century  The founder of The Full Gospel Business Men s Association associates this Pentecostal Revival to the child prophet of the Molokan Jumpers  When they arrived in Los Angeles  they were befriended by local settlement house director Dana W  Bartlett  The Klubnikins continued to be involved in cattle and groceries  as they probably had done in the area of Tambov prior to exile  Others received a land grant from the Mexican government and settled in the Guadalupe Valley in Baja California  Mexico  An even smaller number of Constant Molokans fled Russia and settled mainly in the San Francisco  California and Sacramento  California areas   Presently there are about 20 000 people who  ethnically identify themselves as Molokans   There are also approximately 200 Molokan churches  150 of them in Russia and Azerbaijan  Approximately 25 000 Molokans reside in the United States  of which only about 5 000  ethnically identify themselves as Molokans   most of whom reside in California  Arizona  Oregon  Washington  Montana and Wyoming  Settlement of Molokans in southern Alaska during the 1960s was well documented  Molokans are said to be numerous in Canada  over 1 000 reside in the province of British Columbia and hundreds more in Alberta with their traditional communal lifestyle remaining intact   Significant numbers of Molokans live throughout Russia  most in the North Caucasus   Southern Ukraine  Armenia  Azerbaijan  Central Asia  and in Northern California  U S A  The oldest active congregation meets in a prayer hall built in 1929 on Potrero Hill  San Francisco  California  In 1995  the Smithsonian Folklife Festival featured Molokans as one of their peoples   Some Molokans adhere to the Old Testament kosher dietary laws and do not eat pork  shellfish  or other  unclean  foods  Some refuse to serve on juries or file lawsuits against fellow church members  Church services are conducted predominantly in the Russian language  men and women sit apart  and services are usually quite active 舑 comparable to Pentecostal activities  Molokan families encourage endogamy   2  Naming in the United States  Molokans are known for having different spellings of last names within the same immediate family   Molokans are also known for having  first names  that aren t their legal names  Many common  first names  are actually based on nicknames from childhood within the church that stuck  These are not legal names  and as such become names that make tracing family history very difficult  For example  Hazel Valov  became known as  Percy Valov   for being very  persistent    This naming process can help with family trees  but because so many relatives have similar names  and many nicknames aren t legal names  it can be complex   3  See also  Doukhobor  Christian anarchism  Peace church  List of
