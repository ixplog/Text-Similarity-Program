A non disclosure agreement  NDA   also known as a confidentiality agreement  CA   confidential disclosure agreement  CDA   proprietary information agreement  PIA   or secrecy agreement  SA   is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material  knowledge  or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes  but wish to restrict access to or by third parties  It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement  An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets  As such  an NDA protects nonpublic business information   NDAs are commonly signed when two companies  individuals  or other entities  such as partnerships  societies  etc   are considering doing business and need to understand the processes used in each other s business for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship  NDAs can be  mutual   meaning both parties are restricted in their use of the materials provided  or they can restrict the use of material by a single party   It is also possible for an employee to sign an NDA or NDA like agreement with an employer  In fact  some employment agreements will include a clause restricting employees  use and dissemination of company owned confidential information   1  Types  A non disclosure agreement may be unilateral or bilateral  that is  it may bind only one party or multiple parties  typically two    1 1  Unilateral NDA  A unilateral  or a one way  agreement is where one party wants to disclose certain information to another party but needs the information to remain secret for some reason  perhaps due to secrecy requirements required to satisfy patent laws or to make sure that the other party does not take and use the disclosed information without compensating the discloser   1 2  Bilateral NDA  A bilateral  or mutual  agreement is where both parties will be supplying information that is intended to remain secret  This type of agreement is common when businesses are considering some kind of joint venture or merger   Some practitioners insist on a mutual NDA in all cases  to encourage the drafter to make the provisions  fair and balanced  in case the drafter s receiving party client later ends up as a disclosing party  or vice versa  not an uncommon occurrence    2  Content  A nondisclosure agreement can protect any type of information that is not generally known  However  nondisclosure agreements may also contain clauses that will protect the person receiving the information so that if they lawfully obtained the information through other sources they would not be obligated to keep the information secret  In other words  the nondisclosure agreement typically only requires the receiving party to maintain information in confidence when that information has been directly supplied by the disclosing party  Ironically  however  it is sometimes easier to get a receiving party to sign a simple agreement that is shorter  less complex and does not contain safety provisions protecting the receiver   Some common issues addressed in an NDA include   outlining the parties to the agreement   the definition of what is confidential  i e  the information to be held confidential  Modern NDAs will typically include a laundry list of types of items which are covered  including unpublished patent applications  know how  schema  financial information  verbal representations  customer lists  vendor lists  business practices strategies  etc    the disclosure period – information not disclosed during the disclosure period  e g   one year after the date of the NDA  is not deemed confidential   the exclusions from what must be kept confidential  Typically  the restrictions on the disclosure or use of the confidential data will be invalid if  the recipient had prior knowledge of the materials   the recipient gained subsequent knowledge of the materials from another source   the materials are generally available to the public  or  the materials are subject to a subpoena – although many practitioners regard that fact as a category of permissible disclosure  not as a categorical exclusion from confidentiality  because court ordered secrecy provisions may apply even in case of a subpoena   In any case  a subpoena would more likely than not override a contract of any sort   provisions restricting the transfer of data in violation of national security   the term  in years  of the confidentiality  i e  the time period of confidentiality   the term  in years  the agreement is binding   permission to obtain ex parte injunctive relief   the obligations of the recipient regarding the confidential information  typically including some version of obligations   to use the information only for enumerated purposes   to disclose it only to persons with a need to know the information for those purposes   to use appropriate efforts  not less than reasonable efforts  to keep the information secure  Reasonable efforts is often defined as a standard of care relating to confidential information that is no less rigorous than that which the recipient uses to keep its own similar information secure  and  to ensure that anyone to whom the information is disclosed further abides by obligations restricting use  restricting disclosure  and ensuring security at least as protective as the agreement  and  types of permissible disclosure – such as those required by law or court order  many NDAs require the receiving party to give the disclosing party prompt notice of any efforts to obtain such disclosure  and possibly to cooperate with any attempt by the disclosing party to seek judicial protection for the relevant confidential information    the law and jurisdiction governing the parties  The parties may choose exclusive jurisdiction of a court of a country   2 1  California  In California  and some other states  there are some special circumstances relating to non disclosure agreements and non compete clauses  California s courts and legislature have signaled that they generally value an employee s mobility and entrepreneurship more highly than they do protectionist doctrine   2 2  India  Use of non disclosure agreements are on the rise in India and is governed by the Indian Contract Act 1872  Use of an NDA is crucial in many circumstances  such as to tie in employees who are developing patentable technology if the employer intends to apply for a patent  Non disclosure agreements have become very important in light of India s burgeoning outsourcing industry  In India  an NDA must be stamped to be a valid enforceable
