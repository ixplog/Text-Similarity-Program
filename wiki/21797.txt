Nahum   or     was a minor prophet whose prophecy is recorded in the Hebrew Bible  His book comes in chronological order between Micah and Habakkuk in the Bible  He wrote about the end of the Assyrian Empire  and its capital city  Nineveh  in a vivid poetic style   1  Life  Little is known about Nahum’s personal history  His name means  comforter   and he was from the town of Alqosh   Nah 1 1  which scholars have attempted to identify with several cities  including the modern `Alqush of Assyria and Capharnaum of northern Galilee  He was a very nationalistic Hebrew however and lived amongst the Elkoshites in peace  Nahum  called  the Elkoshite   is the seventh in order of the minor prophets   2  Works  Nahum s writings could be taken as prophecy or as history  One account suggests that his writings are a prophecy written in about 615 BC  just before the downfall of Assyria  while another account suggests that he wrote this passage as liturgy just after its downfall in 612 BC   The book was introduced in Calvin s Commentary as a complete and finished poem   Nahum  taking words from Moses himself  has shown in a general way what sort of  Being God is   The Reformation theologian Calvin argued  Nahum painted God by which his nature must be seen  and  it is from that most memorable vision  when God appeared to Moses after the breaking of the tables    3  Tomb  The tomb of Nahum is supposedly inside the synagogue at Alqosh  although there are other places outside Iraq that lay claim also to being the original “Elkosh” from which Nahum hailed  Alquosh was abandoned by its Jewish population in 1948  when they were expelled  and the synagogue that purportedly houses the tomb is in a poor structural state  to the extent that the tomb itself is in danger of destruction  The tomb underwent basic repairs in 1796  When all Jews were compelled to flee Alqosh in 1948  the iron keys to the tomb were handed to a Assyrian man by the name of Sami Jajouhana  Few Jews visit the historic site  yet Jajouhana continues to keep the promise he made with his Jewish friends  and looks after the tomb  A team of US UK construction engineers  led by Huw Thomas  is currently planning ways to save the building and the tomb  Money had been allocated for proposed renovation in 2008   4  Liturgical commemoration  The Prophet Nahum is venerated as a saint in Eastern Christianity  On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar  his feast day is December 1 for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar  December 1 currently falls on December 14 of the modern Gregorian Calendar   He is commemorated with the other minor prophets in the Calendar of saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 31   5  References  6  External links  article from The Catholic Encyclopedia  Orthodox icon and synaxarion
