Robert Zubrin  born April 9  1952  is an American aerospace engineer and author  best known for his advocacy of the manned exploration of Mars  He was the driving force behind Mars Direct—a proposal intended to produce significant reductions in the cost and complexity of such a mission  The key idea was to use the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen  water  and rocket propellant for the surface stay and return journey  A modified version of the plan was subsequently adopted by NASA as their  design reference mission   He questions the delay and cost to benefit ratio of first establishing a base or outpost on an asteroid or another Project Apollo like return to the Moon  as neither would be able to provide all of its own oxygen  water  or energy  these resources are producible on Mars  and he expects people would be there thereafter   Disappointed with the lack of interest from government in Mars exploration and after the success of his book The Case for Mars as well as leadership experience at the National Space Society  Zubrin established the Mars Society in 1998  This is an international organization advocating a manned Mars mission as a goal  by private funding if possible   Zubrin lives in Lakewood  Colorado  he has two daughters  Rachel and Sarah   1  Qualifications and professional experience  Zubrin holds a B A  in Mathematics from the University of Rochester  1974   a M S  in Nuclear Engineering  1984   a M S  in Aeronautics and Astronautics  1986   and a Ph D  in Nuclear Engineering  1992  — all from the University of Washington  He has developed a number of concepts for space propulsion and exploration  and is the author of over 200 technical and non technical papers and five books  He was a member of Lockheed Martin s scenario development team charged with developing strategies for space exploration  He was also  a senior engineer with the Martin Marietta Astronautics company  working as one of its leaders in development of advanced concepts for interplanetary missions   The Case for Mars 1996   He is also President of both the Mars Society and Pioneer Astronautics  a private company that does research and development on innovative aerospace technologies  Zubrin is the co inventor on a U S  design patent and a U S  utility patent on a hybrid rocket airplane  and on a U S  utility patent on an oxygen supply system  see links below   He was awarded his first patent at age 20 in 1972 for Three Player Chess  His inventions also include the nuclear salt water rocket and co inventor  with Dana Andrews  of the magnetic sail   2  Pioneer Energy  In 2008  Zubrin founded   a research and development firm headquartered in Lakewood  Colorado  The company s focus is to develop mobile Enhanced Oil Recovery  EOR  systems that can enable CO2 based EOR for both small and large oil producers in the United States  The company has also developed a number of new processes for manufacturing synthetic fuels   3  Books  The Case for Mars  The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must  1996   with Richard Wagner  This outlines the Mars Direct plan along with speculation about the economic  social and technical viability of future Mars colonization  Revised and updated in 2011   Entering Space  Creating a Spacefaring Civilization  1999   This ranges from the current status quo and innovative startups of the aerospace industry  through exploration and colonization of Mars  to a more futuristic look at humanity s possible colonization of the solar system and the feasibility of interstellar travel with known physics   Mars On Earth  The Adventures of Space Pioneers in the High Arctic  2003   Zubrin recounts the origins and progress of the Mars Society s Mars Analog Research Station project  including a variety of perils  both mundane and adventurous  that were overcome in establishing the first analog Mars habitat on Devon Island in the high Arctic  He offers highlights of what has been learned so far through that effort   First Landing  2001   a hard science fiction novel about a future Mars flight using the Mars Direct plan   The Holy Land  2003   This is an  SF satire on the Middle East crisis and the War on Terrorism  and concerns what happens when the liberal Western Galactic Empire relocates the oppressed Minervan sect to their ancient homeland of Kennewick  Washington  in the midst of a United States ruled by Christian fundamentalist fanatics   The story was partly inspired by Čapek s War with the Newts   Benedict Arnold  A Drama of the American Revolution in Five Acts  2005   This is an effort to humanize and show the multiple dimensions of Benedict Arnold  and to contrast the democratic values embodied in the spirit of the Revolution with the socially bankrupt classism embodied in the British subjects who won Arnold to their side   Energy Victory  Winning the War on Terror by Breaking Free of Oil  2007   An expansion on his recent articles criticizing both reliance on oil and the potential for hydrogen energy  while highlighting the benefits of switching more toward methanol and ethanol  It carries an endorsement from former CIA director James Woolsey   How to Live on Mars  2008   A tongue in cheek technically accurate guidebook for Mars bound Earthlings about how to survive and thrive on the Red Planet  written from the point of view of a 22nd century Mars native   Merchants of Despair  Radical Environmentalists  Criminal Pseudo Scientists  and the Fatal Cult of Antihumanism  2011   This traces the history of antihumanism over the last two centuries  from Thomas Malthus and the eugenics movement through to the anti nuclear and global warming campaigns  Zubrin argues that these movements have all represented an attempt to gain oppressive political control through the restriction of human activities and freedom   Mars Direct  Space Exploration  the Red Planet  and the Human Future  2013   This e book looks at the current situation of NASA and outlines a Mars Direct mission proposal with the SpaceX Dragon  and considers the implications of interplanetary exploration for humanity   4  Books edited or co authored  Zubrin has also edited or co edited the following

terraforming often make reference to a series of public debates Zubrin has held with his friend Christopher McKay  who advocates a moderately biocentric position on the ethics of terraforming  For example  a written account of some of these debates is available in On to Mars  Colonizing a New World  as a joint article   Do Indigenous Martian Bacteria have Precedence over Human Exploration    pp  177–182   6  Cultural references  An aging Robert Zubrin also appears as a background character in The Martian Race  1999  by Gregory Benford  a science fiction novel depicting early human explorers on Mars in the very near future  Benford  who is also an astrophysicist  is a longtime member of both the board of directors and the steering committee of the Mars Society   Robert Zubrin was also
