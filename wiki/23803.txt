Pope Leo III  750 â€“ 12 June 816  was Pope from 795 to his death in 816  Protected by Charlemagne from his enemies in Rome  he subsequently strengthened Charlemagne s position by crowning him Roman Emperor and Augustus of the Romans   1  Life  Leo was a Roman  the son of Atyuppius and Elizabeth  At the time of his election he was Cardinal Priest of St  Susanna  and seemingly also vestiarius  or chief of the pontifical treasury  or wardrobe  He was elected on the very day his predecessor  Adrian I  was buried  26 Dec   795   and consecrated on the following day  It is quite possible that this haste may have been due to a desire on the part of the Romans to anticipate any interference of the Franks with their freedom of election  With the letter informing Charlemagne that he had been unanimously elected pope  Leo sent him the keys of the confession of St  Peter  and the standard of the city  and requested an envoy  This he did to show that he regarded the Frankish king as the protector of the Holy See   In return he received from Charlemagne letters of congratulation and a great part of the treasure which the king had captured from the Avars  The acquisition of this wealth was one of the causes which enabled Leo to be such a great benefactor to the churches and charitable institutions of Rome  While Charlemagne s letter is respectful and even affectionate  it also exhibits Charles  concept of the coordination of the spiritual and temporal powers  nor does he hesitate to remind the pope of his grave spiritual obligations  Charlemagne s reply stated that it was his function to defend the Church  and the function of the Pope to pray for the realm and for the victory of his army   Prompted by jealousy or ambition  or by feelings of hatred and revenge  a number of the relatives of Pope Adrian I formed a plot to render Leo unfit to hold his sacred office  On the occasion of the procession of the Greater Litanies  25 April  799   when the pope was making his way towards the Flaminian Gate  he was suddenly attacked by a body of armed men  He was dashed to the ground  and an effort was made to root out his tongue and tear out his eyes and left him unconscious  He was rescued by two of the king s missi  who came with a considerable force  The Duke of Spoleto sheltered the fugitive pope  who went later to Paderborn  where the king s camp then was  He was received by the Frankish king with the greatest honour at Paderborn  This meeting forms the basis of the epic poem Karolus Magnus et Leo Papa   His enemies had accused Leo of adultery and perjury  Charlemagne ordered them to Paderborn  but no decision could be made  He then had Leo escorted back to Rome  In November 800  Charlemagne himself went to Rome  and on 1 December held a council there with representatives of both sides  Leo  on 23 December  took an oath of purgation concerning the charges brought against him  and his opponents were exiled   2  Coronation of Charlemagne  Charlemagne s father  Pepin defended the papacy against the Lombards and issued the Donation of Pepin  which granted the land around Rome to the pope as a fief  In 774 Pope Adrian I had conferred on Charles his father dignity of Patricius Romanus  which implied primarily the protection of the Roman Church in all its rights and privileges  above all in the temporal authority which it had gradually acquired  notably in the former Byzantine Duchy of Rome and the Exarchate of Ravenna  by just titles in the course of the two preceding centuries  Two days after Leo s oath  on Christmas Day 800  he crowned Charlemagne as Roman emperor of the Holy Roman Empire  According to Charlemagne s biographer  Einhard  Vita Caroli 28  Charles had no suspicion of what was about to happen  and if informed would not have accepted the imperial crown  On the other hand  there seems no reason to doubt that for some time previous the elevation of Charles had been discussed  both at home and at Rome  especially in view of two facts  the scandalous condition of the imperial government at Constantinople  and the acknowledged grandeur and solidity of the Carolingian house  The coronation offended Constantinople  which had seen itself still as the rightful defender of Rome  but the Eastern Roman Empress Irene of Athens  like many of her predecessors since Justinian  was too weak to offer protection to the city or its much reduced citizenry   In 808  Leo committed Corsica to Charlemagne for safe keeping because of Muslim attacks  originating from Al Andalus  on the island  Nonetheless  Corsica  along with Sardinia  would still go on to be occupied by Muslim forces in 809 and 810   2 1  Significance  Few moments in world history proved to be of greater significance than what transpired in St  Peter s Basilica in Rome on Christmas Day in the year 800  Charlemagne became the father of Europe  At his royal court  he gathered the cream of available intellect  centered around the scholar Alcuin  whom he brought from York in England  Monks and other copyists were set to transcribing ancient manuscripts  both classical and Christian  for the preservation and extension of learning  Schools were established at monasteries and cathedrals  the forerunners of the great universities  Myriad hymns and poems were composed  along with commentaries on Holy Scripture  treatises on music  theological works  and numerous chronicles of history  Advances were made in architecture  at Aachen and Ingelheim  for instance   technology  such as the iron horseshoe and the padded harness for plowing with horses   and agriculture  for example  the system of triple crop rotation    Under the leadership of this wise and powerful monarch there arose a cultural enrichment still known as the Carolingian Renaissance  Although the political unity Charlemagne imposed on the greater part of that continent did not outlive him  the cultural unity of Europe did   Leo helped restore King Eardwulf of Northumbria and settled various matters of dispute between the Archbishops of York and Canterbury  He also reversed the decision of his predecessor Pope Adrian I  in regards to the granting of the pallium to Higbert  Bishop of Lichfield  He believed that the English episcopate had been misrepresented before Adrian and that therefore his act was invalid  In 803  Lichfield was a regular diocese again   Leo forbade the addition of Filioque to the Nicene Creed  when asked to confirm the decision of a Council of Aachen held in 809  Although he approved of the doctrine thus expressed  he also ordered that the Nicene Creed  without Filioque  be displayed on silver tablets placed in Saint Peter s Basilica  adding   Haec Leo posui amore et cautela orthodoxae fidei   I  Leo  put these here for love and protection of orthodox faith    The reasons for the coronation of Charlemagne  the involvement beforehand of the Frankish court  and the relationship to the Eastern Roman Empire are all matters of debate among historians  An effective administrator of the papal territories  Leo contributed to the beautification of Rome   Leo III wasn t officially canonized  but his name was included in the Roman Martyrology in 1673 under Pope Clement X  Because of this irregurality and the lack of evidences about his holiness  his name was eliminated during liturgical reform in 1953 by Pope Pius XII   3  Burial  Leo III was originally buried in his own monument  However  some years after his death  his remains were put into a tomb that contained the first four Pope Leos  In the 18th century  the relics of Leo I were separated from the other Leos  and he was given his own chapel   4  See also  Rags to riches  5  References  6  External links
