The Double Cross System  or XX System  was a World War II anti espionage and deception operation of the British military intelligence arm  MI5  Nazi agents in Britain – real and false – were captured  turned themselves in or simply announced themselves and were then used by the British to broadcast mainly disinformation to their Nazi controllers  Its operations were overseen by the Twenty Committee under the chairmanship of John Cecil Masterman  the name of the committee comes from the number 20 in Roman numerals   XX   i e  double crosses    The policy of MI5 during the war was initially to use the system for counter espionage  It was only later that its potential for deception purposes was realised  Agents from both of the German intelligence services  the Abwehr and Sicherheitsdienst  SD   were apprehended  Many of the agents who reached British shores turned themselves in to the authorities  Still others were apprehended when they made elementary mistakes during their operations  In addition  some were false agents who had tricked the Germans into believing they would spy for them if they helped them reach England  e g  Treasure  Fido   Later agents were instructed to contact agents in place who  unknown to the Abwehr  were already controlled by the British  The Abwehr and SD sent agents over by a number of means including parachute drops  submarine and travel via neutral countries  The last route was most commonly used  with agents often impersonating refugees  After the war it was discovered that all the agents Germany sent to Britain had given themselves up or had been captured with the possible exception of one who committed suicide   1  Early agents  Following a July 1940 conference in Kiel  the Abwehr  German intelligence  launched an espionage campaign against Britain involving both intelligence gathering and sabotage  The spies were sent over from Europe in various ways  some parachuted or came off a submarine  Others entered the country on false passports  or posing as refugees   Public perception in Britain at that time was that the country was full of well trained German spies who were deeply integrated into society  There was widespread  as Churchill put it   spy mania   The truth was that between September and November 1940 fewer than twenty five agents arrived in the country  mostly of Eastern European extraction  badly trained and poorly motivated   The agents were not difficult to spot   a task made still easier by the cracking of the German s Enigma encryption  MI5  with advance warning of infiltration  had no trouble picking up almost all of the spies sent to the country  Writing in 1972  John C  Masterman  who would later head the Twenty Committee  said that by 1941 MI5  actively ran and controlled the German espionage system in  the United Kingdom    It was not an idle boast  post war records confirmed that none of the Abwehr agents  bar one who committed suicide  went unnoticed   Once caught  the spies were deposited in the care of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Stephens at Camp 020  Latchmere House  Richmond   After Stephens  a notorious and brilliant interrogator  had picked apart their life history  the agents were either spirited away  to be imprisoned or executed  or  if judged acceptable  offered the chance to turn double on the Germans   Control of these new double agents fell to Thomas Argyll Robertson  usually called Tar  from his initials   a charismatic MI5 agent  A Scot  and something of a playboy  Robertson had some early experience with double agents  just prior to the war he had been case officer to Arthur Owens  code name Snow   Owens was an oddity  and it became apparent that he was simply playing the Germans and British against each other 舑 to what end Robertson was unable to uncover  The experiment had not appeared to be a success  but MI5 had learned key lessons about how the Abwehr operated and how double agents might be useful   Robertson  in particular  believed that turning German spies against their masters would have numerous benefits  for example determining what information the Abwehr wanted or to actively mislead them as part of a military deception  In addition  it would discourage them from sending more agents if they believed an operational network existed  Section B1A  a subordinate of B section  under Guy Liddell  was formed and Robertson was put in charge of handling the double agent program   Robertson s first agents were not a success  Giraffe  George Graf  was never really used and Gander  Kurt Goose  MI5 had a thing for amusingly relevant code names  had been sent to Britain with a radio that could only transmit  not receive  Both were quickly decommissioned  The next two attempts involved even more farce  Gösta Caroli and Wulf Schmidt  a Danish citizen  landed  via parachute  in September 1940  The two were genuine Nazis  had trained together and were friends  Caroli was coerced into turning double in return for Schmidt s life being spared  whilst Schmidt was told that Caroli had sold him out and in anger swapped sides   Caroli quickly became a problem  he attempted to strangle his MI5 handler before making an escape carrying a canoe  on a motorcycle  He vaguely planned to row to Holland  but came unstuck after falling off the bike in front of a policeman  He was eventually recaptured and judged too much trouble to be used  Schmidt was more of a success  Codenamed  Tate   he continued to contact Germany until May 1945  However  these eccentric spies made Robertson aware that handling double agents was going to be a difficult task   2  Methods of operation  The main form of communication that agents used with their handlers was secret writing  Letters were intercepted by the postal censorship authorities and some agents were caught by this method  Later in the war  wireless sets were provided by the Germans  Eventually transmissions purporting to be from one double agent were facilitated by transferring the operation of the set to the main headquarters of MI5 itself  On the British side  a critical aid in the fight against the Abwehr and SD was the breaking of the German ciphers  Abwehr hand ciphers were cracked early in the war  and SD hand ciphers and Abwehr Enigma ciphers followed thereafter  The signals intelligence allowed an accurate assessment of whether the double agents were really trusted by the Germans and what effect their information had   A crucial aspect of the system was the need for genuine information to be sent along with the deception material  This need caused problems on a regular basis early in the war  with those who controlled the release of information reluctant to provide even a small amount of relatively innocuous genuine material  Later in the war  as the system became a more coherent whole  genuine information was integrated into the deception system  For example  one of the agents sent genuine information about Operation Torch to the Germans  It was postmarked before the landing  but due to delays deliberately introduced by the British authorities  the information did not reach the Germans until after the Allied troops were ashore  The information impressed the Germans as it appeared to date from before the attack  but it was militarily useless to them   3  Operation outside the United Kingdom  It was not only in the United Kingdom that the system was operated  A number of agents connected with the system were run in neutral Spain and Portugal  Some even had direct contact with the Germans in occupied Europe  One of the most famous of the agents who operated outside of the UK was Dušan Popov   Tricycle    There was even a case in which an agent started running deception operations independently from Portugal using little more than guidebooks  maps  and a very vivid imagination to convince his Abwehr handlers that he was spying in the UK  This agent  Joan Pujol Garcia   Garbo    created an entire network of phantom sub agents and finally succeeded in convincing the British authorities that he could be useful  He and his fictitious network were absorbed into the main Double Cross System  and he became so respected by the Abwehr that they stopped landing agents in Britain after 1942  They thus became wholly dependent on the spurious information that was fed to them by Garbo s network and the other Double Cross agents   4  Operation Fortitude and D Day landings  The British put their double agent network to work in support of Operation Fortitude  a plan to deceive the Germans about the location of the invasion of France  Allowing one of the double agents to claim to have stolen documents describing the closely guarded invasion plans might have aroused suspicion  Instead  agents were allowed to report minutiae such as insignia on soldiers  uniforms and unit markings on vehicles  The observations in the south central areas largely gave accurate information about the units located there  the actual invasion forces  Reports from southwest England indicated few troop sightings  when in reality many units were housed there  Reports from the southeast depicted the real and the notional Operation Quicksilver forces  Any military planner would know that to mount a massive invasion of Europe from England  Allied units had to be staged around the country  with those that would land first nearest to the invasion point  German intelligence used the agent reports to construct an order of battle for the Allied forces that placed the centre of gravity of the invasion force opposite Pas de Calais  the point on the French coast closest to England and therefore a likely invasion site  The deception was so effective that the Germans kept 15 reserve divisions near Calais even after the invasion had begun at Normandy  lest it prove to be a diversion from the main invasion at Calais   The Allies were willing to risk exposing the Double Cross network to achieve the needed surprise for the Normandy invasion  However  early battle reports of insignia on Allied units that the German armies encountered only confirmed the information the double agents had sent  increasing the Germans  trust in their network  Some of the double agents were informed in radio messages from Germany after the invasion that they had been awarded the Iron Cross   5  V weapons deception  The British noticed that  during the V 1 flying bomb attacks of 1944  the weapons were falling 2–3 miles short of Trafalgar Square — the actual Luftwaffe aiming points such as Tower Bridge were unknown to the British  Duncan Sandys was told to get MI5 controlled German agents such as Zig Zag and TATE to report the V 1 impacts back to Germany  In order to make the Germans aim short  the British used the double agents to exaggerate the number of V 1s falling in the north and west of London and not to report  when possible  those in the south and east  For example  circa June 22  1944  only one of seven impacts was reported as being south of the Thames  when ¾ of the impacts had been there  Although Germany was able to plot a sample of V 1s which had radio transmitters  which confirmed that they had fallen short  the telemetry was disregarded in favour of the human intelligence   When the German 65th Army Corps received a false Double Cross V 1 report that there was considerable damage in Southampton —which had not been a V 1 target—the V 1s were temporarily aimed at the South Coast Ports  V 1s were extremely powerful  As a result  the Double Cross deception also caused retargetting from London  not just inaccurate aiming  However  when V 1s launched from Heinkel He 111s at Southampton on July 7 were inaccurate  British advisor Frederick Lindemann recommended the agents report that the attack caused  heavy losses  in order to save hundreds of Londoners each week at the expense of only a few lives in the ports  When the Cabinet learned on August 15 of the deception  Herbert Morrison said that they had no right to decide that one man should die while another should survive  but the deception was approved to continue   Moreover  when the subsequent V 2 rocket blitz began with only a few minutes from launch to impact  the deception was enhanced by providing locations genuinely damaged by bombing  verifiable by aerial reconnaissance  for impacts in central London  but each time tagged with the time of an earlier impact that had fallen 5–8 miles short of central London  From mid January to mid February 1945  the mean point of V 2 impacts edged eastward at the rate of a couple of miles a week  with more and more V 2s falling short of central London   6  List of agents   Artist  – Johnny Jebsen   Balloon    Dickie Metcalf   Basket    Joseph Lenihan   Beetle
