A part of Southeast Africa  the territory of what is now Kenya has seen human habitation since the beginning of the Lower Paleolithic  The Bantu expansion from a West African center of dispersal reached the area by the 1st millennium AD  With the borders of the modern state at the crossroads of the Bantu  Nilo Saharan and Afro Asiatic ethno linguistic areas of Africa  Kenya is a truly multi ethnic state   European and Arab presence in Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period  but European exploration of the interior began only in the 19th century  The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895  from 1920 known as the Kenya Colony   The independent Republic of Kenya was formed in 1964  It was ruled as a de facto single party state by the Kenya African National Union  KANU   an alliance led by Jomo Kenyatta during 1963 to 1978  Kenyatta was succeeded by Daniel arap Moi  who ruled until 2002  Moi attempted to transform the de facto single party status of Kenya into a de jure status during the 1980s  but with the end of the Cold War  the practices of political repression and torture which had been  overlooked  by the Western powers as necessary evils in the effort to contain communism were no longer tolerated   Moi came under pressure  notably by US ambassador Smith Hempstone  to restore a multi party system  which he did by 1991  Moi won elections in 1992 and 1997  which were overshadowed by political killings on both sides  During the 1990s  evidence of Moi s involvement in human rights abuses and corruption  Goldenberg scandal  was uncovered  He was constitutionally barred from running in the 2002 election  which was won by Mwai Kibaki  Widely reported electoral fraud on Kibaki s side in the 2007 elections resulted in the 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis   1  Prehistory  In 1929  the first evidence of the presence of ancient early human ancestors in Kenya was discovered when Louis Leakey unearthed 1 million year old Acheulian hand axes at Kariandusi in south west Kenya  Subsequently many species of early hominid have been discovered in Kenya  The oldest was found by Martin Pickford in the year 2000 and is the 6 million years old Orrorin tugenensis  named after the Tugen Hills where it was unearthed    It is the second oldest fossil hominid in the world after Sahelanthropus tchadensis  In 1995 Meave Leakey named a new species of hominid Australopithecus anamensis following a series of fossil discoveries near Lake Turkana in 1965  1987 and 1994  and is around 4 1 million years old   One of the most famous and complete hominid skeletons ever discovered was the 1 6 million year old Homo erectus known as the Turkana Boy which was found by Kamoya Kimeu in 1984 on an excavation led by Richard Leakey  The oldest Acheulean tools ever discovered anywhere in the world are from West Turkana  and were dated in 2011 through the method of magnetostratigraphy to about 1 76 million years old   Remarkable prehistoric sites in the interior of Kenya include the archaeoastronomical site Namoratunga on the west side of Lake Turkana and the walled settlement of ThimLich Ohinga in Nyanza Province   2  Neolithic  The first inhabitants of present day Kenya were hunter gatherer groups  akin to the modern Khoisan speakers  Cushitic language speaking people from northern Africa moved into the area that is now Kenya beginning around 2000 BC  The Bantu expansion is estimated to have reached during the 1st millennium BC or the early centuries AD   3  Early Arab and European presence  Arab traders began frequenting the Kenya coast around the 1st century AD  Kenya s proximity to the Arabian Peninsula invited trade and later settlement  Between the first and the fifth centuries AD  Greek merchants from Egypt had some stake in the trade  About 500 AD  traders from the Persian Gulf  southern India and Indonesia made contact with East Africa  Trade led to establishment of commercial posts  Eventually  these commercial posts became Bantu African  Arab and Persian city states along the coast  By the 8th century these city states tended to have rulers that had accepted Islam   Muslim traders  had little incentive to go beyond the coast into the interior of Africa  The goods they sought—gold from the mines of Zimbabwe  ivory  slaves  tortoise shell and rhinoceros horn—could more conveniently be gathered by local people in the interior and sold to the traders at the coasts during seasonal markets   Swahili  a Bantu language with many Arabic loan words  developed as a lingua franca for trade between the different peoples  A Swahili culture developed in the towns  notably Pate  Malindi  and Mombasa  The impact of these Arabic and Persian traders and immigrants on the Swahili culture remains controversial  During the Middle Ages   the East African Swahili coast  including Zanzibar  was a wealthy and advanced region  which consisted of many autonomous merchant cities  Wealth flowed into the cities via the Africans  roles as intermediaries and facilitators of Indian  Persian  Arab  Indonesian  Malaysian  African  and Chinese merchants  All of these peoples enriched the Swahili culture to some degree  The Swahili culture developed its own written language  the language incorporated elements from different civilizations  with Arabic as its strongest quality  Some Arab settlers were rich merchants who  because of their wealth  gained power—sometimes as rulers of coastal cities  The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama reached Mombasa in 1498  The goal of Portuguese presence was not settlement but the establishment of naval bases that would give Portugal control of the Indian Ocean  After decades of small scale conflict the Portuguese were defeated in Kenya by Arabs from Oman  Under Seyyid Said  the Omani sultan who moved his capital to Zanzibar in the early 19th century  the Arabs created long distance trade routes into the interior  The dry reaches of the north were lightly inhabited by seminomadic pastoralists  In the south  pastoralists and cultivators bartered goods and competed for land as long distance caravan routes linked them to the Kenya coast on the east and the kingdoms of Uganda on the west  Arab  Shirazi  and coastal African cultures produced an Islamic Swahili people trading in a variety of up country commodities  including slaves   The Portuguese were the first Europeans to explore the region of current day Kenya  Vasco da Gama having visited Mombasa in 1498  Gama s voyage was successful in reaching India and this permitted the Portuguese to trade with the Far East directly by sea  thus challenging older trading networks of mixed land and sea routes  such as the Spice trade routes that utilised the Persian Gulf  Red Sea and caravans to reach the eastern Mediterranean  The Republic of Venice had gained control over much of the trade routes between Europe and Asia  After traditional land routes to India had been closed by the Ottoman Turks  Portugal hoped to use the sea route pioneered by Gama to break the Venetian trading monopoly  Portuguese rule in East Africa focused mainly on a coastal strip centred in Mombasa  The Portuguese presence in East Africa officially began after 1505  when flagships under the command of Dom Francisco de Almeida conquered Kilwa  an island located in what is now southern Tanzania   The Portuguese presence in East Africa served the purpose of controlling trade within the Indian Ocean and securing the sea routes linking Europe to Asia  Portuguese naval vessels were very disruptive to the commerce of Portugal s enemies within the western Indian Ocean and were able to demand high tariffs on items transported through the area  given their strategic control of ports and shipping lanes  The construction of Fort Jesus in Mombasa in 1593 was meant to solidify Portuguese hegemony in the region  but their influence was clipped by the English  Dutch and Omani Arab incursions into the region during the 17th century  The Omani Arabs posed the most direct challenge to Portuguese influence in East Africa besieging Portuguese fortresses and openly attacking naval vessels  Omani forces captured Fort Jesus in 1698 but lost it in a revolt but by 1730 they had expelled the remaining Portuguese from the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts  By this time the Portuguese Empire had already lost its interest on the spice trade sea route because of the decreasing profitability of that business  Portuguese ruled territories  ports and settlements remained active to the south  in Mozambique  until 1975   4  19th century history  Omani Arab colonisation of the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts brought the once independent city states under closer foreign scrutiny and domination than was experienced during the Portuguese period  Like their predecessors  the Omani Arabs were primarily able only to control the coastal areas  not the interior  However  the creation of clove plantations  intensification of the slave trade and relocation of the Omani capital to Zanzibar in 1839 by Seyyid Said had the effect of consolidating the Omani power in the region  Arab governance of all the major ports along the East African coast continued until British interests aimed particularly at securing their  Indian Jewel  and creation of a system of trade among individuals began to put pressure on Omani rule  By the late nineteenth century  the slave trade on the open seas had been completely strangled by the British   The Omani Arabs had no interest in resisting the Royal Navy s efforts to enforce anti slavery directives  As the Moresby Treaty demonstrated  whilst Oman sought sovereignty over its waters  Seyyid Said saw no reason to intervene in the slave trade  as the main customers for the slaves were Europeans  As Farquhar in a letter made note  only with the intervention of Said would the European Trade in slaves in the Western Indian Ocean be abolished  As The Omani presence continued in Zanzibar and Pemba until the 1964 revolution  but the official Omani Arab presence in Kenya was checked by German and British seizure of key ports and creation of crucial trade alliances with influential local leaders in the 1880s  Nevertheless  the Omani Arab legacy in East Africa is currently found through their numerous descendants found along the coast that can directly trace ancestry to Oman and are typically the wealthiest and most politically influential members of the Kenyan coastal community   The first Christian mission was founded on 25 August 1846  by Dr  Johann Ludwig Krapf  a German sponsored by the Church Missionary Society of England  He established a station among the Mijikenda on the coast  He later translated the Bible into Swahili   By 1850 European explorers had begun mapping the interior  Three developments encouraged European interest in East Africa in the first half of the nineteenth century  First  was the emergence of the island of Zanzibar  located off the east coast of Africa  Zanzibar became a base from which trade and exploration of the African mainland could be mounted  By 1840  to protect the interests of the various nationals doing business in Zanzibar  consul offices had been opened by the British  French  Germans and Americans  In 1859  the tonnage of foreign shipping calling at Zanzibar had reached 19 000 tons  By 1879  the tonnage of this shipping had reached 89 000 tons  The second development spurring European interest in Africa was the growing European demand for products of Africa including ivory and cloves  Thirdly  British interest in East Africa was first stimulated by their desire to abolish the slave trade  Later in the century  British interest in East Africa would be stimulated by German competition  and in 1887 the Imperial British East Africa Company  a private concern  leased from Seyyid Said his mainland holdings  a 10 mile  16 km  wide strip of land along the coast   5  British rule  1895–1963   5 1  East Africa Protectorate  In 1895 the British government took over and claimed the interior as far west as Lake Naivasha  it set up the East Africa Protectorate  The border was extended to Uganda in 1902  and in 1920 the enlarged protectorate  except for the original coastal strip  which remained a protectorate  became a crown colony  With the beginning of colonial rule in 1895  the Rift Valley and the surrounding Highlands became the enclave of white immigrants engaged in large scale coffee farming dependent on mostly Kikuyu labour  This area s fertile land has always made it the site of migration and conflict  There were no significant mineral resources—none of the gold or diamonds that attracted so many to South Africa   Imperial Germany set up a protectorate over the Sultan of Zanzibar s coastal possessions in 1885  followed by the arrival of Sir William Mackinnon s British East Africa Company  BEAC  in 1888  after the company had received a royal charter and concessionary rights to the Kenya coast from the Sultan of Zanzibar for a 50 year period  Incipient imperial rivalry was forestalled when Germany handed its coastal holdings to Britain in 1890  in exchange for German control over the coast of Tanganyika  The colonial takeover met occasionally with some strong local resistance  Waiyaki Wa Hinga  a Kikuyu chief who ruled Dagoretti who had signed a treaty with Frederick Lugard of the BEAC  having been subject to considerable harassment  burnt down Lugard s fort in 1890  Waiyaki was abducted two years later by the British and killed   Following severe financial difficulties of the British East Africa Company  the British government on 1 July 1895 established direct rule through the East African Protectorate  subsequently opening  1902  the fertile highlands to white settlers   5 1 1  Railway construction  A key to the development of Kenya s interior was the construction  started in 1895  of a railway from Mombasa to Kisumu  on Lake Victoria  completed in 1901  This was to be the first piece of the Uganda Railway  The British government had decided  primarily for strategic reasons  to build a railway linking Mombasa with the British protectorate of Uganda  A major feat of engineering  the  Uganda railway   that is the railway inside Kenya leading to Uganda  was completed in 1903 and was a decisive event in modernising the area  As governor of Kenya  Sir Percy Girouard was instrumental in initiating railway extension policy that led to construction of the Nairobi Thika and Konza Magadi railways   Some 32 000 workers were imported from British India to do the manual labour  Many stayed  as did most of the Indian traders and small businessmen who saw opportunity in the opening up of the interior of Kenya  Rapid economic development was seen as necessary to make the railway pay  and since the African population was accustomed to subsistence rather than export agriculture  the government decided to encourage European settlement in the fertile highlands  which had small African populations  The railway opened up the interior  not only to the European farmers  missionaries  and administrators  but also to systematic government programs to attack slavery  witchcraft  disease  and famine  The Africans saw witchcraft as a powerful influence on their lives and frequently took violent action against suspected witches  To control this  the British colonial administration passed laws  beginning in 1909  which made the practice of witchcraft illegal  These laws gave the local population a legal  nonviolent way to stem the activities of witches   By the time the railway was built  military resistance by the African population to the original British takeover had petered out  However new grievances were being generated by the process of European settlement  Governor Percy Girouard is associated with the debacle of the Second Maasai Agreement of 1911  which led to their forceful removal from the fertile Laikipia plateau to semi arid Ngong  To make way for the Europeans  largely Britons and whites from South Africa   the Maasai were restricted to the southern Loieta plains in 1913  The Kikuyu claimed some of the land reserved for Europeans and continued to feel that they had been deprived of their inheritance   In the initial stage of colonial rule  the administration relied on traditional communicators  usually chiefs  When colonial rule was established and efficiency was sought  partly because of settler pressure  newly educated younger men were associated with old chiefs in local Native Councils   In building the railway the British had to confront strong local opposition  especially from Koitalel Arap Samoei  a diviner and Nandi leader who prophesied that a black snake would tear through Nandi land spitting fire  which was seen later as the railway line  For ten years he fought against the builders of the railway line and train  The settlers were partly allowed in 1907 a voice in government through the legislative council  a European organisation to which some were appointed and others elected  But since most of the powers remained in the hands of the Governor  the settlers started lobbying to transform Kenya in a Crown Colony  which meant more powers for the settlers  They obtained this goal in 1920  making the Council more representative of European settlers  but Africans were excluded from direct political participation until 1944  when the first of them was admitted in the Council   5 1 2  World War I  Kenya became a military base for the British in the First World War  1914–1918   as efforts to subdue the German colony to the south were frustrated  At the outbreak of war in August 1914  the governors of British East Africa  as the Protectorate was generally known  and German East Africa agreed a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities  However Lt Col Paul von Lettow Vorbeck took command of the German military forces  determined to tie down as many British resources as possible  Completely cut off from Germany  von Lettow conducted an effective guerilla warfare campaign  living off the land  capturing British supplies  and remaining undefeated  He eventually surrendered in Zambia eleven days after the Armistice was signed in 1918  To chase von Lettow the British deployed Indian Army troops from India and then needed large numbers of porters to overcome the formidable logistics of transporting supplies far into the interior by foot  The Carrier Corps was formed and ultimately mobilised over 400 000 Africans  contributing to their long term politicisation   5 2  Kenya Colony  Before the war  African political focus was diffuse  But after the war  problems caused by new taxes and reduced wages and new settlers threatening African land led to new movements  The experiences gained by Africans in the war coupled with the creation of the white settler dominated Kenya Crown Colony  gave rise to considerable political activity in the 1920s which culminated in Archdeacon Owen s  Piny Owacho   Voice of the People  movement and the  Young Kikuyu Association   renamed the  East African Association   started in 1921 by Harry Thuku  1895–1970   which gave a sense of nationalism to many Kikuyu and advocated civil disobedience  From the 1920s  the Kikuyu Central Association  KCA  focused on unifying the Kikuyu into one geographic polity  but its project was undermined by controversies over ritual tribute  land allocation  the ban on female circumcision  and support for Thuku   Most political activity between the wars was local  and this succeeded most among the Luo of Kenya  where progressive young leaders became senior chiefs  By the later 1930s government began to intrude on ordinary Africans through marketing controls  stricter educational supervision  and land changes  Traditional chiefs became irrelevant and younger men became communicators by training in the missionary churches and civil service  Pressure on ordinary Kenyans by governments in a hurry to modernise in the 1930s to 1950s enabled the mass political parties to acquire support for  centrally  focused movements  but even these often relied on local communicators   During the early part of the 20th century  the interior central highlands were settled by British and other European farmers  who became wealthy farming coffee and tea  By the 1930s  approximately 30 000 white settlers lived in the area and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy  The area was already home to over a million members of the Kikuyu tribe  most of whom had no land claims in European terms  and lived as itinerant farmers  To protect their interests  the settlers banned the growing of coffee  introduced a hut tax  and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour  A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to provide a living from the land dwindled   5 2 1  Representation  Kenya became a focus of resettlement of young  upper class British officers after the war  giving a strong aristocratic tone to the white settlers  If they had £1000 in assets they could get a free   the goal of the government was to speed up modernisation and economic growth  They set up coffee plantations  which required expensive machinery  a stable labour force  and four years to start growing crops  The veterans did escape democracy and taxation in Britain  but they failed in their efforts to gain control of the colony  The upper class bias in migration policy meant that whites would always be a small minority  Many of them left after independence   Power remained concentrated in the governor s hands  weak legislative and executive councils made up of official appointees were created in 1906  The European settlers were allowed to elect representatives to the Legislative Council in 1920  when the colony was established  The white settlers  30 000 strong  sought  responsible government   in which they would have a voice  They opposed similar demands by the far more numerous Indian community  The European settlers gained representation for themselves and minimised representation on the Legislative Council for Indians and Arabs  The government appointed a European to represent African interests on the Council  In the  Devonshire declaration  of 1923 the Colonial Office declared that the interests of the Africans  comprising over 95% of the population  must be paramount—achieving that goal took four decades   5 2 2  World War II  In the Second World War  1939–45  Kenya became an important British military base for successful campaigns against Italy in the Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia  The war brought money and an opportunity for military service for 98 000 men  called  askaris   The war stimulated African nationalism  After the war  African ex servicemen sought to maintain the socioeconomic gains they had accrued through service in the King s African Rifles  KAR   Looking for middle class employment and social privileges  they challenged existing relationships within the colonial state  For the most part  veterans did not participate in national politics  believing that their aspirations could best be achieved within the confines of colonial society  The social and economic connotations of KAR service  combined with the massive wartime expansion of Kenyan defence forces  created a new class of modernised Africans with distinctive characteristics and interests  These socioeconomic perceptions proved powerful after the war   5 2 3  Rural trends  British officials sought to modernise Kikuyu farming in the Murang a District 1920–45  Relying on concepts of trusteeship and scientific management  they imposed a number of changes in crop production and agrarian techniques  claiming to promote conservation and  betterment  of farming in the colonial tribal reserves  While criticised as backward by British officials and white settlers  African farming proved resilient  and Kikuyu farmers engaged in widespread resistance to the colonial state s agrarian reforms   Modernisation was accelerated by the Second World War  Among the Luo the larger agricultural production unit was the patriarch s extended family  mainly divided into a special assignment team led by the patriarch  and the teams of his wives  who  together with their children  worked their own lots on a regular basis  This stage of development was no longer strictly traditional  but still largely self sufficient with little contact with the broader market  Pressures of overpopulation and the prospects of cash crops  already in evidence by 1945  made this subsistence economic system increasingly obsolete and accelerated a movement to commercial agriculture and emigration to cities  The Limitation of Action Act in 1968 sought to modernise traditional land ownership and use  the act has produced unintended consequences  with new conflicts raised over land ownership and social status   5 2 4  Kenya African Union  As a reaction to their exclusion from political representation  the Kikuyu people  the most subject to pressure by the settlers  founded in 1921 Kenya s first African political protest movement  the Young Kikuyu Association  led by Harry Thuku  After the Young Kikuyu Association was banned by the government  it was replaced by the Kikuyu Central Association in 1924   In 1944 Thuku founded and was first chairman of the multi tribal Kenya African Study Union  KASU   which in 1946 became the Kenya African Union  KAU   It was an African nationalist organisation that demanded access to white owned land  KAU acted as a constituency association for the first black member of Kenya s legislative council  Eliud Mathu  who had been nominated in 1944 by the governor after consulting élite African opinion  The KAU remained dominated by the Kikuyu ethnic group  In 1947 Jomo Kenyatta  former president of the moderate Kikuyu Central Association  became president of the more aggressive KAU to demand a greater political voice for Africans   In response to the rising pressures the British Colonial Office broadened the membership of the Legislative Council and increased its role  By 1952 a multiracial pattern of quotas allowed for 14 European  1 Arab  and 6 Asian elected members  together with an additional 6 African and 1 Arab member chosen by the governor  The council of ministers became the principal instrument of government in 1954   5 2 5  Mau Mau Uprising  A key watershed came from 1952 to 1956  during the Mau Mau Uprising  an armed local movement directed principally against the colonial government and the European settlers  It was the largest and most successful such movement in British Africa  The protest was supported almost exclusively by the Kikuyu  despite issues of land rights and anti European  anti Western appeals designed to attract other groups  The Mau Mau movement was also a bitter internal struggle among the Kikuyu  Harry Thuku said in 1952   To day we  the Kikuyu  stand ashamed and looked upon as hopeless people in the eyes of other races and before the Government  Why  Because of the crimes perpetrated by Mau Mau and because the Kikuyu have made themselves Mau Mau   The British killed over 12000 Mau Mau militants  Mau Mau carried out many atrocities with the violence on all sides reflecting the ferocity of the movement and the ruthlessness with which the British suppressed it  Kenyatta denied he was a leader of the Mau Mau but was convicted at trial and was sent to prison in 1953  gaining his freedom in 1961  To support its military campaign of counter insurgency the colonial government embarked on agrarian reforms that stripped white settlers of many of their former protections  for example  Africans were for the first time allowed to grow coffee  the major cash crop  Thuku was one of the first Kikuyu to win a coffee license  and in 1959 he became the first African board member of the Kenya Planters Coffee Union   5 2 6  Constitutional debates  After the suppression of the Mau Mau rising  the British provided for the election of the six African members to the Legislative Council under a weighted franchise based on education  The new colonial constitution of 1958 increased African representation  but African nationalists began to demand a democratic franchise on the principle of  one man  one vote   However  Europeans and Asians  because of their minority position  feared the effects of universal suffrage   At a conference held in 1960 in London  agreement was reached between the African members and the English settlers of the New Kenya Group  led by Michael Blundell  However many whites rejected the New Kenya Group and condemned the London agreement  because it moved away from racial quotas and toward independence  Following the agreement a new African party  the Kenya African National Union  KANU   with the slogan  Uhuru   or  Freedom   was formed under the leadership of Kikuyu leader James S  Gichuru and labour leader Tom Mboya  Mboya was a major figure from 1951 until his death in 1969  He was praised as nonethnic or antitribal  and attacked as an instrument of Western capitalism  Mboya as General Secretary of the Kenya Federation of Labor and a leader in the Kenya African National Union before and after independence skilfully managed the tribal factor in Kenyan economic and political life to succeed as a Luo in a predominantly Kikuyu movement  A split in KANU produced the breakaway rival party  the Kenya African Democratic Union  KADU   led by R  Ngala and M  Muliro  In the elections of February 1961  KANU won 19 of the 33 African seats while KADU won 11  twenty seats were reserved by quota for Europeans  Asians  and Arabs   Kenyatta was finally released in August and became president of KANU in October   In 1959  nationalist leader Tom Mboya began a program  funded by Americans  of sending talented youth to the United States for higher education  There was no university in Kenya at the time  but colonial officials opposed the program anyway  The next year Senator John F  Kennedy helped fund the program  which trained some 70% of the top leaders of the new nation  including the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize  environmentalist Wangari Maathai   6  Independence  In 1962  a KANU KADU coalition government  including both Kenyatta and Ngala  was formed  The 1962 constitution established a bicameral legislature consisting of a 117 member House of Representatives and a 41 member Senate  The country was divided into 7 semi autonomous regions  each with its own regional assembly  The quota principle of reserved seats for non Africans was abandoned  and open elections were held in May 1963  KADU gained control of the assemblies in the Rift Valley  Coast  and Western regions  KANU won majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives  and in the assemblies in the Central  Eastern  and Nyanza regions  Kenya now achieved internal self government with Jomo Kenyatta as its first president  The British and KANU agreed  over KADU protests  to constitutional changes in October 1963 strengthening the central government  Kenya attained independence on 12 Dec 1963 as a Commonwealth realm with Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State  In 1964 Kenya became a republic  and constitutional changes further centralised the government   The British government bought out the white settlers and they mostly left Kenya  The Indian minority dominated retail business in the cities and most towns  but was deeply distrusted by the Africans  As a result 120 000 of the 176 000 Indians kept their old British passports rather than become citizens of an independent Kenya  large numbers left Kenya  most of them headed to Britain   6 1  Kenyatta tenure  1963–1978   Once in power Kenyatta swerved from radical nationalism to conservative bourgeois politics  The plantations formerly owned by white settlers were broken up and given to farmers  with the Kikuyu the favoured recipients  along with their allies the Embu and the Meru  By 1978 most of the country s wealth and power was in the hands of the organisation which grouped these three tribes  the Gikuyu Embu Meru Association  GEMA   together comprising 30% of the population  At the same time the Kikuyu  with Kenyatta s support  spread beyond their traditional territorial homelands and repossessed lands  stolen by the whites  – even when these had previously belonged to other groups  The other groups  a 70% majority  were outraged  setting up long term ethnic animosities   The minority party  the Kenya African Democratic Union  KADU   representing a coalition of small tribes that had feared dominance by larger ones  dissolved itself voluntarily in 1964 and former members joined KANU  KANU was the only party 1964–1966 when a faction broke away as the Kenya People s Union  KPU   It was led by Jaramogi Oginga Odinga  a former vice president and Luo elder  KPU advocated a more  scientific  route to socialism—criticising the slow progress in land redistribution and employment opportunities—as well as a realignment of foreign policy in favour of the Soviet Union  In June 1969 Tom Mboya  a Luo member of the government considered a potential successor to Kenyatta  was assassinated  Hostility between Kikuyu and Luo was heightened  and after riots broke out in Luo country KPU was banned  The government used a variety of political and economic measures to harass the KPU and its prospective and actual members  KPU branches were unable to register  KPU meetings were prevented  and civil servants and politicians suffered severe economic and political consequences for joining the KPU  Kenya thereby became a one party state under KANU   Ignoring his suppression of the opposition and continued factionalism within KANU the imposition of one party rule allowed Mzee   Old Man   Kenyatta  who had led the country since independence  claimed he achieved  political stability   Underlying social tensions were evident  however  Kenya s very rapid population growth rate and considerable rural to urban migration were in large part responsible for high unemployment and disorder in the cities  There also was much resentment by blacks at the privileged economic position in the country of Asians and Europeans   At Kenyatta s death  22 August 1978   Vice President Daniel arap Moi became interim President  On 14 October  Moi formally became President after he was elected head of KANU and designated its sole nominee  In June 1982  the National Assembly amended the constitution  making Kenya officially a one party state  On 1 August members of the Kenyan Air Force launched an attempted coup  which was quickly suppressed by Loyalist forces led by the Army  the General Service Unit  GSU  – paramilitary wing of the police – and later the regular police  but not without civilian casualties   6 1 1  Foreign policies  Independent Kenya  although officially non aligned  adopted a pro Western stance  Kenya worked unsuccessfully for East African union  the proposal to unite Kenya  Tanzania  and Uganda did not win approval  However  the three nations did form a loose East African Community  EAC  in 1967  that maintained the customs union and some common services that they had shared under British rule  The EAC collapsed in 1977 and it was officially dissolved in 1984  Kenya s relations with Somalia deteriorated over the problem of Somalis in the North Eastern Province who tried to secede and were supported by Somalia  In 1968  however  Kenya and Somalia agreed to restore normal relations  and the Somali rebellion effectively ended   6 2  Moi regime  1978–2002   Kenyatta died in 1978 and was succeeded by Daniel Arap Moi  b  1924  who ruled as President 1978–2002  Moi  a member of the Kalenjin ethnic group  quickly consolidated his position and governed in an authoritarian and corrupt manner  By 1986  Moi had concentrated all the power – and most of its attendant economic benefits – into the hands of his Kalenjin tribe and of a handful of allies from minority groups   On 1 August 1982  lower level Air Force personnel  led by Senior Private Grade I Hezekiah Ochuka and backed by university students  attempted a coup d état to oust Moi  The putsch was quickly suppressed by forces commanded by Chief of General Staff Mahamoud Mohamed  a veteran Somali military official  In the coup s aftermath  some of Nairobi s poor Kenyans attacked and looted stores owned by Asians  Robert Ouko  the senior Luo in Moi s cabinet  was appointed to expose corruption at high levels  but was murdered a few months later  Moi s closest associate was implicated in Ouko s murder  Moi dismissed him but not before his remaining Luo support had evaporated  Germany recalled its ambassador to protest the  increasing brutality  of the regime  and foreign donors pressed Moi to allow other parties  which was done in December 1991 through a constitutional amendment   On the heels of the Garissa Massacre of 1980  Kenyan troops committed the Wagalla massacre in 1984 against thousands of civilians in the North Eastern Province  An official probe into the atrocities was later ordered in 2011   6 2 1  Multi party politics  After local and foreign pressure  in December 1991  parliament repealed the one party section of the constitution  The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy  FORD  emerged as the leading opposition to KANU  and dozens of leading KANU figures switched parties  But FORD  led by Oginga Odinga  1911–1994   a Luo  and Kenneth Matiba  a Kikuyu  split into two ethnically based factions  In the first open presidential elections in a quarter century  in December 1992  Moi won with 37% of the vote  Matiba received 26%  Mwai Kibaki  of the mostly Kikuyu Democratic Party  19%  and Odinga 18%  In the Assembly  KANU won 97 of the 188 seats at stake  Moi s government in 1993 agreed to economic reforms long urged by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  which restored enough aid for Kenya to service its $7 5 billion foreign debt   Obstructing the press both before and after the 1992 elections  Moi continually maintained that multiparty politics would only promote tribal conflict  His own regime depended upon exploitation of inter group hatreds  Under Moi  the apparatus of clientage and control was underpinned by the system of powerful provincial commissioners  each with a bureaucratic hierarchy based on chiefs  and their police  that was more powerful than the elected members of parliament  Elected local councils lost most of their power  and the provincial bosses were answerable only to the central government  which in turn was dominated by the president  The emergence of mass opposition in 1990–91 and demands for constitutional reform were met by rallies against pluralism  The regime leaned on the support of the Kalenjin and incited the Maasai against the Kiyuku  Government politicians denounced the Kikuyu as traitors  obstructed their registration as voters  and threatened them with dispossession  In 1993 and after  mass evictions of Kikuyu took place  often with the direct involvement of army  police  and game rangers  Armed clashes and many casualties  including deaths  resulted   Further liberalisation in November 1997 allowed the expansion of political parties from 11 to 26  President Moi won re election as President in the December 1997 elections  and his KANU Party narrowly retained its parliamentary majority   Moi ruled using a strategic mixture of ethnic favouritism  state repression  and marginalisation of opposition forces  He utilised detention and torture  looted public finances  and appropriated land and other property  Moi sponsored irregular army units that attacked the Luo  Luhya  and Kikuyu communities  and he disclaimed responsibility by assigning the violence to ethnic clashes arising from a land dispute  Beginning in 1998  Moi engaged in a carefully calculated strategy to manage the presidential succession in his and his party s favour  Faced with the challenge of a new  multiethnic political coalition  Moi shifted the axis of the 2002 electoral contest from ethnicity to the politics of generational conflict  The strategy backfired  ripping his party wide open and resulting in its humiliating defeat of his candidate  Kenyatta s son  in the December 2002 general elections   6 3  Recent history  2002 to present   6 3 1  2002 elections  Constitutionally barred from running in the December 2002 presidential elections  Moi unsuccessfully promoted Uhuru Kenyatta  the son of Kenya s first President  as his successor  A rainbow coalition of opposition parties routed the ruling KANU party  and its leader  Moi s former vice president Mwai Kibaki  was elected President by a large majority   On 27 December 2002  by 62% the voters overwhelmingly elected members of the National Rainbow Coalition  NaRC  to parliament and NaRC candidate Mwai Kibaki  b  1931  to the presidency  Voters rejected the Kenya African National Union s  KANU  presidential candidate  Uhuru Kenyatta  the handpicked candidate of outgoing president Moi  International and local observers reported the 2002 elections to be generally more fair and less violent than those of both 1992 and 1997  His strong showing allowed Kibaki to choose a cabinet  to seek international support  and to balance power within the NaRC   6 3 2  Economic trends  Kenya witnessed a spectacular economic recovery  helped by a favourable international environment  The annual rate of growth improved from −1 6% in 2002 to 2 6% by 2004  3 4% in 2005  and 5 5% in 2007  However  social inequalities also increased  the economic benefits went disproportionately to the already well off  especially to the Kikuyu   corruption reached new depths  matching some of the excesses of the Moi years  Social conditions deteriorated for ordinary Kenyans  who faced a growing wave of routine crime in urban areas  pitched battles between ethnic groups fighting for land  and a feud between the police and the Mungiki sect  which left over 120 people dead in May–November 2007 alone   6 3 3  2007 elections and ethnic violence  Once regarded as the world s  most optimistic   Kibaki s regime quickly lost much of its power because it became too closely linked with the discredited Moi forces  The continuity between Kibaki and Moi set the stage for the self destruction of Kibaki s National Rainbow Coalition  which was dominated by Kikuyus  The western Luo and Kalenjin groups  demanding greater autonomy  backed Raila Amolo Odinga  1945–   and his Orange Democratic Movement  ODM    In the December 2007 elections  Odinga  the candidate of the ODM  attacked the failures of the Kibaki regime  The ODM charged the Kikuyu have grabbed everything and all the other tribes have lost  that Kibaki had betrayed his promises for change  that crime and violence were out of control  and that economic growth was not bringing any benefits to the ordinary citizen  In the December 2007 elections the ODM won majority seats in Parliament  but the presidential elections votes were marred by claims of rigging by both sides  It may never be clear who won the elections  but it was roughly 50 50 before the rigging started    Majimboism  was a philosophy that emerged in the 1950s  meaning federalism or regionalism in Swahili  and it was intended to protect local rights  especially regarding land ownership  Today  majimboism  is code for certain areas of the country to be reserved for specific ethnic groups  fuelling the kind of ethnic cleansing that has swept the country since the election  Majimboism has always had a strong following in the Rift Valley  the epicenter of the recent violence  where many locals have long believed that their land was stolen by outsiders  The December 2007 election was in part a referendum on majimboism  It pitted today s majimboists  represented by Odinga  who campaigned for regionalism  against Kibaki  who stood for the status quo of a highly centralised government that has delivered considerable economic growth but has repeatedly displayed the problems of too much power concentrated in too few hands – corruption  aloofness  favouritism and its flip side  marginalisation  In the town of Londiani in the Rift Valley  Kikuyu traders settled decades ago  In February 2008  hundreds of Kalenjin raiders poured down from the nearby scruffy hills and burned a Kikuyu school  Three hundred thousand members of the Kikuyu community were displaced from Rift Valley province  Kikuyus quickly took revenge  organising into gangs armed with iron bars and table legs and hunting down Luos and Kalenjins in Kikuyu dominated areas like Nakuru   We are achieving our own perverse version of majimboism   wrote one of Kenya’s leading columnists  Macharia Gaitho   The Luo population of the southwest had enjoyed an advantageous position during the late colonial and early independence periods of the 1950s  1960s  and early 1970s  particularly in terms of the prominence of its modern elite compared to those of other groups  However the Luo lost prominence due to the success of Kikuyu and related groups  Embu and Meru  in gaining and exercising political power during the Jomo Kenyatta era  1963–1978   While measurements of poverty and health by the early 2000s showed the Luo disadvantaged relative to other Kenyans  the growing presence of non Luo in the professions reflected a dilution of Luo professionals due to the arrival of others rather than an absolute decline in the Luo numbers   6 3 4  Demographic trends  Between 1980 and 2000 total fecundity in Kenya fell by about 40%  from some eight births per woman to around five  During the same period  fertility in Uganda declined by less than 10%  The difference was due primarily to greater contraceptive use in Kenya  though in Uganda there was also a reduction in pathological sterility  The Demographic and Health Surveys carried out every five years show that women in Kenya wanted fewer children than those in Uganda and that in Uganda there was also a greater unmet need for contraception  These differences may be attributed  in part at least  to the divergent paths of economic development followed by the two countries since independence and to the Kenya government s active promotion of family planning  which the Uganda government did not promote until 1995   7  See also  Colonial Heads of Kenya  Heads
