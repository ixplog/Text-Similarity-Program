Theodicy     in its most common form  is the attempt to answer the question of why a good God permits the manifestation of evil  Theodicy attempts to resolve the evidential problem of evil by reconciling the traditional divine characteristics of omnibenevolence  omnipotence  and omniscience  in either their absolute or relative form  with the occurrence of evil or suffering in the world  Unlike a defense  which tries to demonstrate that God s existence is logically possible in the light of evil  a theodicy provides a framework which claims to make God s existence probable  The term was coined in 1710 by German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz in his work  Théodicée  though various responses to the problem of evil had been previously proposed  The British philosopher John Hick traced the history of moral theodicy in his work  Evil and the God of Love  identifying three major traditions  the Plotinian theodicy  named after Plotinus  the Augustinian theodicy  which Hick based on the writings of Augustine of Hippo  and the Irenaean theodicy  which Hick developed  based on the thinking of St Irenaeus  Other philosophers have suggested that theodicy is a modern discipline because deities in the ancient world were often imperfect   German philosopher Max Weber saw theodicy as a social problem  based on the human need to explain puzzling aspects of the world  sociologist Peter L  Berger argued that religion arose out of a need for social order  and theodicy developed to sustain it  Following the Holocaust  a number of Jewish theologians developed a new response to the problem of evil  sometimes called anti theodicy  which maintains that God cannot be meaningfully justified  As an alternative to theodicy  a defence may be proposed  which is limited to showing the logical possibility of God s existence  American philosopher Alvin Plantinga presented a version of the free will defence which argued that the coexistence of God and evil is not logically impossible  and that free will further explains the existence of evil without threatening the existence of God  Similar to a theodicy  a cosmodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the universe  and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the goodness of humanity   1  Definition and etymology  As defined by Alvin Plantinga  theodicy is the  answer to the question of why God permits evil   Theodicy is defined as a theological construct that attempts to vindicate God in response to the evidential problem of evil that militates against the existence of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent deity  The word theodicy derives from the Greek words Θεός Τheos and δίκη dikē  Theos is translated  God  and dikē can be translated as either  trial  or  judgement   Thus  theodicy literally means “justifying God ”  In the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy  Nick Trakakis proposed an additional three requirements which must be contained within a theodicy   Common sense views of the world   Widely held historical and scientific opinion   Plausible moral principles  As a response to the problem of evil  a theodicy is distinct from a defence  A defence attempts to demonstrate that the occurrence of evil does not contradict God s existence  but it does not propose that rational beings are able to understand why God permits evil  A theodicy seeks to show that it is reasonable to believe in God despite evidence of evil in the world and offers a framework which can account for why evil exists  A theodicy is often based on a prior natural theology  which attempts to prove the existence of God  and seeks to demonstrate that God s existence remains probable after the problem of evil is posed by giving a justification for God s permitting evil to happen  Defences propose solutions to the logical problem of evil  while theodicies attempt to answer the evidential problem   2  Reasons for theodicy  German philosopher Max Weber interpreted theodicy as a social problem  and viewed theodicy as a  problem of meaning   Weber argued that  as human society became increasingly rational  the need to explain why good people suffered and evil people prospered became more important because religion casts the world as a  meaningful cosmos   Weber framed the problem of evil as the dilemma that the good can suffer and the evil can prosper  which became more important as religion became more sophisticated  He identified two purposes of theodicy  to explain why good people suffer  a theodicy of suffering   and why people prosper  a theodicy of good fortune   A theodicy of good fortune seeks to justify the good fortune of people in society  Weber believed that those who are successful are not satisfied unless they can justify why they deserve to be successful  For theodicies of suffering  Weber argued that three different kinds of theodicy emerged—predestination  dualism  and karma—all of which attempt to satisfy the human need for meaning  and he believed that the quest for meaning  when considered in light of suffering  becomes the problem of suffering   Sociologist Peter L  Berger characterised religion as the human attempt to build order out of a chaotic world  He believed that humans could not accept that anything in the world was meaningless and saw theodicy as an assertion that the cosmos has meaning and order  despite evidence to the contrary  Berger presented an argument similar to that of Weber  but suggested that the need for theodicy arose primarily out of the situation of human society  He believed that theodicies existed to allow individuals to transcend themselves  denying the individual in favour of the social order   3  History  The term theodicy was coined by German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz in his 1710 work  written in French  Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu  la liberté de l homme et l origine du mal  Theodicy  Essays on the Goodness of God  the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil   Leibniz s Théodicée was a response to skeptical Protestant philosopher Pierre Bayle  who wrote in his work Dictionnaire Historique et Critique that  after rejecting three attempts to solve it  he saw no rational solution to the problem of evil  Bayle argued that  because the Bible asserts the coexistence of God and evil  this state of affairs must simply be accepted   French philosopher Voltaire criticised Leibniz s concept of theodicy in his Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne  Poem on the Lisbon disaster   suggesting that the massive destruction of innocent lives caused by the Lisbon earthquake demonstrated that God was not providing the  best of all possible worlds   Voltaire also includes the earthquake theodicy theme in his novel  Candide   In The Catholic Encyclopedia  1914   Constantine Kempf argued that  following Leibniz s work  philosophers called their works on the problem of evil  theodicies   and philosophy about God was brought under the discipline of theodicy  He argued that theodicy began to include all of natural theology  meaning that theodicy came to consist of the human knowledge of God through the systematic use of reason   In 1966  British philosopher John Hick published Evil and the God of Love  in which he surveyed various Christian responses to the problem of evil  before developing his own  In his work  Hick identified and distinguished between three types of theodicy  Plotinian  which was named after Plotinus  Augustinian  which had dominated Western Christianity for many centuries  and Irenaean  which was developed by the Eastern Church Father Irenaeus  a version of which Hick subscribed to himself   In his dialogue  Is God a Taoist    published in 1977 in his book  The Tao is Silent   Raymond Smullyan proves that it is logically impossible to have sentient beings without allowing evil  even for God  just as it is impossible for him to create a triangle in the Euclidean plane having an angular sum other than 180°  So the capability of feeling implies free will  which in turn may produce evil  understood here as hurting other sentient beings  The problem of evil happening to good people is not addressed directly here  but both reincarnation and karma are hinted at   3 1  Ancient religions  Dr Philip Irving Mitchell of the Dallas Baptist University notes that some philosophers have cast the pursuit of theodicy as a modern one  as earlier scholars used the problem of evil to support the existence of one particular god over another  explain wisdom  or explain a conversion  rather than to justify God s goodness  Professor Sarah Iles Johnston argues that ancient civilizations  such as the ancient Mesopotamians  Greeks  Romans  and Egyptians held polytheistic beliefs that may have enabled them to deal with the concept of theodicy differently  These religions taught the existence of many gods and goddesses who controlled various aspects of daily life  These early religions may have avoided the question of theodicy by endowing their deities with the same flaws and jealousies that plagued humanity  No one god or goddess was fundamentally good or evil  this explained that bad things could happen to good people if they angered a deity because the gods could exercise the same free will that humankind possesses  Such religions taught that some gods were more inclined to be helpful and benevolent  while others were more likely to be spiteful and aggressive  In this sense  the evil gods could be blamed for misfortune  while the good gods could be petitioned with prayer and sacrifices to make things right  There was still a sense of justice in that individuals that were right with the gods could avoid punishment   3 2  Biblical theodicy  The biblical account of the justification of evil and suffering in the presence of God has both similarities and contrasts in the Hebrew bible and the Greek bible of the New Testament  For the Hebrew bible  the Book of Job is often quoted as the authoritative source of discussion   On the question of the absolute or relative form of the issue of theodicy prevailing in biblical theology as such  the prevailing account is predominantly in the relative form of theodicy in general  The Book of Isaiah in chapter 45 states  This does not allow the absolute form of omnibenevolence required for the consideration of the absolute form of theodicy in general  A similar account is found in the New Testament epistles where in 2 Thessalonians 1 8 9  King James Version  the distinction between the elect of God and the non elect is clearly distinguished stating   In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God  and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ   Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord  and from the glory of his power   Therein everlasting punishment upon the non elect does not allow the absolute form of omnibenevolence required for the absolute form of theodicy when discussed on the basis of the New Testament narratives as well   3 3  Augustinian theodicy  The Protestant and Reformed reading of Augustinian theodicy  as promoted primarily by John Hick  is based on the writings of Augustine of Hippo  a Christian philosopher and theologian who lived from AD 354 to 430  The catholic  pre Reformation  formulation of the same issue is substantially different and is outlined below  In Hick s approach  this form of theodicy argues that evil does not exist except as a privation—or corruption of—goodness  and therefore God did not create evil  Augustinian scholars have argued that God created the world perfectly  with no evil or human suffering  Evil entered the world through the disobedience of Adam and Eve and the theodicy casts the existence of evil as a just punishment for this original sin  The theodicy argues that humans have an evil nature in as much as it is deprived of its original goodness  form  order  and measure due to the inherited original sin of Adam and Eve  but still ultimately remains good due to existence coming from God  for if a nature was completely evil  deprived of the good   it would cease to exist  It maintains that God remains blameless and good   In the catholic reading of Augustine  the issue of just war as developed in his book The City of God substantially established his position concerning the positive justification of killing  suffering and pain as inflicted upon an enemy when encountered in war for a just cause  Augustine asserted that peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin  Defense of one s self or others could be a necessity  especially when authorized by a legitimate authority  While not elaborating the conditions necessary for war to be just  Augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase  itself  in his work The City of God  In essence  the pursuit of peace must include the option of fighting with all of its eventualities in order to preserve peace in the long term  Such a war could not be pre emptive  but defensive  to restore peace  Thomas Aquinas  centuries later  used the authority of Augustine s arguments in an attempt to define the conditions under which a war could be just   3 4  Irenaean theodicy  Irenaeus  died c  202   born in the early second century  expressed ideas which explained the existence of evil as necessary for human development  Irenaeus argued that human creation comprised two parts  humans were made first in the image  then in the likeness  of God  The image of God consists of having the potential to achieve moral perfection  whereas the likeness of God is the achievement of that perfection  To achieve moral perfection  Irenaeus suggested that humans must have free will  To achieve such free will  humans must experience suffering and God must be at an epistemic distance  a distance of knowledge  from humanity  Therefore  evil exists to allow humans to develop as moral agents  In the twentieth century  John Hick collated the ideas of Irenaeus into a distinct theodicy  He argued that the world exists as a  vale of soul making   a phrase that he drew from John Keats   and that suffering and evil must therefore occur  He argued that human goodness develops through the experience of evil and suffering   3 5  Origenian theodicy  In direct response to John Hick s description of theodicy  Mark Scott has indicated that neither Augustine nor Irenaeus provide an appropriate context for the discussion of Hick s theistic version of theodicy  As a theologian supporting universal salvation among the discredited Church Fathers  Origen provides a more direct theological comparison for the discussion of Hick s presentation of universal salvation and theodicy  Neither Irenaeus nor Augustine endorsed a theology of universal salvation in any form comparable to that of John Hick   3 6  Relatively minor theodicies  Michael Martin summarizes what he calls “relatively minor” theodicies   4  Alternatives  4 1  Jewish anti theodicy  In 1998  Jewish theologian Zachary Braiterman coined the term anti theodicy in his book  God  After Auschwitz to describe Jews  both in a biblical and post Holocaust context  whose response to the problem of evil is protest and refusal to investigate the relationship between God and suffering  An anti theodicy acts in opposition to a theodicy and places full blame for all experience of evil onto God  but must rise from an individual s belief in and love of God  Anti theodicy has been likened to Job s protests in the Book of Job  Braiterman wrote that an anti theodicy rejects the idea that there is a meaningful relationship between God and evil or that God could be justified for the experience of evil   The Holocaust prompted a reconsideration of theodicy in some Jewish circles  French Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas  who had himself been a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany  declared theodicy to be  blasphemous   arguing that it is the  source of all immorality   and demanded that the project of theodicy be ended  Levinas asked whether the idea of absolutism survived after the Holocaust  which he proposed it did  He argued that humans are not called to justify God in the face of evil  but to attempt to live godly lives  rather than considering whether God was present during the Holocaust  the duty of humans is to build a world where goodness will prevail   Professor of theology David R  Blumenthal  in his book Facing the Abusing God  supports the  theology of protest   which he saw as presented in the play  The Trial of God  He supports the view that survivors of the Holocaust cannot forgive God and so must protest about it  Blumenthal believes that a similar theology is presented in the book of Job  in which Job does not question God s existence or power  but his morality and justice  Other prominent voices in the Jewish tradition commenting on the justification of God in the presence of the Holocaust have been the Nobel prize winning author Elie Wiesel and Richard L  Rubinstein in his book The Cunning of History   4 2  Christian alternatives to theodicy  A number of Christian writers oppose theodicies  Todd Billings deems constructing theodicies to be a “destructive practice ” In the same vein  Nick Trakakis observes that “theodical discourse can only add to the world’s evils  not remove or illuminate them ” As an alternative to theodicy  some theologians have advocated “reflection on tragedy” as a more befitting reply to evil  For example  Wendy Farley believes that “a desire for justice” and “anger and pity at suffering” should replace “theodicy’s cool justifications of evil ” Sarah K  Pinnock opposes abstract theodicies that would legitimize evil and suffering  However  she endorses theodicy discussions in which people ponder God  evil  and suffering from a practical faith perspective   Karl Barth viewed the evil of human suffering as ultimately in the “control of divine providence ” Given this view  Barth deemed it impossible for humans to devise a theodicy that establishes  the idea of the goodness of God   For Barth only the crucifixion could establish the goodness of God  In the crucifixion  God bears and suffers what humanity suffers  This suffering by God Himself makes human theodicies anticlimactic  Barth found a “twofold justification” in the crucifixion  the justification of sinful humanity and “the justification in which God justifies Himself ”  Christian Science offers a rational  though widely unacceptable  solution to the problem by denying that evil ultimately exists  Eddy  and Mark Twain had some contrasting views on theodicy and suffering  which are well described by Stephen Gottschalk  Gottschalk authored an essay  Theodicy after Auschwitz and the Reality of God   Union Seminary Quarterly Review 1987  nos  3–4  pp  77–91   4 3  Free will defense  As an alternative to a theodicy  a defence may be offered as a response to the problem of evil  A defence attempts to show that God s existence is not made logically impossible by the existence of evil  it does not need to be true or plausible  merely logically possible  American philosopher Alvin Plantinga offers a free will defence which argues that human free will sufficiently explains the existence of evil while maintaining that God s existence remains logically possible  He argues that  if God s existence and the existence of evil are to be logically inconsistent  a premise must be provided which  if true  would make them inconsistent  as none has been provided  the existence of God and evil must be consistent  Free will furthers this argument by providing a premise which  in conjunction with the existence of evil  entails that God s existence remains consistent  A common rebuttal to this defence is the inconsistency between omniscience and free will  If God is omniscient  then humans merely have the illusion of free will  Since the Bible states that God created humans  it logically follows that God created humans with the knowledge of every action and decision that they will make  The question of who then is ultimately responsible for evil points back towards God   4 4  Cosmodicy and anthropodicy  A cosmodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the universe in the face of evil  and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of human nature in the face of the evils produced by humans   Considering the relationship between theodicy and cosmodicy  Johannes van der Ven argued that the choice between theodicy and cosmodicy is a false dilemma  Philip E  Devenish proposed what he described as  a nuanced view in which theodicy and cosmodicy are rendered complementary  rather than alternative concepts   Theologian J  Matthew Ashley described the relationship between theodicy  cosmodicy and anthropodicy   Cosmodicy has been identified as a major theme in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche   5
