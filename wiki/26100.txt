The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—People s Army    FARC–EP and FARC  are a guerilla organization involved in the continuing Colombian armed conflict since 1964  It has been known to employ a variety of military tactics in addition to more unconventional methods including terrorism  The FARC EP have a claim to be an army of peasant Marxist–Leninists with a political platform of agrarianism and anti imperialism  The operations of the FARC–EP are funded by kidnap to ransom  illegal mining  extortion and or taxation of various forms of economic activity and the production and distribution of illegal drugs  As of the early 21st century the organization has seemingly been returning to more traditional a methodology of guerilla warfare  including hit and run attacks while also having released all its kidnapped civilians   The strength of the FARC–EP forces is indeterminate  in 2007  the FARC said they were an armed force of 18 000 men and women  in 2010  the Colombian military calculated that FARC forces consisted of approximately 13 800 members  50 per cent of which were armed guerrilla combatants  and  in 2011  the President of Colombia  Juan Manuel Santos  said that FARC–EP forces comprised fewer than 10 000 members  In 2013 it was reported that 26 648 FARC and ELN members had decided to demobilize since 2002  According to a report from Human Rights Watch  approximately 20–30% of the recruits are minors  most of whom are forced to join the FARC  The greatest concentrations of FARC terrorist forces are in the south eastern regions of Colombia s of jungle  in the plains at the base of the Andean mountain chain and in northwestern Colombia  However  the FARC and the ELN  National Liberation Army of Colombia  lost control of the territory  forcing them to hide primarily in remote areas in the jungle   In 1964  the FARC–EP were established as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party  Partido Comunista Colombiano  PCC   after the Colombian military attacked rural Communist enclaves in the aftermath of The Violence  La Violencia  ca  1948–58   The FARC are a violent non state actor  VNSA  whose formal recognition as legitimate belligerent forces is disputed by some organizations  As such  the FARC has been classified as a terrorist organization by the governments of Colombia  the United States  Canada  Chile  New Zealand  and the European Union  whereas the governments of Venezuela  Brazil  Argentina  Ecuador  and Nicaragua do not  In 2008  Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez recognized the FARC EP as a proper army  President Chávez also asked the Colombian government and their allies to recognize the FARC as a belligerent force  arguing that such political recognition would oblige the FARC to forgo kidnapping and terrorism as methods of civil war and to abide by the Geneva Convention  Juan Manuel Santos  the current President of Colombia  has followed a middle path by recognizing in 2011 that there is an  armed conflict  in Colombia although his predecessor  Alvaro Uribe  strongly disagreed  In 2012  FARC announced they would no longer participate in kidnappings for ransom and released the last 10 soldiers and police officers they kept as prisoners but it has kept silent about the status of hundreds of civilians still reported as hostages  but continued kidnapping soldiers and civilians  In February 2008  millions of Colombians demonstrated against the FARC   In 2012  the FARC made 239 attacks on the energy infrastructure  However  the FARC have shown signs of fatigue  Also the FARC are  as of 2014  not seeking to engage in outright combat with the army  instead concentrating on small scale ambushes against isolated army units  Meanwhile  since 2008  the FARC have opted to attack police patrols with home made mortars  sniper rifles and explosives  as they are not considered strong enough to engage police units directly  This follows the trend of the 1990s during the strengthening of the Government forces  Currently the FARC and the Colombian Government are in peace talks in the city of Havana in Cuba  despite FARC failing to follow their own peace offers and ceasefires and repeatedly stating they won t stop their arms race   1  History  1 1  La Violencia and the National Front  In 1948  in the aftermath of the assassination of the populist politician Jorge Eliécer Gaitán  there occurred a decade of large scale political violence throughout Colombia  which was a Conservative – Liberal civil war that killed more than 200 000 people  In Colombian history and culture  the killings are known as La Violencia  The Violence  1948–58   most of the people killed were peasants and laborers in rural Colombia  In 1957–1958  the political leadership of the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party agreed to establish a bipartisan political system known as the National Front  Frente Nacional  1958–74   The Liberal and the Conservative parties agreed to alternate in the exercise of government power by presenting a joint National Front candidate to each election and restricting the participation of other political movements  The pact was ratified as a constitutional amendment by a national plebiscite on 1 December 1957 and was supported by the Roman Catholic Church as well as Colombia s business leaders  The initial power sharing agreement was effective until 1974  nonetheless  with modifications  the Liberal–Conservative bipartisan system lasted until 1990  The sixteen year extension of the bipartisan power sharing agreement permitted the Liberal and Conservative élites to consolidate their socioeconomic control of Colombian society  and to strengthen the military to suppress political reform and radical politics proposing alternative forms of government for Colombia   During the 1960s  the Colombian government effected a policy of Accelerated Economic Development  AED   the agribusiness plan of Lauchlin Currie  a Canadian born U S economist who owned ranching land in Colombia  The plan promoted industrial farming that would produce great yields of agricultural and animal products for world wide exportation  while the Colombian government would provide subsidies to large scale private farms  The AED policy came at the expense of the small scale family farms that only yielded food supplies for local consumption  Based on a legalistic interpretation of what constituted  efficient use  of the land  thousands of peasants were forcefully evicted from their farms and migrated to the cities  where they became part of the industrial labor pool  In 1961  the dispossession of farmland had produced 40 000 landless families and by 1969 their numbers amounted to 400 000 throughout Colombia  By 1970  the latifundio type of industrial farm  more than 50 hectares in area  occupied more than 77 per cent of arable land in the country  The AED policy increased the concentration of land ownership among cattle ranchers and urban industrialists  whose businesses expanded their profits as a result of reductions in the cost of labor wages after the influx of thousands of displaced peasants into the cities  During this period  most rural workers lacked basic medical care and malnutrition was almost universal  which increased the rates of preventable disease and infant mortality   1 2  PCC and self defense communities  Communists were active throughout rural and urban Colombia in the period immediately following World War I  The Colombian Communist Party  Partido Comunista Colombiano  PCC  was formally accredited by the Comintern in 1930  The PCC began establishing  peasant leagues  in rural areas and  popular fronts  in urban areas  calling for improved living and working conditions  education  and rights for the working class  These groups began networking together to present a defensive front against the state supported violence of large landholders  Members organized strikes  protests  seizures of land  and organized communist controlled  self defense communities  in southern Colombia that were able to resist state military forces  while providing for the subsistence needs of the populace  Many of the PCC s attempts at organizing peasants were met with violent repression by the Colombian government and the landowning class  U S  military intelligence estimated that in 1962  the size of the PCC had grown to 8 000 to 10 000 active members  and an additional 28 000 supporters   In 1961  a guerrilla leader and long time PCC organizer named Manuel Marulanda Vélez declared an independent  Republic of Marquetalia   The Lleras government attempted unsuccessfully to attack the communities to drive out the guerrillas  due to fears that  a Cuban style revolutionary situation might develop   After the failed attacks  several army outposts were set up in the area   1 3  Plan Lazo  In October 1959  the United States sent a  Special Survey Team  composed of counterinsurgency experts to investigate Colombia s internal security situation  Among other policy recommendations the US team advised that  in order to shield the interests of both Colombian and US authorities against  interventionist  charges any special aid given for internal security was to be sterile and covert in nature   In February 1962  three years after the 1959  US Special Survey Team   a Fort Bragg top level U S  Special Warfare team headed by Special Warfare Center commander General William P  Yarborough  visited Colombia for a second survey   In a secret supplement to his report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Yarborough encouraged the creation and deployment of a US backed force to commit  paramilitary  sabotage and or terrorist activities against known communist proponents    The new counter insurgency policy was instituted as Plan Lazo in 1962 and called for both military operations and civic action programs in violent areas  Following Yarborough s recommendations  the Colombian military recruited civilians into  civil defense  groups which worked alongside the military in its counter insurgency campaign  as well as in civilian intelligence networks to gather information on guerrilla activity  Doug Stokes argues that it was not until the early part of the 1980s that the Colombian government attempted to move away from the counterinsurgency strategy represented by Plan Lazo and Yarborough s 1962 recommendations   The Colombian government began attacking many of the communist groups in the early 1960s  attempting to re assimilate the territories under the control of the national government  FARC was formed in 1964 by Manuel Marulanda Vélez and other PCC members  after a military attack on the community of Marquetalia  16 000 Colombian troops attacked the community  which only had 48 armed fighters  Marulanda and 47 others fought against government forces at Marquetalia  and then escaped into the mountains along with the other fighters  These 48 men formed the core of FARC  which later grew in size to hundreds of fighters   1 4  Seventh Guerrilla Conference of the FARC EP  In 1982  FARC EP held its Seventh Guerrilla Conference  which called for a major shift in FARC s strategy  FARC had historically been doing most of its fighting in rural areas  and was limited to small scale confrontations with Colombian military forces  By 1982  increased income from the  coca boom  allowed them to expand into an irregular army  which would then stage large scale attacks on Colombian troops  They also began sending fighters to Vietnam and the Soviet Union for advanced military training  They also planned to move closer to middle sized cities  as opposed to only remote rural areas  and closer to areas rich in natural resources  in order to create a strong economic infrastructure  It was also at this conference that FARC added the initials  EP   for  Ejército del Pueblo  or  People s Army   to the organization s name   1 5  La Uribe Agreement and Union Patriótica  In the early 1980s  President Belisario Betancur began discussing the possibility of peace talks with the guerrillas  Ultimately this resulted in the 1984 La Uribe Agreement  which called for a cease fire  which ended up lasting from 1984 to 1987   In 1985  members of the FARC EP  along with a large number of other leftist and communist groups  formed a political party known as the Union Patriótica   Patriotic Union   UP   The UP sought political reforms  known as Apertura Democratica  such as constitutional reform  more democratic local elections  political decentralization  and ending the domination of Colombian politics by the Liberal and Conservative parties  They also pursued socioeconomic reforms such land redistribution  greater health and education spending  the nationalization of foreign businesses  Colombian banks  and transportation  and greater public access to mass media  While many members of the UP were involved with the FARC EP  the large majority of them were not and came from a wide variety of backgrounds such as labor unions and socialist parties such as the PCC  In the cities  the FARC EP began integrating itself with the UP and forming Juntas Patrióticas  or  solidarity cells   – small groups of people associated with labor unions  student activist groups  and peasant leagues  who traveled into the barrios discussing social problems  building support for the UP  and determining the sociopolitical stance of the urban peasantry   The UP performed better in elections than any other leftist party in Colombia s history  In 1986  UP candidates won 350 local council seats  23 deputy positions in departmental assemblies  9 seats in the House  and 6 seats in the Senate  The 1986 Presidential candidate  Jaime Pardo Leal  won 4 6% of the national vote   Since 1986  thousands of members of the UP and other leftist parties were murdered  estimates range from 4 000 to 6 000   In 1987  the President of the UP  Jaime Pardo  was murdered  In 1989 a single large landholder had over 400 UP members murdered  Over 70% of all Colombian presidential candidates in 1990—and 100% of those from center left parties—were assassinated   1 6  1990–1998  During this period  the Colombian government continued its negotiations with the FARC EP and other armed groups  some of which were successful  Some of the groups which demobilized at this time include the EPL  the ERP  the Quintín Lame Armed Movement  and the M 19   Towards the end of 1990  the army  with no advance warning and while negotiations were still ongoing with the group  attacked a compound known as Casa Verde  which housed the National Secretariat of the FARC EP  The Colombian government argued that the attack was caused by the FARC EP s lack of commitment to the process  since the organization was continuing its criminal activities   During this year on 10 August senior leader Jacobo Arenas  an ideological leader and founder of FARC EP  died   On 3 June 1991  dialogue resumed between the Simón Bolívar Guerrilla Coordinating Board and the government on neutral territory in Caracas  Venezuela and Tlaxcala  Mexico  However  the war did not stop  and armed attacks by both sides continued  The negotiation process was broken off in 1993 after no agreement was reached  The Coordinating Board disappeared not long after that time  and guerrilla groups continued their activities independently   Before the break off of dialogue  a letter written by a group of Colombian intellectuals  among whom were Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez  to the Simón Bolívar Guerrilla Coordinating Board was released denouncing the approach taken by the FARC EP and the dire consequences that it was having for the country   In the early 1990s  the FARC EP had between 7 000 and 10 000 fighters  organized into 70 fronts spread throughout the country  From 1996 to 1998 they inflicted a series of strikes on the Colombian Army  including a three day offensive in Mitú  Vaupés department   taking a large number of soldiers prisoner   On 23 September 1994  the FARC kidnapped American agricultural scientist Thomas Hargrove and held him captive for 11 months  After his release  Hargrove wrote a book about his ordeal which inspired the 2000 film Proof of Life starring Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe   Over this period in Colombia  the cultivation of different drugs expanded and there were widespread coca farmers  marches  These marches brought to a halt several major arteries in southern Colombia  Government officials said that FARC EP had forced the protesters to participate  According to social anthropologist María Clemencia Ramírez  the relationship between the guerrillas and the marches was ambivalent  FARC EP promoted the 1996 protests as part of their participatory democracy policies yet also exercised authoritarianism  which led to tensions and negotiations with peasant leaders  but the cocalero movement brought proposals on behalf of the coca growers and defended its own interests   1 7  Andrés Pastrana s presidency  1998–2002   In March 1999 members of a local FARC contingent killed 3 USA based indigenous rights activists  who were working with the U Wa people to build a school for U Wa children  and were fighting against encroachment of U Wa territory by multinational oil corporations  The killings were questioned by many and condemned by many others  and led the United States to increase pressure on the Pastrana administration to crack down on FARC guerrillas   1 7 1  1998–2002 peace process  With the hope of negotiating a peace settlement  on 7 November 1998  President Andrés Pastrana granted FARC EP a safe haven meant to serve as a confidence building measure  centered around the San Vicente del Caguán settlement   After a series of high profile guerrilla actions  including the hijacking of an aircraft  the attack on several small towns and cities  the arrest of the Irish Colombia Three  see below  and the alleged training of FARC EP militants in bomb making by them  and the kidnapping of several political figures  Pastrana ended the peace talks on 21 February 2002 and ordered the armed forces to start retaking the FARC EP controlled zone  beginning at midnight  A 48 hour respite that had been previously agreed to with the rebel group was not respected as the government argued that it had already been granted during an earlier crisis in January  when most of the more prominent FARC EP commanders had apparently left the demilitarized zone  Shortly after the end of talks  the FARC EP kidnapped Oxygen Green Party presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt  who was traveling in Colombian territory  Betancourt was rescued by the Colombian government on 2 July 2008  see Operation Jaque below    1 7 2  The Colombia Three case  On 24 April 2002  the U S  House of Representatives Committee on International Relations published the findings of its investigation into IRA activities in Colombia  Their report alleged a longstanding connection between the IRA and FARC EP  mentioned at least 15 IRA members who had been traveling in and out of Colombia since 1998  and estimated that the IRA had received at least $2 million in drug proceeds for training FARC EP members  The IRA FARC EP connection was first made public on 11 August 2001  following the arrest in Bogotá of two IRA explosives and urban warfare experts and of a representative of Sinn Féin who was known to be stationed in Cuba  Jim Monaghan  Martin McCauley and Niall Connolly  known as the Colombia Three   were arrested in Colombia in August 2001 and were accused of teaching bomb making methods to FARC EP   On 15 February 2002  the Colombia Three were charged with training FARC EP members in bomb making in Colombia  The Colombian authorities had received satellite footage  probably supplied by the CIA  of the men with FARC EP in an isolated jungle area  where they are thought to have spent the last five weeks  They could have spent up to 20 years in jail if the allegations were proved   During October 2001  a key witness in the case against the three Irish republicans disappeared  This came as Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams admitted one of the men was the party s representative in Cuba  The missing witness  a former police inspector  said he had seen Mr McCauley with FARC EP members in 1998  Without his testimony  legal sources said the chances of convicting the three men were reduced   They were eventually found guilty of traveling on false passports in June 2004 but were acquitted of training FARC EP members  That decision was reversed after an appeal by the Attorney General of Colombia and they were sentenced to 17 year terms  However  they vanished in December 2004 while on bail and returned to Ireland  Tánaiste Mary Harney said no deal had been done with Sinn Féin or the IRA over the three s return to Ireland adding that the Irish government would consider any request from the Colombian authorities for their extradition  Colombian vice president Francisco Santos Calderón did not rule out allowing them to serve their sentences in Ireland   1 8  Álvaro Uribe s Presidency  2002–2010   1 8 1  2002–2005 period  For most of the period between 2002 and 2005  the FARC EP was believed to be in a strategic withdrawal due to the increasing military and police actions of new president Álvaro Uribe  which led to the capture or desertion of many fighters and medium level commanders  Uribe ran for office on an anti FARC EP platform and was determined to defeat FARC EP in a bid to create  confidence  in the country  Uribe s own father had been killed by FARC EP in an attempted kidnapping in 1983   In 2002 and 2003  FARC broke up ten large ranches in Meta  an eastern Colombian province  and distributed the land to local subsistence farmers   During the first two years of the Uribe administration  several FARC EP fronts  most notably in Cundinamarca and Antioquia  were broken by the government s military operations   On 5 May 2003  the FARC assassinated the governor of Antioquia  Guillermo Gaviria Correa  his advisor for peace  former defense minister Gilberto Echeverri Mejía  and 8 soldiers  The FARC had kidnapped Mr  Gaviria and Mr  Echeverri a year earlier  when the 2 men were leading a march for peace from Medellín to Caicedo in Antioquia   On 13 July 2004  the office of the United Nations  High Commissioner for Human Rights publicly condemned the group  proving that FARC EP violated article 17 of the additional Protocol II of the Geneva Convention and international humanitarian law  as a result of the 10 July massacre of seven peasants and the subsequent displacement of eighty individuals in San Carlos  Antioquia   In early February 2005  a series of small scale actions by the FARC EP around the southwestern departments of Colombia  resulted in an estimated 40 casualties  The FARC EP  in response to government military operations in the south and in the southeast  would now be displacing its military center of gravity towards the Nariño  Putumayo and Cauca departments   1 8 2  Possibility of prisoner exchange with the government  The FARC EP originally said that they would only release the police and military members they held captive  whom they considered to be prisoners of war  through exchanges with the government for imprisoned FARC EP members  During the duration of the DMZ negotiations  a small humanitarian exchange took place   The group demanded a demilitarized zone including two towns  Florida and Pradera  in the strategic region of Valle del Cauca  where much of the current military action against them has taken place  plus this region is also an important way of transporting drugs to the Pacific coast  This demand was rejected by the Colombian government based on previous experience during the 2002 peace talks   On 2 December 2004  the government announced the pardon of 23 FARC EP prisoners  to encourage a reciprocal move  The prisoners to be released were all of low rank and had promised not to rejoin the armed struggle  In November 2004  the FARC EP had rejected a proposal to hand over 59 of its captives in exchange for 50 guerrillas imprisoned by the government   In a communique dated 28 November but released publicly on 3 December  the FARC EP declared that they were no longer insisting on the demilitarization of San Vicente del Caguán and Cartagena del Chairá as a precondition for the negotiation of the prisoner exchange  but instead that of Florida and Pradera in the Valle department  They state that this area would lie outside the  area of influence  of both their Southern and Eastern Blocks  the FARC EP s strongest  and that of the military operations being carried out by the Uribe administration   They requested security guarantees both for the displacement of their negotiators and that of the guerrillas that would be freed  which are specifically stated to number as many as 500 or more  and ask the Catholic Church to coordinate the participation of the United Nations and other countries in the process   The FARC EP also mention in the communique that Simón Trinidad s extradition  would be a serious obstacle to reaching a prisoner exchange agreement with the government  On 17 December 2004  the Colombian government authorized Trinidad s extradition to the United States  but stated that the measure could be revoked if the FARC EP released all political hostages and military captives in its possession before 30 December  The FARC EP rejected the demand   1 8 3  Partial captive releases and escapes during 2006 and 2007  On 25 March 2006  after a public announcement made weeks earlier  the FARC EP released two captured policemen at La Dorada  Putumayo  The release took place some southwest of Bogotá  near the Ecuadorean border  The Red Cross said the two were released in good health  Military operations in the area and bad weather had prevented the release from occurring one week earlier   In a separate series of events  civilian hostage and German citizen Lothar Hintze was released by FARC EP on 4 April 2006  after five years in captivity  Hintze had been kidnapped for extortion purposes  and his wife had paid three ransom payments without any result   One prisoner  Julian Ernesto Guevara Castro  a police officer  died of tuberculosis on 28 January 2006  He was a captain and was captured on 1 November 1998  On 29 March 2009  the FARC EP announced that they would give Guevara s remains to his mother  The FARC handed over Guevara s remains on 1 April 2010   Another civilian hostage  Fernando Araújo  later named Minister of Foreign Relations and formerly Development Minister  escaped his captors on 31 December 2006  Araújo had to walk through the jungle for five days before being found by troops in the hamlet of San Agustin  north of Bogotá  He was kidnapped on 5 December 2000 while jogging in the Caribbean coastal city of Cartagena  He was reunited with his family on 5 January 2007   Another prisoner  Jhon Frank Pinchao  a police officer  escaped his captors on 28 April 2007 after nine years in captivity  He was reunited with his family on 15 May 2007   1 8 4  2007 death of 11 hostage deputies  On 28 June 2007  the FARC EP reported the death of 11 out of 12 provincial deputies from the Valle del Cauca Department whom the guerrillas had kidnapped in 2002  The guerrillas claimed that the deputies had been killed by crossfire during an attack by an  unidentified military group   The Colombian government stated that government forces had not made any rescue attempts and that the FARC EP executed the hostages  FARC did not report any other casualties on either side and delayed months before permitting the Red Cross to recover the remains  According to the government  the guerrillas delayed turning over the corpses to let decomposition hide evidence of how they died  The Red Cross reported that the corpses had been washed and their clothing changed before burial  hiding evidence of how they were killed  The Red Cross also reported that the deputies had been killed by multiple close range shots  many of them in the back of the victims  and even two by shots to the head   In February 2009  Sigifredo López  the only deputy who survived and was later released by FARC  accused the group of killing the 11 captives and denied that any military rescue attempt had taken place  According to López  the unexpected arrival of another guerrilla unit resulted in confusion and paranoia  leading the rebels to kill the rest of the Valle deputies  He survived after previously being punished for insubordination and was held in chains nearby but separated from the rest of the group   1 8 5  Major developments during 2008  1 8 5 1  Clara Rojas and Consuelo González liberation  On 10 January 2008  former vice presidential candidate Clara Rojas and former congresswoman Consuelo González were freed after nearly six years in captivity  In a Venezuela brokered deal  a helicopter flew deep into Colombia to pick up both hostages  The women were escorted out of the jungle by armed guerrillas to a clearing where they were picked up by Venezuelan helicopters that bore International Red Cross insignias  In a statement published on a pro rebel Web site  the FARC EP said the unilateral release demonstrated the group s willingness to engage the Colombian government in talks over the release of as many as 800 people who are still being held  In a televised speech  Colombia s U S  allied president  Álvaro Uribe  thanked Chavez for his efforts   During the period she was held kidnapped in the jungle in 2004  Clara Rojas gave birth to her son by Caesarean  At 8 months old  the baby was removed from the area and Rojas didn t hear of the boy again until 31 December  when she heard Colombian President Álvaro Uribe say on the radio that the child was no longer with her captors  DNA tests later confirmed the boy  who had been living in a Bogotá foster home for more than two years under a different name  was hers  She reclaimed her son  Asked about her opinion of the FARC EP as group  Rojas called it  a criminal organization   condemning its kidnappings as  a total violation of human dignity  and saying some captive police and soldiers are constantly chained   1 8 5 2  February 2008 liberations  On 31 January 2008  the FARC EP announced that they would release civilian hostages Luis Eladio Perez Bonilla  Gloria Polanco  and Orlando Beltran Cuellar to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez as a humanitarian gesture  On 27 February 2008  the three hostages and Jorge Eduardo Gechem Turbay  who was added to the list due to his poor health  were released by FARC EP  With the authorization of the Colombian government and the participation of the International Red Cross  a Venezuelan helicopter transported them to Caracas from San Jose del Guaviare  The FARC EP had called its planned release of the hostages a gesture of recognition for the mediation efforts of Chávez  who had called on the international community to recognize the rebels as belligerents a month prior  Colombian President Álvaro Uribe  who had tense relations with Chavez  thanked the socialist leader and called for the release of all hostages  He said Colombia was still in a fight  against terrorist actions  but was open to reconciliation   1 8 5 3  Anti FARC rallies  On 4 February 2008  several rallies were held in Colombia and in other locations around the world  criticizing FARC EP and demanding the liberation of hundreds of hostages  The protests were originally organized through the popular social networking site Facebook and were also supported by local Colombian media outlets as well as the Colombian government  Participation estimates vary from the hundreds of thousands to several millions of people in Colombia and thousands worldwide   Kiraz Janicke of leftist  Venezuela News  Views and Analysis  website criticized the rallies  claiming that  right wing paramilitary leaders featured prominently  in their organization and arguing that workers were also pressured to attend the gatherings  According to her  the purpose of the protests was to promote  Uribe s policy of perpetuating Colombia s decades long civil war   Shortly before the rallies took place thirteen demobilized AUC paramilitary leaders  including Salvatore Mancuso  had expressed their support of the protest through a communique  However  this move was rejected by organizer Carlos Andrés Santiago  who stated that such an endorsement was harmful and criticized the AUC s actions   On 20 July 2008  a subsequent set of rallies against FARC included thousands of Colombians in Bogotá and hundreds of thousands throughout the rest of the country   1 8 5 4  Death of Raúl Reyes  On 1 March 2008  the Colombian military attacked a FARC EP camp inside Ecuador s territory as part of a targeted killing directed at Raúl Reyes  The attack killed over 20 people  about 17 of whom were members of the FARC EP  Reyes  found among the dead along with at least 16 of his fellow guerrillas  was known as FARC EP s international spokesman and hostage release negotiator  He was considered to be FARC EP s second in command   This incident led to a breakdown in diplomatic relations between Ecuador and Colombia  and between Venezuela and Colombia  Ecuador condemned the attack   It has been considered the biggest blow against FARC EP in its more than four decades of existence  This event was quickly followed by the death of Ivan Rios  another member of FARC EP s seven man Secretariat  less than a week later  by the hand of his own bodyguard  It came as a result of heavy Colombian military pressure and a reward offer of up to $5 million from the Colombian government   1 8 5 5  Death of Manuel Marulanda Vélez  Manuel Marulanda Vélez died on 26 March 2008 after a heart attack  His death would be kept a secret  until Colombian magazine  Revista Semana  published an interview with Colombian defense minister Juan Manuel Santos on 24 May 2008 in which Santos mentions the death of Manuel Marulanda Vélez  The news was confirmed by FARC EP commander  Timochenko  on pan Latin American television station teleSUR on 25 May 2008   Timochenko  announced the new commander in chief is  Alfonso Cano  After speculations in several national and international media about the  softening up  of the FARC and the announcement of Colombian President Álvaro Uribe that several FARC leaders were ready to surrender and free their captives  the secretariat of the FARC sent out a communiqué emphasizing the death of their founder would not change their approach towards the captives or the humanitarian agreement   1 8 5 6  Hugo Chávez s call to disarm  On 11 January 2008 during the annual State of the Nation in the Venezuelan National Assembly  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez referred to the FARC as  a real army that occupies territory in Colombia  they re not terrorists       They have a political goal and we have to recognize that    However  on 13 January 2008  Chavez retracted his previous statement and stated his disapproval of the FARC EP strategy of armed struggle and kidnapping  saying  I don t agree with kidnapping and I don t agree with armed struggle   President Hugo Chávez has repeatedly expressed his disapproval of the practice of kidnapping stating on 14 April that   If I were a guerrilla  I wouldn t have the need to hold a woman  a man who aren t soldiers   Free the civilians who don t have anything to do with the war  I don t agree with that    On 7 March at the Cumbre de Rio  Chavez stated again that the FARC EP should lay down their arms  Look at what has happened and is happening in Latin America  reflect on this  FARC EP   we are done with war    enough with all this death   On 8 June Chavez repeated his call for a political solution and an end to the war   The guerrilla war is history   At this moment in Latin America  an armed guerrilla movement is out of place    1 8 5 7  Operation Jaque  On 2 July 2008  under a Colombian military operation called Operation Jaque  the FARC EP was tricked by the Colombian Government into releasing 15 captives to Colombian Intelligence agents disguised as journalists and international aid workers in a helicopter rescue  Military intelligence agents infiltrated the guerrilla ranks and led the local commander in charge of the captives  Gerardo Aguilar Ramírez  alias Cesar  to believe they were going to take them by helicopter to Alfonso Cano  the guerrillas  supreme leader  The rescued included Íngrid Betancourt  former presidential Candidate   U S  military contractors Marc Gonsalves  Thomas Howes  and Keith Stansell  as well as eleven Colombian police officers and soldiers  The commander  Cesar and one other rebel were taken into custody by agents without incident after boarding the helicopter  On 4 July  some observers questioned whether or not this was an intercepted captive release made to look like a rescue   In a 5 July communique  FARC itself blamed rebels Cesar and Enrique for the escape of the captives and acknowledged the event as a setback but reiterated their willingness to reach future humanitarian agreements   Immediately after the captive rescue  Colombian military forces cornered the rest of FARC EP s 1st Front  the unit which had held the captives  Colombian forces did not wish to attack the 1st Front but instead offered them amnesty if they surrender   Colombia s Program for Humanitarian Attention for the Demobilized announced in August 2008 that 339 members of Colombia s rebel groups surrendered and handed in their weapons in July  including 282 guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia   1 8 5 8  Óscar Tulio Lizcano Freed  Lizcano  a Colombian Conservative Party congressman  was kidnapped 5 August 2000  On Sunday  26 October 2008  the ex congressman  Óscar Tulio Lizcano escaped from FARC EP rebels  Tulio Lizcano was a hostage for over 8 years  and escaped with a FARC EP rebel he convinced to travel with him  They evaded pursuit for three days as they trekked through mountains and jungles  encountering the military in the western coastal region of Colombia  Tulio Lizcano is the first hostage to escape since the successful military rescue of Ingrid Betancourt  and the longest held political hostage by the organization  He became the 22nd Colombian political hostage to gain freedom during 2008   During his final days in captivity  Lizcano told Santos  they had nothing to eat but wild palm hearts and sugar cane  With the military tightening the noose  a FARC EP rebel turned himself in and provided Colombian authorities with Lizcano s exact location in the northwest state of Choco  As police and army troops prepared to launch a rescue operation  Lizcano escaped alongside one of his guerrilla guards who had decided to desert  The two men hiked through the rain forest for three days and nights until they encountered an army patrol  Speaking from a clinic in the western city of Cali  Mr Lizcano said that when soldiers saw him screaming from across a jungle river  they thought he was drunk and ignored him  Only when he lifted the FARC EP rebel s Galil assault rifle did the soldiers begin to understand that he was escaping from the FARC EP rebels   They jumped into the river  and then I started to shout   I m Lizcano    he said   1 8 5 9  Other late 2008 developments  Soon after the liberation of this prominent political hostage  the Vice President of Colombia Francisco Santos Calderón called Latin America s biggest guerrilla group a  paper tiger  with little control of the nation s territory  adding that  they have really been diminished to the point where we can say they are a minimal threat to Colombian security   and that  After six years of going after them  reducing their income and promoting reinsertion of most of their members  they look like a paper tiger   However  he warned against any kind of premature triumphalism  because  crushing the rebels will take time   The of jungle in Colombia makes it hard to track them down to fight   1 8 6  February 2009 liberations  On 21 December 2008  The FARC EP announced that they would release civilian hostages Alan Jara  Sigifredo López  three low ranking police officers and a low ranking soldier to Senator Piedad Córdoba as a humanitarian gesture  On 1 February 2009  the FARC EP proceeded with the release of the four security force members  Juan Fernando Galicio Uribe  José Walter Lozano Guarnizo  Alexis Torres Zapata and William Giovanni Domínguez Castro  All of them were captured in 2007  Jara  kidnapped in 2001  was released on 3 February and López  kidnapped in 2002  was released on 5 February   1 8 7  Release of Swedish hostage  On 17 March 2009  The FARC EP released Swedish hostage Erik Roland Larsson  Larsson  paralyzed in half his body  was handed over to detectives in a rugged region of the northern state of Córdoba  Larsson was kidnapped from his ranch in Tierralta  not far from where he was freed  on 16 May 2007  along with his Colombian girlfriend  Diana Patricia Pena while paying workers  She escaped that same month following a gun battle between her captors and police  Larsson suffered a stroke while in captivity  The FARC EP had sought a $5 million ransom  One of Larsson s sons said that the ransom was not paid   1 8 8  December 2009 hostage killing  On 22 December 2009  the body of Luis Francisco Cuéllar  the Governor of Caquetá  was discovered  a day after he had been kidnapped from his house in Florencia  Caquetá  Officials said the abduction and execution had been carried by the FARC  According to officials  he had been killed soon after the abduction  The kidnappers cut the governor s throat as they evaded security forces  In a statement broadcast on radio  the acting governor  Patricia Vega  said   I no longer have any doubts that FARC has done it again   The FARC claimed responsibility for Cuéllar s kidnapping and murder in January 2010  The group said that they kidnapped him in order to  put him on trial for corruption  and blamed his death on an attempt to rescue him by force   1 8 9  March 2010 liberations  On 16 April 2009  The FARC EP announced that they would release Army Corporal Pablo Emilio Moncayo Cabrera to Piedad Córdoba as a humanitarian gesture  Moncayo was captured on 21 December 1997  On 28 June 2009  the FARC announced that they would release Professional Soldier Josue Daniel Calvo Sanchez  Calvo was captured on 20 April 2009  Calvo was released on 28 March 2010  Moncayo was released on 30 March 2010   1 8 10  Operation Chameleon  On 13 June 2010  Colombian troops rescued Police Colonel Luis Herlindo Mendieta Ovalle  Police Captain Enrique Murillo Sanchez and Army Sergeant Arbey Delgado Argote  after twelve years as prisoners  Argote was captured on 3 August 1998  Ovalle and Sanchez were captured on 1 November 1998  On 14 June  Police Lieutenant William Donato Gomez was also rescued  He was also captured on 3 August 1998   1 9  Juan Manuel Santos s presidency  President Juan Manuel Santos began his term with a suspected FARC bomb blast in Bogotá  This followed the resolution of the 2010 Colombia–Venezuela diplomatic crisis which erupted over outgoing President Álvaro Uribe s allegations of active Venezuelan support for FARC   In early September 2010  FARC EP attacks in the Nariño Department and Putumayo Department in southern Colombia killed some fifty policemen and soldiers in hit and run assaults   According to a December report by the Corporación Nuevo Arco Iris NGO  473 FARC EP guerrillas and 357 members of the Colombian security forces died in combat between January and September 2010  An additional 1 382 government soldiers or policemen were wounded during the same period  with the report estimating that the total number of casualties could reach 2 500 by the end of the year  Nuevo Arco Iris head León Valencia considered that FARC guerrillas have reacted to a series of successful military blows against them by splitting up their forces into smaller groups and intensifying the offensive use of anti personnel land mines  leading to what he called a further  degradation  of the conflict  Valencia also added that both coca crops and the drug trade have  doubled  in areas with FARC EP presence  Researcher Claudia López considered that the Colombian government is winning the strategic and aerial side of the war but not the infantry front  where both the FARC EP and ELN continue to maintain an offensive capacity   Military offensives carried out under former President Alvaro Uribe and President Juan Manuel Santos have been able to reduce the number of FARC combattants to 7 000  which is much lower than the 20 000 combattants FARC employed in the early 2000s  This military offensive has also been able to reduce FARC territorial control and push guerillas to more remote and sparsely populated regions  often close to territorial or internal borders   1 9 1  2010 death of Mono Jojoy  Colombian authorities announced the death of Víctor Julio Suárez Rojas  also known as Mono Jojoy  on 23 September 2010  President Juan Manuel Santos stated that the FARC commander was killed in an operation that began in the early hours of 21 September in the department of Meta  south of the capital Bogotá  According to Santos  he was  the impersonation of terror and a symbol of violence   After this event  the FARC EP released a statement saying that defeating the group would not bring peace to Colombia and called for a negotiated solution  not surrender  to the social and political conflict   1 9 2  January through October 2011  In January 2011 Juan Manuel Santos admitted that FARC EP had killed 460 government soldiers and wounded over 2 000 in 2010  In April 2011 the Colombian congress issued a statement saying that FARC has a  strong presence  in roughly one third of the municipalities in Colombia  while their attacks have increased  Overall FARC operations  including attacks against security forces as well as kidnappings and the use of land mines  have increased every year since 2005  In the first 6 months of 2011 the FARC carried out an estimated 1 115 actions  which constitutes a 10% increase over the same period in 2010   By early 2011 Colombian authorities and news media reported that the FARC and the clandestine sister groups have partly shifted strategy from guerrilla warfare to  a war of militias   meaning that they are increasingly operating in civilian clothes while hiding amongst sympathizers in the civilian population  In early January 2011 the Colombian army said that the FARC has some 18 000 members  with 9 000 of those forming part of the militias  The army says it has  identified  at least 1 400 such militia members in the FARC strongholds of Valle del Cauca and Cauca in 2011  In June 2011 Colombian chief of staff Edgar Cely claimed that the FARC wants to  urbanize their actions   which could partly explain the increased guerrilla activity in Medellín and particularly Cali  Jeremy McDermott  co director of Insight Crime  estimates that FARC may have some 30 000  part time fighters  in 2011  consisting of both armed and unarmed civilian supporters making up the rebel militia network  instead of full time fighters wearing uniforms   According to Corporación Nuevo Arco Iris  FARC EP killed 429 members of the Colombian government s security forces between January and October 2011  During this same period  the rebel group lost 316 of its own members  The year 2011 saw over 2 000 incidents of FARC activity  which was the highest figure recorded since 1998  The NGO has stated that while most of these incidents remain defensive in nature and are not like the large offensives from years past  FARC actions have been growing since 2005  and the rebel group is currently carrying out intense operations against small and medium sized Colombian military units in vulnerable areas   1 9 2 1  Death of Alfonso Cano  Colombian troops killed FARC leader Alfonso Cano in a firefight on 4 November 2011  The 6th Front of the FARC  which was in charge of Cano s security at the time of his death  retaliated by killing two policemen in Suarez and Jambaló some 24 hours after the death of Cano   1 9 2 2  Death of captives in Operation Jupiter  On 26 November 2011  the FARC killed Police Captain Edgar Yesid Duarte Valero  Police Lieutenant Elkin Hernandez Rivas  Army Corporal Libio Jose Martinez Estrada and Police Intendant Alvaro Moreno after government troops approached the guerrilla camp where they were held  Police Sergeant Luis Alberto Erazo Maya managed to escape his captors and was later rescued   The Colombian military had information indicating that there could be captives in the area and initiated Operation Jupiter in October 2011  using a 56 men Special Forces unit to carry out surveillance for preparing a future rescue mission that would involve additional troops and air support  According to the Colombian military  this same unit remained in the area for 43 days and did not find the captives until they accidentally ran into the FARC camp on the way back  which led to a shootout  Relatives of the captives  former victims and civil society groups blamed both the government and FARC for the outcome  questioning the operation as well as criticizing military rescues   1 9 2 3  2012 release of last political hostages  On 26 February 2012  the FARC announced that they would release their remaining ten political hostages  The hostages were released on 2 April 2012  The president of Colombia  Juan Manuel Santos  said that this incident was  not enough   and asked the FARC to release the civilian hostages they possess   1 9 2 4  Release of Chinese hostages  On 22 November 2012  the FARC released four Chinese oil workers  The hostages were working for the Emerald Energy oil company  a British based subsidiary of China s Sinochem Group  when they were kidnapped on 8 June 2011  Their Colombian driver was also kidnapped  but released several hours later  Authorities identified the freed men as Tang Guofu  Zhao Hongwei  Jian Mingfu  and Jiang Shan   1 9 3  Peace talks  Santos announced on 27 August 2012 that the Colombian government has engaged in exploratory talks with FARC in order to seek an end to the conflict   Exploratory conversations have been held with the FARC to find an end to the conflict  I want to make very clear to Colombians that the approaches that have been carried out and the ones that will happen in the future will be carried out within the framework based on these principles  We are going to learn from the mistakes made in the past so that they are not repeated  Second  any process must lead to the end of the conflict  not making it longer  Third  operations and military presence will be maintained across the entire national territory He also said that he would learn from the mistakes of previous leaders  who failed to secure a lasting ceasefire with FARC  though the military would still continue operations throughout Colombia while talks continued  An unnamed Colombian intelligence source said Santos has assured FARC that no one would be extradited to stand trial in another country  Al Jazeera reported that the initiative began after Santos met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and asked him to mediate  Former President Uribe has criticized Santos for seeking peace  at any cost  and rejected the idea of holding talks  Telesur reported that FARC and the Colombian government had signed a preliminary agreement in Havana the same day  The first round of the talks will take place in Oslo on 5 October and then return to Havana for approximately six months of talks before culminating in Colombia  However  Santos later ruled out a ceasefire pending the talks in Oslo and reiterated that offensive operations against FARC would continue   ELN leader Nicolas Rodriguez Bautista  otherwise known as Gabino  added that his group was interested in joining the talks too   Well we are open  it s exactly our proposal  to seek room for open dialogue without conditions and start to discuss the nation s biggest problems  But the government has said no  Santos says he has the keys to peace in his pocket  but I think he has lost them because there seems to be no possibility of a serious dialogue  we remain holding out for that    Colombia s RCN Radio reported on 29 September that a preliminary draft of the proposals indicated that a resolution would involve answering FARC s historic grievances including rural development and agrarian reform  democracy development via an enhancement of the number of registered political parties  security and compensation for the victims of the conflict  In this regards  the Colombian government has alread passed a series of laws that entail compensation for the victims and a return of land to the displaced  FARC also indicated a willingness to give up their arms  Former M19 member Antonio Navarro Wolff said   If the government wants a serious peace plan they will have to take control of the coca leaf plantations that are currently owned by the FARC because if not another criminal group will take over it   Santos later told Al Jazeera that peace was possible if there was  goodwill  on both sides  Santos told the General debate of the sixty seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly on 26 September  that Venezuela and Chile were also helping in the discussion along with Cuba and Norway   Peace talks were formally started on 18 October in a hotel 30 miles north of the Norwegian capital Oslo with a joint press conference by both delegations  The representatives of the government  led by Humberto de la Calle and the FARC  led by Iván Márquez  said the so called second phase of the peace process will be inaugurated in Oslo on 15 November  after which the delegations will go to Cuba to work on the negotiation of the peace accord  which will ultimately lead to a permanent agreement and ceasefire  The Colombian government has also stated that they expect that a post Chavez government will continue to support the peace process  In late 2012  FARC declared a two month unilateral cease fire and said that they would be open to extending it as a bilateral truce afterwards during the rest of the negotiations  The Colombian government refused to agree to a bilateral cease fire  alleging violations of the truce by FARC   Shortly after lifting the ceasefire  FARC conducted attacks on a coal transport railway  which derailed 17 wagons and forced a suspension of operations and assaulted Milan  a town in the southern Caquetá  killing at least seven government soldiers and injuring five others   Santos has been far more responsive to threats against social leaders than his predecessors  He has also been decisive in combatting the New Illegal Armed Groups that emerged as a result of the paramilitary process  especially in fighting threats and violence against human rights defenders and social leaders  During Santos  presidency  private security and proclaimed self defense movements have also lost their legitimacy   On 27 May 2013  it was announced that one of the most contentious issues had been resolved  Land reform and compensation was tackled with promises to compensate those who had lost land  This is the first time the government and FARC have reached an agreement on a substantive issue in four different negotiating attempts over 30 years  The peace process then moved on to the issue of  political participation   during which FARC insisted on its demand for an elected Constituent Assembly to rewrite Colombia s constitution  This demand has been forcefully rejected by Colombia s lead government negotiator  Humberto de la Calle   On 1 July 2013  FARC and the second largest guerrilla group in Colombia  ELN  announced that they would be working together to find a  political solution to the social and armed conflict   The details of this partnership  however  are far from clear  Washington Office on Latin America s Adam Isacson explains that two issues central to peace accords with ELN—resource policy and kidnapping—are currently off the table in the talks in Havana with FARC  and the addition of these topics may complicate and slow down an already sluggish process   On 6 November 2013 the Colombian government and FARC announced that they had come to an agreement regarding the participation of political opposition and would begin discussing their next issue  the illicit drug trade   On 23 January 2014 Juan Fernando Cristo  the President of the Senate of Colombia  proposed a second Plan Colombia during a conference on the Colombian peace process in Washington  D C  Cristo stated that this new plan should be  for the victims  and should redirect the resources from the original Plan Colombia towards supporting a post conflict Colombia   On May 16  2014  the Colombian government and the FARC rebels agreed to work together against drug trafficking  added to the development of these peace talks   2  Financing and governance  FARC receives most of its funding—which has been estimated to average some $300 million per year—from taxation of the illegal drug trade and other activities  ransom kidnappings  bank robberies  and extortion of large landholders  multinational corporations  and agribusiness  From taxation of illegal drugs and other economic activity FARC has been estimated to receive approximately 60 to 100 million dollars per year  These funds are partly used to fund military operations and partly to keep the peace between peasants and traffickers  forcing the later to pay a livable wage  keeping crime at bay and sustaining social services where the government is absent  2 1  Role of FARC in the areas it controls  FARCs history is deeply rooted in its historical workers struggle for which its more peaceful members were persecuted and killed en massé during the period of La Violencia  It has continued to employ this ideology in the now mostly peasant dominated areas that it controls  attempting to follow the principles of FOCO  In acting as a vanguard it has often times forcefully instituted its rule of law in the areas that it controls as to bring an end to corruption and crime  In its struggle to provide social services it has succeeded delivering health care and education  and infrastructure in the form of roads and electricity  The people of these areas have become accustomed to accepting them as the local authority   2 2  Means of financing  The guerillas main means of financing is through the drug trade which includes both direct and indirect participation  taxation  administration or control of areas of production and trafficking  A large but often difficult to estimate portion of funding comes from the taxation of businesses and even local farmers  oftentimes lumped in or defined by its opponents as extortion  It is important to note that in areas in which this happens there rarely tends to be any government taxation or services and thus the absence of such provided by FARC would leave the population without any   2 2 1  Drug trade  FARC EP was not initially involved in direct drug cultivation  trafficking  or trans shipment prior to or during the 1980s  Instead  it maintained a system of taxation on the production that took place in the territories that they controlled  in exchange for protecting the growers and establishing law and order in these regions by implementing its own rules and regulations  During the 1990s  FARC expanded its operations  in some areas  to include trafficking and production  which has provided a significant portion of its funding  Right wing paramilitary groups also receive a large portion of their income from drug trafficking and production operations   A 1992 Central Intelligence Agency report  acknowledged that the FARC had become increasingly involved in drugs through their  taxing  of the trade in areas under their geographical control and that in some cases the insurgents protected trafficking infrastructure to further fund their insurgency   but also described the relationship between the FARC and the drug traffickers as one  characterized by both cooperation and friction  and concluded that  we do not believe that the drug industry  in Colombia  would be substantially disrupted in the short term by attacks against guerrillas  Indeed  many traffickers would probably welcome  and even assist  increased operations against insurgents    In 1994  the DEA came to three similar conclusions  First  that any connections between drug trafficking organizations and Colombian insurgents were  ad hoc  alliances of convenience    Second  that  the independent involvement of insurgents in Colombia s domestic drug productions  transportation  and distribution is limited     there is no evidence that the national leadership of either the FARC or the ELN has directed  as a matter of policy  that their respective organizations directly engage in independent illicit drug production  transportation  or distribution   Third  the report determined that the DEA  has no evidence that the FARC or ELN have been involved in the transportation  distribution  or marketing of illegal drugs in the United States  Furthermore it is doubtful that either insurgent group could develop the international transportation and logistics infrastructure necessary to establish independent drug distribution in the United States or Europe… DEA believes that the insurgents never will be major players in Colombia s drug trade    FARC has called for crop substitution programs that would allow coca farmers to find alternative means of income and subsistence  In 1999  FARC worked with a United Nations alternative development project to enable the transition from coca production to sustainable food production  On its own  the group has also implemented agrarian reform programs in Putumayo   In those FARC EP controlled territories that do produce coca  it is generally grown by peasants on small plots  in paramilitary or government controlled areas  coca is generally grown on large plantations  The FARC EP generally makes sure that peasant coca growers receive a much larger share of profits than the paramilitaries would give them  and demands that traffickers pay a decent wage to their workers  When growers in a FARC controlled area are caught selling coca to non FARC brokers  they are generally forced to leave the region  but when growers are caught selling to FARC in paramilitary controlled areas  they are generally killed  Lower prices paid for raw coca in paramilitary controlled areas lead to significantly larger profits for the drug processing and trafficking organizations  which means that they generally prefer that paramilitaries control an area rather than FARC   In 2000  FARC Spokesman Simon Trinidad said that taxes on drug laboratories represented an important part of the organization s income  although he didn t say how much it was  He defended this funding source  arguing that drug trade was endemic in Colombia because it had pervaded many sectors of its economy   After the 21 April 2001 capture of Brazilian drug lord Luiz Fernando da Costa  aka Fernandinho Beira Mar  in Colombia  Colombian and Brazilian authorities accused him of cooperating with FARC EP through the exchange of weapons for cocaine  They also claimed that he received armed protection from the guerrilla group   In Monday  18 March 2002 the Attorney General of the United States John Ashcroft indicted leaders of the FARC after an 18 month investigation into their narcotics trafficking  Tomas Molina Caracas  the commander of the FARC s 16th Front  led the 16th Front s drug trafficking activities together with Carlos Bolas and a rebel known as Oscar El Negro  Between 1994 and 2001  Molina and other 16th Front members controlled Barranco Minas  where they collected cocaine from other FARC fronts to sell it to international drug traffickers for payment in currency  weapons and equipment   On 22 March 2006 the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced the indictment of fifty leaders of FARC for exporting more than $25 billion worth of cocaine to the United States and other countries  Several of the FARC leaders appeared on the Justice Department s Consolidated Priority Organization target list  which identifies the most dangerous international drug trafficking organizations  Recognizing the increased profits  the FARC moved to become directly involved in the manufacture and distribution of cocaine by setting the price paid for cocaine paste and transporting it to jungle laboratories under FARC control  The charged FARC leaders ordered that Colombian farmers who sold paste to non FARC buyers would be murdered and that U S  fumigation planes should be shot down   On 11 October 2012 Jamal Yousef  aka  Talal Hassan Ghantou   a native of Lebanon  was sentenced to 12 years in prison for conspiring to provide military grade weapons to the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia  the FARC   in exchange for over a ton of cocaine  Yousef pled guilty in May 2012 to one count of providing material support to the FARC   2 2 2  Kidnappings  The FARC EP has carried out both ransom and politically motivated kidnappings in Colombia and has been responsible for the majority of such kidnappings carried out in the country   The guerrillas initially targeted the families of drug traffickers  the wealthy upper class and foreigners but the group later expanded its kidnapping and extortion operations to include the middle class   During the 1984 peace negotiations  FARC pledged to stop kidnapping and condemned the practice  However  hostage taking by FARC increased in the years following this declaration  In a 1997 interview  FARC EP Commander Alfonso Cano argued that some guerrilla units continued to do so for  political and economic reasons  in spite of the prohibition issued by the leadership   In 2000  the FARC EP issued a directive called  Law 002  which demanded a  tax  from all individuals and corporations with assets worth at least $1 million USD  warning that those who failed to pay would be detained by the group  In 2001  FARC Commander Simón Trinidad claimed that the FARC EP does not engage in kidnapping but instead  retains  individuals  in order to obtain resources needed for our struggle   Commander Trinidad said he did not know how many people had been taken by FARC or how much money was collected by the organization in exchange for their freedom  In addition  FARC spokesperson Joaquín Gómez stated that the payment demanded was a tax which many people paid  voluntarily   with kidnapping undertaken because  those who have the resources must pay their share    In 2002  Amnesty International sent a letter to FARC EP Commander Manuel Marulanda condemning kidnapping and hostage taking as well as rejecting the threats directed at municipal or judicial officials and their families  arguing that they are civilians who are protected by international humanitarian law as long as they do not participate in hostilities   According to Amnesty International  the number of kidnappings has decreased in recent years but the human rights organization estimates that FARC and ELN guerrillas continue to be behind hundreds of cases  In 2008  press reports estimated that about 700 hostages continued to be held captive by FARC  According to the Fundación País Libre anti kidnapping NGO  an estimated total of 6 778 people were kidnapped by FARC between 1997 and 2007  In 2009  the state s anti kidnapping agency Fondelibertad reviewed 3 307 officially unsettled cases and removed those that had already been resolved or for which there was insufficient information  The agency concluded that 125 hostages remained in captivity nationwide of whom 66 were being held by the FARC EP  The government s revised figures were considered  absurdly low  by Fundación País Libre  which has argued that its own archives suggest an estimated 1 617 people taken hostage between 2000 and 2008 remain in the hands of their captors  including hundreds seized by FARC  FARC claimed at the time that it was holding nine people for ransom in addition to hostages kept for a prisoner exchange   In 2008  Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez expressed his disagreement with FARC EP s resorting to kidnappings  Former President Fidel Castro of Cuba also criticized the use of hostage taking by the guerrillas as  objectively cruel  and suggested that the group free all of its prisoners and hostages   In February 2012  FARC announced that it would release ten members of the security forces  who it described as political prisoners  representing the last such captives in its custody  It further announced the repeal of Law 002  bringing to an end its support for the practice of kidnapping for ransom  However  it was not clear from the FARC statement what would happen to the civilians it still held in captivity  Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos used Twitter to welcome the move as a  necessary  if insufficient  step in the right direction    3  Human rights concerns  FARC has been accused of committing violations of human rights by numerous groups  including Human Rights Watch  Amnesty International  the United Nations as well as by the Colombian  U S  and European Union governments   A February 2005 report from the United Nations  High Commissioner for Human Rights mentioned that  during 2004   FARC EP continued to commit grave breaches  of human rights  such as murders of protected persons  torture and hostage taking  which affected many civilians  including men  women  returnees  boys and girls  and ethnic groups    3 1  Child soldiers  FARC EP  the ELN and right wing paramilitaries all train teens as soldiers and informants  Human Rights Watch estimates that the FARC EP has the majority of child combatants in Colombia  and that approximately one quarter of its guerrillas are under 18  Forcible recruitment of children  by either side  is rare in Colombia  They join for a variety of reasons including poverty  lack of educational opportunities  avoiding dangerous work in coca processing  escaping from domestic violence  offers of money  mostly from paramilitaries  who pay their soldiers   Human Rights Watch has noted that  once integrated into the FARC EP  children are typically barred from leaving    FARC EP Commander Simón Trinidad has stated that FARC does not allow the enlistment of people under 15 years of age  arguing that this is in accordance with Article 38 of the United Nations  Convention on the Rights of the Child  He has argued that the alternatives for many children in Colombia are worse  including prostitution and exploitative work in mines and coca production  Amnesty International has rejected the validity of such a position in international law   In June 2000  FARC EP Commander Carlos Antonio Lozada told Human Rights Watch that the minimum recruitment age of fifteen years was set in 1996 but admitted that  this norm was not enforced  until recently  Lozada said  however  that it had become an obligatory standard after Commander Jorge Briceño s statements on the matter in April 2000  A 2001 Human Rights Watch report considered FARC EP s refusal to admit children under fifteen years old into their forces to be  encouraging  but added that there is  little evidence that this rule is being strictly applied  and called on the group to demobilize all existing child soldiers and cease this practice in the future   In 2003  Human Rights Watch reported that FARC EP shows no leniency to children because of their age  assigning minors the same duties as adults and sometimes requiring them to participate in executions or witness torture   3 2  Extrajudicial executions  FARC has consistently carried out attacks against civilians specifically targeting suspected supporters of paramilitary groups  political adversaries  journalists  local leaders  and members of certain indigenous groups since at least as early as 1994  From 1994 to 1997 the region of Urabá in Antioquia department was the site of FARC attacks against civilians  FARC has also executed civilians for failing to pay  war taxes  to their group   In 2001  Human Rights Watch  HRW  denounced that the FARC EP had abducted and executed civilians accused of supporting paramilitary groups in the demilitarized zone and elsewhere  without providing any legal defense mechanisms to the suspects and generally refusing to give any information to relatives of the victims  The human rights NGO directly investigated three such cases and received additional information about over twenty possible executions during a visit to the zone   According to HRW  those extrajudicial executions would qualify as forced disappearances if they had been carried out by agents of the government or on its behalf  but nevertheless remained  blatant violations of the FARC EP s obligations under international humanitarian law and in particular key provisions of article 4 of Protocol II  which protects against violence to the life  physical  and mental well being of persons  torture  and ill treatment    The Colombian human rights organization CINEP reported that FARC EP killed an estimated total of 496 civilians during 2000   3 3  Use of gas cylinder mortars and landmines  The FARC EP has employed a type of improvised mortars made from gas canisters  or cylinders   when launching attacks   According to Human Rights Watch  the FARC EP has killed civilians not involved in the conflict through the use of gas cylinder mortars and its use of landmines   Human Rights Watch considers that  the FARC EP s continued use of gas cylinder mortars shows this armed group s flagrant disregard for lives of civilians   gas cylinder bombs are impossible to aim with accuracy and  as a result  frequently strike civilian objects and cause avoidable civilian casualties    According to the ICBL Landmine and Cluster Munitions Monitor   FARC is probably the most prolific current user of antipersonnel mines among rebel groups anywhere in the world   Furthermore  FARC use child soldiers to carry and deploy antipersonnel mines   3 4  Violence against indigenous people  FARC has sometimes threatened or assassinated indigenous Colombian leaders for attempting to prevent FARC incursions into their territory and resisting the forcible recruitment by FARC of indigenous youth  Between 1986 and 2001  FARC was responsible for 27 assassinations  15 threats  and 14 other abuses of indigenous people in Antioquia Department  In March 1999 members of a local FARC contingent killed 3 indigenous rights activists  who were working with the U Wa people to build a school for U Wa children  and were fighting against encroachment of U Wa territory by multinational oil corporations  The killings were almost universally condemned  and seriously harmed public perceptions of FARC   Members of indigenous groups have demanded the removal of military bases set up by the Colombian government and guerrilla encampments established by FARC in their territories  claiming that both the Colombian National Army and the FARC should respect indigenous autonomy and international humanitarian law  According to the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia  ONIC   80 000 members of indigenous communities have been displaced from their native lands since 2004 because of FARC related violence  Luis Evelis  an indigenous leader and ONIC representative  has stated that  the armed conflict is still in force  causing damages to the indigenous  Our territories are self governed and we demand our autonomy  During the year 2011  fifty six indigenous people have been killed   The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has indicated that no military activities may be carry out within indigenous territories without first undertaking an  effective consultation  with indigenous representatives and authorities from the communities involved   The Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca  CRIC  issued a statement concerning the release of two hostages taken by FARC in 2011   Compared to past statements made by the national government  it is important to reiterate that the presence of armed groups in our territories is a fact that has been imposed by force of arms  against which our communities and their leaders have remained in peaceful resistance   The CRIC also indicated that neither the Colombian government nor the mediators and armed groups involved consulted with the indigenous people and their authorities about the hostage release  raising concerns about the application of national and international law guaranteeing their autonomy  self determination and self government  The indigenous organization also demanded the immediate end of all violence and conflict within indigenous territories and called for a negotiated solution to the war   Official Colombian government statistics show that murders of indigenous people between January and May 2011 have increased 38% compared to the same timeframe in 2010  Colombia is home to nearly 1 million indigenous people  divided into around 100 different ethnicities  The Colombian Constitutional Court has warned that 35 of those groups are in danger of dying out  The Permanent Assembly for the Defense of Life and Territorial Control has stated that the armed conflict  is not only part of one or two areas  it is a problem of all the indigenous people    3 5  Sexual abuse and forced abortions  According to Amnesty International  both civilian women and female combatants have been sexually exploited or victimized by all of the different parties involved in the Colombian armed conflict  In the case of FARC  it has been reported that young female recruits have been sexually abused by veteran guerrilla soldiers and in several cases pregnancies were aborted against their will by FARC doctors   4  Organization and structure  FARC EP remains the largest and oldest insurgent group in the Americas  According to the Colombian government  FARC EP had an estimated 6 000–8 000 members in 2008  down from 16 000 in 2001  having lost much of their fighting force since President Álvaro Uribe took office in 2002  Political analyst and former guerrilla León Valencia has estimated that FARC s numbers have been reduced to around 11 000 from their 18 000 peak but cautions against considering the group a defeated force  In 2007 FARC EP Commander Raúl Reyes claimed that their force consisted of 18 000 guerrillas   The largest concentrations of FARC EP guerrillas are located throughout the southeastern parts of Colombia s of jungle and in the plains at the base of the Andean mountains   FARC s organized hierarchically into military units as follows   Central High Command – composed of a five member Secretariat  one of them being the  Commander in Chief  and two  supplements   Coordinates the activities of the individual blocks  and determines overall strategy of FARC EP   Estado Mayor Central – 25 members  who also coordinate activities of blocks  Block – 5+ Fronts  with each block corresponding to one of Colombia s geographical regions  south  central  east  west  Middle Magdalena  Caribbean  and Cesar   Front – 1+ Columns  Within each Front  there are combat  support  and infrastructure elements   Column – 2+ Companies  Company – 2+ Guerrillas  Guerrilla – 2 Squads  Squad – +   12 combatants The FARC EP secretariat was led by Alfonso Cano and six others after the death of Manuel Marulanda  Pedro Antonio Marín   also known as  Tirofijo   or Sureshot in 2008  The  international spokesman  of the organization was represented by  Raul Reyes   who was killed in a Colombian army raid against a guerrilla camp in Ecuador on 1 March 2008  Cano was killed in a military operation on 4 November 2011   FARC EP remains open to a negotiated solution to the nation s conflict through dialogue with a flexible government that agrees to certain conditions  such as the demilitarization of certain areas  cessation of paramilitary and government violence against rural peasants  social reforms to reduce poverty and inequality  and the release of all jailed  and extradited  FARC EP rebels  It claims that until these conditions surface  the armed revolutionary struggle will remain necessary to fight against Colombia s elites  The FARC EP says it will continue its armed struggle because it perceives the current Colombian government as an enemy because of historical politically motivated violence against its members and supporters including members of the Patriotic Union  a FARC EP created political party   5  See also
