Transhumanism  abbreviated as H+ or h+  is an international cultural and intellectual movement with an eventual goal of fundamentally transforming the human condition by developing and making widely available technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual  physical  and psychological capacities  Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations  as well as the ethics of developing and using such technologies  The most common thesis put forward is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings with such greatly expanded abilities as to merit the label posthuman   The contemporary meaning of the term transhumanism was foreshadowed by one of the first professors of futurology  FM 2030  who taught  new concepts of the human  at The New School in the 1960s  when he began to identify people who adopt technologies  lifestyles and worldviews  transitional  to posthumanity as  transhuman   This hypothesis would lay the intellectual groundwork for the British philosopher Max More to begin articulating the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy in 1990 and organizing in California an intelligentsia that has since grown into the worldwide transhumanist movement   Influenced by seminal works of science fiction  the transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives  Transhumanism has been characterized by one critic  Francis Fukuyama  as among the world s most dangerous ideas  to which Ronald Bailey countered that it is rather the  movement that epitomizes the most daring  courageous  imaginative and idealistic aspirations of humanity    1  History  According to Nick Bostrom  transcendentalist impulses have been expressed at least as far back as in the quest for immortality in the Epic of Gilgamesh  as well as in historical quests for the Fountain of Youth  the Elixir of Life  and other efforts to stave off aging and death   There is debate about whether the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche can be considered an influence on transhumanism despite its exaltation of the  Übermensch   overman or superman   due to its emphasis on self actualization  rather than technological transformation  The transhumanist philosophies by Max More and Stefan Lorenz Sorgner have been influenced strongly by Nietzschean thinking   1 1  Early transhumanist thinking  Fundamental ideas of transhumanism were first noted in 1923 by the British geneticist J  B  S  Haldane in his essay Daedalus  Science and the Future  which predicted that great benefits would come from applications of advanced sciences to human biology—and that every such advance would first appear to someone as blasphemy or perversion   indecent and unnatural   In particular  he was interested in the development of the science of eugenics  ectogenesis  creating and sustaining life in an artificial environment  and the application of genetics to improve human characteristics  such as health and intelligence   His article inspired academic and popular interest  J  D  Bernal  a crystallographer at Cambridge  wrote The World  the Flesh and the Devil in 1929  in which he speculated on the prospects of space colonization and radical changes to human bodies and intelligence through bionic implants and cognitive enhancement  These ideas have been common transhumanist themes ever since   The biologist Julian Huxley is generally regarded as the founder of transhumanism  after he coined the term in an article written in 1957   This definition differs  albeit not substantially  from the one commonly in use since the 1980s  The ideas raised by these thinkers were explored in the science fiction of the 1960s  notably in Arthur C  Clarke s 2001  A Space Odyssey  in which an alien artifact grants transcendent power to its wielder   1 2  Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity  The concept of the technological singularity  or the ultra rapid advent of superhuman intelligence  was first proposed by the British cryptologist I  J  Good in 1965   Computer scientist Marvin Minsky wrote on relationships between human and artificial intelligence beginning in the 1960s  Over the succeeding decades  this field continued to generate influential thinkers such as Hans Moravec and Raymond Kurzweil  who oscillated between the technical arena and futuristic speculations in the transhumanist vein  The coalescence of an identifiable transhumanist movement began in the last decades of the 20th century  In 1966  FM 2030  formerly F  M  Esfandiary   a futurist who taught  new concepts of the human  at The New School  in New York City  began to identify people who adopt technologies  lifestyles and world views transitional to posthumanity as  transhuman   In 1972  Robert Ettinger contributed to the conceptualization of  transhumanity  in his book Man into Superman  FM 2030 published the Upwingers Manifesto in 1973   1 3  Growth of transhumanism  The first self described transhumanists met formally in the early 1980s at the University of California  Los Angeles  which became the main center of transhumanist thought  Here  FM 2030 lectured on his  Third Way  futurist ideology  At the EZTV Media venue  frequented by transhumanists and other futurists  Natasha Vita More presented Breaking Away  her 1980 experimental film with the theme of humans breaking away from their biological limitations and the Earth s gravity as they head into space  FM 2030 and Vita More soon began holding gatherings for transhumanists in Los Angeles  which included students from FM 2030 s courses and audiences from Vita More s artistic productions  In 1982  Vita More authored the Transhumanist Arts Statement and  six years later  produced the cable TV show TransCentury Update on transhumanity  a program which reached over 100 000 viewers   In 1986  Eric Drexler published Engines of Creation  The Coming Era of Nanotechnology  which discussed the prospects for nanotechnology and molecular assemblers  and founded the Foresight Institute  As the first non profit organization to research  advocate for  and perform cryonics  the Southern California offices of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation became a center for futurists  In 1988  the first issue of Extropy Magazine was published by Max More and Tom Morrow  In 1990  More  a strategic philosopher  created his own particular transhumanist doctrine  which took the form of the Principles of Extropy  and laid the foundation of modern transhumanism by giving it a new definition   In 1992  More and Morrow founded the Extropy Institute  a catalyst for networking futurists and brainstorming new memeplexes by organizing a series of conferences and  more importantly  providing a mailing list  which exposed many to transhumanist views for the first time during the rise of cyberculture and the cyberdelic counterculture  In 1998  philosophers Nick Bostrom and David Pearce founded the World Transhumanist Association  WTA   an international non governmental organization working toward the recognition of transhumanism as a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and public policy  In 2002  the WTA modified and adopted The Transhumanist Declaration  The Transhumanist FAQ  prepared by the WTA  gave two formal definitions for transhumanism   A number of similar definitions have been collected by Anders Sandberg  an academic and prominent transhumanist   In possible contrast with other transhumanist organizations  WTA officials considered that social forces could undermine their futurist visions and needed to be addressed  A particular concern is the equal access to human enhancement technologies across classes and borders  In 2006  a political struggle within the transhumanist movement between the libertarian right and the liberal left resulted in a more centre leftward positioning of the WTA under its former executive director James Hughes  In 2006  the board of directors of the Extropy Institute ceased operations of the organization  stating that its mission was  essentially completed   This left the World Transhumanist Association as the leading international transhumanist organization  In 2008  as part of a rebranding effort  the WTA changed its name to  Humanity+   Humanity+ and Betterhumans publish h+ Magazine  a periodical edited by R  U  Sirius which disseminates transhumanist news and ideas  In 2012  the transhumanist Longevity Party had been initiated as an international union of people who promote the development of scientific and technological means to significant life extension  that for now has more than 30 national organisations   Transhumanist themed blogs by Zoltan Istvan are in mainstream media on Psychology Today and The Huffington Post   The first transhumanist elected member of a Parliament is Giuseppe Vatinno  in Italy   2  Theory  It is a matter of debate whether transhumanism is a branch of posthumanism and how this philosophical movement should be conceptualised with regard to transhumanism  The latter is often referred to as a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its conservative  Christian and progressive critics   A common feature of transhumanism and philosophical posthumanism is the future vision of a new intelligent species  into which humanity will evolve and eventually will supplement or supersede it  Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective  including sometimes the creation of a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement  i e  biological uplift   but clings to a  posthuman future  as the final goal of participant evolution   Nevertheless  the idea of creating intelligent artificial beings  proposed  for example  by roboticist Hans Moravec  has influenced transhumanism  Moravec s ideas and transhumanism have also been characterised as a  complacent  or  apocalyptic  variant of posthumanism and contrasted with  cultural posthumanism  in humanities and the arts  While such a  cultural posthumanism  would offer resources for rethinking the relationships between humans and increasingly sophisticated machines  transhumanism and similar posthumanisms are  in this view  not abandoning obsolete concepts of the  autonomous liberal subject   but are expanding its  prerogatives  into the realm of the posthuman  Transhumanist self characterisations as a continuation of humanism and Enlightenment thinking correspond with this view   Some secular humanists conceive transhumanism as an offspring of the humanist freethought movement and argue that transhumanists differ from the humanist mainstream by having a specific focus on technological approaches to resolving human concerns  i e  technocentrism  and on the issue of mortality  However  other progressives have argued that posthumanism  whether it be its philosophical or activist forms  amounts to a shift away from concerns about social justice  from the reform of human institutions and from other Enlightenment preoccupations  toward narcissistic longings for a transcendence of the human body in quest of more exquisite ways of being  In this view  transhumanism is abandoning the goals of humanism  the Enlightenment and progressive politics   As an alternative  humanist philosopher Dwight Gilbert Jones has proposed a renewed Renaissance humanism through DNA and genome repositories  with each individual genotype  DNA  being instantiated as successive phenotypes  bodies or lives via cloning  Church of Man  1978   In his view  native molecular DNA  continuity  is required for retaining the  self  and no amount of computing power or memory aggregation can replace the essential  stink  of our true genetic identity  which he terms     Instead  DNA genome stewardship by an institution analogous to the Jesuits  400 year vigil is a suggested model for enabling humanism to become our species  common credo  a project he proposed in his speculative novel The Humanist   1000 Summers  2011   wherein humanity dedicates these coming centuries to harmonizing our planet and peoples   The philosophy of transhumanism is closely related to technoself studies  an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society focusing on the changing nature of relationships between humans and technology   2 1  Aims  While many transhumanist theorists and advocates seek to apply reason  science and technology for the purposes of reducing poverty  disease  disability and malnutrition around the globe  transhumanism is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level  Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems to improve the quality of all life  while seeking to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of legal and political equality by eliminating congenital mental and physical barriers   Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a perfectionist ethical imperative for humans to strive for progress and improvement of the human condition  but that it is possible and desirable for humanity to enter a transhuman phase of existence in which humans are in control of their own evolution  In such a phase  natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate change   Some theorists such as Raymond Kurzweil think that the pace of technological innovation is accelerating and that the next 50 years may yield not only radical technological advances  but possibly a technological singularity  which may fundamentally change the nature of human beings  Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable  However  some are also concerned with the possible dangers of extremely rapid technological change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly  For example  Bostrom has written extensively on existential risks to humanity s future welfare  including ones that could be created by emerging technologies   While many people believe that all transhumanists are striving for immortality  it is not necessarily true  Hank Pellissier  managing director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies  2011 2012   surveyed transhumanists  He found that  of the 818 respondents  23 8% did not want immortality  Some of the reasons argued were boredom  Earth’s overpopulation and the desire  to go to an afterlife    2 2  Ethics  Transhumanists engage in interdisciplinary approaches to understand and evaluate possibilities for overcoming biological limitations by drawing on futurology and various fields of ethics  Unlike many philosophers  social critics and activists who place a moral value on preservation of natural systems  transhumanists see the very concept of the specifically natural as problematically nebulous at best and an obstacle to progress at worst  In keeping with this  many prominent transhumanist advocates refer to transhumanism s critics  on the political right and left jointly  as  bioconservatives  or  bioluddites   the latter term alluding to the 19th century anti industrialisation social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines   A belief of counter transhumanism is that transhumanism can cause unfair human enhancement in many areas of life  but specifically on the social plane  This can be compared to steroid use  where athletes who use steroids in sports have an advantage over those who do not  The same scenario happens when people have certain neural implants that give them an advantage in the work place and in educational aspects   2 3  Currents  There is a variety of opinions within transhumanist thought  Many of the leading transhumanist thinkers hold views that are under constant revision and development  Some distinctive currents of transhumanism are identified and listed here in alphabetical order   Abolitionism  an ethical ideology based upon a perceived obligation to use technology to eliminate involuntary suffering in all sentient life   Democratic transhumanism  a political ideology synthesizing liberal democracy  social democracy  radical democracy and transhumanism   Extropianism  an early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a proactive approach to human evolution   Immortalism  a moral ideology based upon the belief that radical life extension and technological immortality is possible and desirable  and advocating research and development to ensure its realization   Libertarian transhumanism  a political ideology synthesizing libertarianism and transhumanism   Postgenderism  a social philosophy which seeks the voluntary elimination of gender in the human species through the application of advanced biotechnology and assisted reproductive technologies   Singularitarianism  a moral ideology based upon the belief that a technological singularity is possible  and advocating deliberate action to effect it and ensure its safety   Technogaianism  an ecological ideology based upon the belief that emerging technologies can help restore Earth s environment and that developing safe  clean  alternative technology should therefore be an important goal of environmentalists   2 4  Spirituality  Although some transhumanists report having religious or spiritual views  they are for the most part atheists  agnostics or secular humanists  Despite the prevailing secular attitude  some transhumanists pursue hopes traditionally espoused by religions  such as immortality  while several controversial new religious movements from the late 20th century have explicitly embraced transhumanist goals of transforming the human condition by applying technology to the alteration of the mind and body  such as Raëlism  However  most thinkers associated with the transhumanist movement focus on the practical goals of using technology to help achieve longer and healthier lives  while speculating that future understanding of neurotheology and the application of neurotechnology will enable humans to gain greater control of altered states of consciousness  which were commonly interpreted as spiritual experiences  and thus achieve more profound self knowledge  Transhumanist Buddhists have sought to explore areas of agreement between various types of Buddhism and Buddhist derived meditation and mind expanding  neurotechnologies    Cyborg Buddhists  have been criticised for appropriating mindfulness as a tool for transcending humanness   Many transhumanists believe in the compatibility between the human mind and computer hardware  with the theoretical implication that human consciousness may someday be transferred to alternative media  a speculative technique commonly known as mind uploading   One extreme formulation of this idea  which some transhumanists are interested in  is the proposal of the Omega Point by Christian cosmologist Frank Tipler  Drawing upon ideas in digitalism  Tipler has advanced the notion that the collapse of the Universe billions of years hence could create the conditions for the perpetuation of humanity in a simulated reality within a megacomputer and thus achieve a form of  posthuman godhood   Tipler s thought was inspired by the writings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin  a paleontologist and Jesuit theologian who saw an evolutionary telos in the development of an encompassing noosphere  a global consciousness   Viewed from the perspective of some Christian thinkers  the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a denigration of the human body  characteristic of gnostic manichaean belief  Transhumanism and its presumed intellectual progenitors have also been described as neo gnostic by non Christian and secular commentators   The first dialogue between transhumanism and faith was a one day conference held at the University of Toronto in 2004  Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor a relationship with the divine  They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and anomie  Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy  which  far from being cynical  is rooted in optimistic  idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment  Following this dialogue  William Sims Bainbridge  a sociologist of religion  conducted a pilot study  published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology  suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct  competitive  though ultimately futile  affront to their spiritual beliefs   Since 2009  the American Academy of Religion holds a  Transhumanism and Religion  consultation during its annual meeting  where scholars in the field of religious studies seek to identify and critically evaluate any implicit religious beliefs that might underlie key transhumanist claims and assumptions  consider how transhumanism challenges religious traditions to develop their own ideas of the human future  in particular the prospect of human transformation  whether by technological or other means  and provide critical and constructive assessments of an envisioned future that place greater confidence in nanotechnology  robotics and information technology to achieve virtual immortality and create a superior posthuman species   The physicist and transhumanist thinker Giulio Prisco states that  cosmist religions based on science  might be our best protection from reckless pursuit of superintelligence and other risky technologies   Prisco also recognizes the importance of spiritual ideas  as the ones of Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov to the origins of the transhumanism moviment   3  Practice  While some transhumanists take an abstract and theoretical approach to the perceived benefits of emerging technologies  others have offered specific proposals for modifications to the human body  including heritable ones  Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human nervous system  Though some propose modification of the peripheral nervous system  the brain is considered the common denominator of personhood and is thus a primary focus of transhumanist ambitions   As proponents of self improvement and body modification  transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance  while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity  Depending on their age  some transhumanists express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies  However  many have a great interest in life extension strategies and in funding research in cryonics in order to make the latter a viable option of last resort  rather than remaining an unproven method  Regional and global transhumanist networks and communities with a range of objectives exist to provide support and forums for discussion and collaborative projects   3 1  Technologies of interest  Transhumanists support the emergence and convergence of technologies including nanotechnology  biotechnology  information technology and cognitive science  NBIC   as well as hypothetical future technologies like simulated reality  artificial intelligence  superintelligence  mind uploading  chemical brain preservation and cryonics  They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become more than human  Therefore  they support the recognition and or protection of cognitive liberty  morphological freedom and procreative liberty as civil liberties  so as to guarantee individuals the choice of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children  Some speculate that human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies may facilitate more radical human enhancement no later than at the midpoint of the 21st century  Kurzweil s book The Singularity is Near and Michio Kaku s book Physics of the Future outline various human enhancement technologies and give insight on how these technologies may impact the human race   Some reports on the converging technologies and NBIC concepts have criticised their transhumanist orientation and alleged science fictional character  At the same time  research on brain and body alteration technologies has been accelerated under the sponsorship of the U  S  Department of Defense  which is interested in the battlefield advantages they would provide to the supersoldiers of the United States and its allies  There has already been a brain research program to  extend the ability to manage information   while military scientists are now looking at stretching the human capacity for combat to a maximum 168 hours without sleep   Neuroscientist Anders Sandberg has been practicing on the method of scanning ultra thin sections of the brain  This method is being used to help better understand the architecture of the brain  As of now  this method is currently being used on mice  This is the first step towards uploading contents of the human brain  including memories and emotions  onto a computer   4  Arts and culture  Transhumanist themes have become increasingly prominent in various literary forms during the period in which the movement itself has emerged  Contemporary science fiction often contains positive renditions of technologically enhanced human life set in utopian  especially techno utopian  societies  However  science fiction s depictions of enhanced humans or other posthuman beings frequently come with a cautionary twist  The more pessimistic scenarios include many horrific or dystopian tales of human bioengineering gone wrong  In the decades immediately before transhumanism emerged as an explicit movement  many transhumanist concepts and themes began appearing in the speculative fiction of authors of the Golden Age of Science Fiction such as Robert A  Heinlein  Lazarus Long series  1941 87   A  E  van Vogt  Slan  1946   Isaac Asimov  I  Robot  1950   Arthur C  Clarke  Childhood s End  1953  and Stanisław Lem  Cyberiad  1967   C  S  Lewis  That Hideous Strength  1945  contains an early critique of transhumanism   In a series of science fiction novels by Neal Asher  the protagonist is an augmented human who carries out missions for  Earth Central Security   an artificial intelligence and superhuman coalition  The author portrays a variety of augmentations in addition to the copying of memory and human minds into crystals and the presence of both benevolent and malevolent artificial intelligences   The cyberpunk genre  exemplified by William Gibson s Neuromancer  1984  and Bruce Sterling s Schismatrix  1985   has particularly been concerned with the modification of human bodies  Other novels dealing with transhumanist themes that have stimulated broad discussion of these issues include Blood Music  1985   by Greg Bear  The Xenogenesis Trilogy  1987 1989   by Octavia Butler  The Beggar s Trilogy  1990 94   by Nancy Kress  much of Greg Egan s work since the early 1990s such as Permutation City  1994  and Diaspora  1997   The Culture series of Iain M  Banks  The Bohr Maker  1995   by Linda Nagata  Altered Carbon  2002   by Richard K  Morgan  Oryx and Crake  2003   by Margaret Atwood  The Elementary Particles  Eng  trans  2001  and The Possibility of an Island  Eng  trans  2006   by Michel Houellebecq  Mindscan  2005   by Robert J  Sawyer  the Commonwealth Saga  2002 10   by Peter F  Hamilton  and Glasshouse  2005   by Charles Stross  Some of these works are considered part of the cyberpunk genre or its postcyberpunk offshoot   The Dan Brown novel Inferno and the Zoltan Istvan novel The Transhumanist Wager focus on the theme of transhumanism   Fictional transhumanist scenarios have also become popular in other media during the late 20th and early 21st centuries  Such treatments are found in comic books  Captain America  1941  Transmetropolitan  1997  The Surrogates  2006   films  2001  A Space Odyssey  1968  Blade Runner  1982  Gattaca  1997   television series  the Cybermen of Doctor Who  1966  the Borg of Star Trek  The Next Generation  1989   manga and anime  Galaxy Express 999  1978  Appleseed  1985  Ghost in the Shell  1989  Neon Genesis Evangelion  1995  and the Gundam metaseries  1979   video games  Metal Gear Solid  1998  Deus Ex  2000  BioShock  2008  Half Life 2  2004  Crysis  2007  Deus Ex  Human Revolution  2011  and role playing games   Carnal Art  a form of sculpture originated by the French artist Orlan  uses the body as its medium and plastic surgery as its method  The French biological anthropologist Dr  Judith Nicogossian also works on representations of the hybrid body   5  Debate  The very notion and prospect of human enhancement and related issues arouse public controversy  Criticisms of transhumanism and its proposals take two main forms  those objecting to the likelihood of transhumanist goals being achieved  practical criticisms  and those objecting to the moral principles or worldview sustaining transhumanist proposals or underlying transhumanism itself  ethical criticisms   Nonetheless  these two strains sometimes converge and overlap  particularly when considering the ethics of changing human biology in the face of incomplete knowledge   Critics or opponents often see transhumanists  goals as posing threats to human values  Some also argue that strong advocacy of a transhumanist approach to improving the human condition might divert attention and resources from social solutions  Sometimes  however  there are strong disagreements about the very principles involved  with divergent views on humanity  human nature and the morality of transhumanist aspirations  At least one public interest organization  the U S  based Center for Genetics and Society  was formed  in 2001  with the specific goal of opposing transhumanist agendas that involve transgenerational modification of human biology  such as full term human cloning and germinal choice technology  The Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future of the Chicago Kent College of Law critically scrutinizes proposed applications of genetic and nanotechnologies to human biology in an academic setting   Some of the most widely known critiques of the transhumanist program refer to novels and fictional films  These works of art  despite presenting imagined worlds rather than philosophical analyses  are used as touchstones for some of the more formal arguments   5 1  Feasibility  In a 1992 book  sociologist Max Dublin pointed to many past failed predictions of technological progress and argued that modern futurist predictions would prove similarly inaccurate  He also objected to what he saw as scientism  fanaticism and nihilism by a few in advancing transhumanist causes  Dublin also said that historical parallels existed between Millenarian religions and Communist doctrines   Although generally sympathetic to transhumanism  public health professor Gregory Stock is skeptical of the technical feasibility and mass appeal of the cyborgization of humanity predicted by Raymond Kurzweil  Hans Moravec and Kevin Warwick  He said that  throughout the 21st century  many humans would find themselves deeply integrated into systems of machines  but would remain biological  Primary changes to their own form and character would arise not from cyberware  but from the direct manipulation of their genetics  metabolism and biochemistry   Thinkers who defend the likelihood of accelerating change point to a past pattern of exponential increases in humanity s technological capacities  Kurzweil developed this position in his 2005 book The Singularity Is Near   5 2  Hubris  It has been argued that  in transhumanist thought  humans attempt to substitute themselves for God  This approach is exemplified by the 2002 Vatican statement Communion and Stewardship  Human Persons Created in the Image of God  in which it is stated that  changing the genetic identity of man as a human person through the production of an infrahuman being is radically immoral   implying  as it would  that  man has full right of disposal over his own biological nature   At the same time  this statement argues that creation of a superhuman or spiritually superior being is  unthinkable   since true improvement can come only through religious experience and  realizing more fully the image of God   Christian theologians and lay activists of several churches and denominations have expressed similar objections to transhumanism and claimed that Christians attain in the afterlife what radical transhumanism promises  such as indefinite life extension or the abolition of suffering  In this view  transhumanism is just another representative of the long line of utopian movements which seek to create  heaven on earth    Another critique is aimed mainly at  algeny   a portmanteau of alchemy and genetics   which Jeremy Rifkin defined as  the upgrading of existing organisms and the design of wholly new ones with the intent of  perfecting  their performance   More specifically  it attempts to pursue transhumanist goals by way of genetically modifying human embryos in order to create  designer babies   It emphasizes the issue of biocomplexity and the unpredictability of attempts to guide the development of products of biological evolution  This argument  elaborated in particular by the biologist Stuart Newman  is based on the recognition that cloning and germline genetic engineering of animals are error prone and inherently disruptive of embryonic development  Accordingly  so it is argued  it would create unacceptable risks to use such methods on human embryos  Performing experiments  particularly ones with permanent biological consequences  on developing humans would thus be in violation of accepted principles governing research on human subjects  see the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki   Moreover  because improvements in experimental outcomes in one species are not automatically transferable to a new species without further experimentation  it is claimed that there is no ethical route to genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages   As a practical matter  however  international protocols on human subject research may not present a legal obstacle to attempts by transhumanists and others to improve their offspring by germinal choice technology  According to legal scholar Kirsten Rabe Smolensky  existing laws would protect parents who choose to enhance their child s genome from future liability arising from adverse outcomes of the procedure   Religious thinkers allied with transhumanist goals  such as the theologians Ronald Cole Turner and Ted Peters  reject the first argument  holding that the doctrine of  co creation  provides an obligation to use genetic engineering to improve human biology   Transhumanists and other supporters of human genetic engineering do not dismiss the second argument out of hand  insofar as there is a high degree of uncertainty about the likely outcomes of genetic modification experiments in humans  However  bioethicist James Hughes suggests that one possible ethical route to the genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages is the building of computer models of the human genome  the proteins it specifies and the tissue engineering he argues that it also codes for  With the exponential progress in bioinformatics  Hughes believes that a virtual model of genetic expression in the human body will not be far behind and that it will soon be possible to accelerate approval of genetic modifications by simulating their effects on virtual humans  Public health professor Gregory Stock points to artificial chromosomes as an alleged safer alternative to existing genetic engineering techniques  Transhumanists  therefore  argue that parents have a moral responsibility called procreative beneficence to make use of these methods  if and when they are shown to be reasonably safe and effective  to have the healthiest children possible  They add that this responsibility is a moral judgment best left to individual conscience  rather than imposed by law  in all but extreme cases  In this context  the emphasis on freedom of choice is called procreative liberty   5 3  Contempt for the flesh  In her 1992 book Science as Salvation  philosopher Mary Midgley traces the notion of achieving immortality by transcendence of the material human body  echoed in the transhumanist tenet of mind uploading  to a group of male scientific thinkers of the early 20th century  including J  B  S  Haldane and members of his circle  She characterizes these ideas as  quasi scientific dreams and prophesies  involving visions of escape from the body coupled with  self indulgent  uncontrolled power fantasies   Her argument focuses on what she perceives as the pseudoscientific speculations and irrational  fear of death driven fantasies of these thinkers  their disregard for laymen and the remoteness of their eschatological visions   What is perceived as contempt for the flesh in the writings of Marvin Minsky  Hans Moravec and some transhumanists has also been the target of other critics for what they claim to be an instrumental conception of the human body  Reflecting a strain of feminist criticism of the transhumanist program  philosopher Susan Bordo points to  contemporary obsessions with slenderness  youth and physical perfection   which she sees as affecting both men and women  but in distinct ways  as  the logical  if extreme  manifestations of anxieties and fantasies fostered by our culture   Some critics question other social implications of the movement s focus on body modification  Political scientist Klaus Gerd Giesen  in particular  has asserted that transhumanism s concentration on altering the human body represents the logical yet tragic consequence of atomized individualism and body commodification within a consumer culture  Artist and filmmaker Tim Holmes sees a similar but subtler danger in the devaluation of the body by the progress of civilization itself  which he says encourages mechanical values of expediency  rather than body values of quality of life  leading us to ever more mechanical  anti flesh solutions  In his TED talk  The Erotic Crisis   he warns against abandoning the hidden wisdom of the flesh  which cannot be digitally comprehended   Nick Bostrom asserts that the desire to regain youth  specifically  and transcend the natural limitations of the human body  in general  is pan cultural and pan historical  and is therefore not uniquely tied to the culture of the 20th century  He argues that the transhumanist program is an attempt to channel that desire into a scientific project on par with the Human Genome Project and achieve humanity s oldest hope  rather than a puerile fantasy or social trend   5 4  Trivialization of human identity  In his 2003 book Enough  Staying Human in an Engineered Age  environmental ethicist Bill McKibben argued at length against many of the technologies that are postulated or supported by transhumanists  including germinal choice technology  nanomedicine and life extension strategies  He claims that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves  or their children  in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations  such as vulnerability to aging  maximum life span and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability  Attempts to  improve  themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice  He claims that human lives would no longer seem meaningful in a world where such limitations could be overcome technologically  Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished  since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities  He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies  using as examples Ming China  Tokugawa Japan and the contemporary Amish   Giuseppe Vattino  a supporter of transhumanism elected as a member of Parliament in Italy  believes that  although transhumanism may make us less human  there are both positive and negative consequences  He believes that transhumanism will make people “less subject to the whims of nature  such as illness or climate extremes”   Transhumanists and other supporters of technological alteration of human biology  such as science journalist Ronald Bailey  reject as extremely subjective the claim that life would be experienced as meaningless if some human limitations are overcome with enhancement technologies  They argue that these technologies will not remove the bulk of the individual and social challenges humanity faces  They suggest that a person with greater abilities would tackle more advanced and difficult projects and continue to find meaning in the struggle to achieve excellence  Bailey also claims that McKibben s historical examples are flawed and support different conclusions when studied more closely  For example  few groups are more cautious than the Amish about embracing new technologies  but  though they shun television and use horses and buggies  some are welcoming the possibilities of gene therapy since inbreeding has afflicted them with a number of rare genetic diseases   5 5  Genetic divide  Some critics of libertarian transhumanism have focused on the likely socioeconomic consequences in societies in which divisions between rich and poor are on the rise  Bill McKibben  for example  suggests that emerging human enhancement technologies would be disproportionately available to those with greater financial resources  thereby exacerbating the gap between rich and poor and creating a  genetic divide   Even Lee M  Silver  the biologist and science writer who coined the term  reprogenetics  and supports its applications  has expressed concern that these methods could create a two tiered society of genetically engineered  haves  and  have nots  if social democratic reforms lag behind implementation of enhancement technologies  Critics who make these arguments do not thereby necessarily accept the transhumanist assumption that human enhancement is a positive value  in their view  it should be discouraged  or even banned  because it could confer additional power upon the already powerful  The 1997 film Gattaca depicts a dystopian society in which one s social class depends entirely on genetic modifications and is often cited by critics in support of these views   These criticisms are also voiced by non libertarian transhumanist advocates  especially self described democratic transhumanists  who believe that the majority of current or future social and environmental issues  such as unemployment and resource depletion  need to be addressed by a combination of political and technological solutions  like a guaranteed minimum income and alternative technology   Therefore  on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies  bioethicist James Hughes  in his 2004 book Citizen Cyborg  Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future  argues that progressives or  more precisely  techno progressives must articulate and implement public policies  i e   a universal health care voucher system that covers human enhancement technologies  in order to attenuate this problem as much as possible  rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies  The latter  he argues  might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local black market or in countries where such a ban is not enforced   5 6  Threats to morality and democracy  Various arguments have been made to the effect that a society that adopts human enhancement technologies may come to resemble the dystopia depicted in the 1932 novel Brave New World  by Aldous Huxley  Sometimes  as in the writings of Leon Kass  the fear is that various institutions and practices judged as fundamental to civilized society would be damaged or destroyed  In his 2002 book Our Posthuman Future and in a 2004 Foreign Policy magazine article  political economist and philosopher Francis Fukuyama designates transhumanism the world s most dangerous idea because he believes that it may undermine the egalitarian ideals of democracy  in general  and liberal democracy  in particular  through a fundamental alteration of  human nature   Social philosopher Jürgen Habermas makes a similar argument in his 2003 book The Future of Human Nature  in which he asserts that moral autonomy depends on not being subject to another s unilaterally imposed specifications  Habermas thus suggests that the human  species ethic  would be undermined by embryo stage genetic alteration  Critics such as Kass  Fukuyama and a variety of authors hold that attempts to significantly alter human biology are not only inherently immoral  but also threaten the social order  Alternatively  they argue that implementation of such technologies would likely lead to the  naturalizing  of social hierarchies or place new means of control in the hands of totalitarian regimes  The AI pioneer Joseph Weizenbaum criticizes what he sees as misanthropic tendencies in the language and ideas of some of his colleagues  in particular Marvin Minsky and Hans Moravec  which  by devaluing the human organism per se  promotes a discourse that enables divisive and undemocratic social policies   In a 2004 article in the libertarian monthly Reason  science journalist Ronald Bailey has contested the assertions of Fukuyama by arguing that political equality has never rested on the facts of human biology  He asserts that liberalism was founded not on the proposition of effective equality of human beings  or de facto equality  but on the assertion of an equality in political rights and before the law  or de jure equality  Bailey asserts that the products of genetic engineering may well ameliorate rather than exacerbate human inequality  giving to the many what were once the privileges of the few  Moreover  he argues   the crowning achievement of the Enlightenment is the principle of tolerance   In fact  he says  political liberalism is already the solution to the issue of human and posthuman rights since in liberal societies the law is meant to apply equally to all  no matter how rich or poor  powerful or powerless  educated or ignorant  enhanced or unenhanced  Other thinkers who are sympathetic to transhumanist ideas  such as philosopher Russell Blackford  have also objected to the appeal to tradition and what they see as alarmism  involved in Brave New World type arguments   5 7  Dehumanization  Biopolitical activist Jeremy Rifkin and biologist Stuart Newman accept that biotechnology has the power to make profound changes in organismal identity  They argue against the genetic engineering of human beings because they fear the blurring of the boundary between human and artifact  Philosopher Keekok Lee sees such developments as part of an accelerating trend in modernization in which technology has been used to transform the  natural  into the  artifactual   In the extreme  this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of  monsters  such as human clones  human animal chimeras or bioroids  but even lesser dislocations of humans and non humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic  The film Blade Runner  1982  and the novels The Boys From Brazil  1976  and The Island of Doctor Moreau  1896  depict elements of such scenarios  but Mary Shelley s 1818 novel Frankenstein is most often alluded to by critics who suggest that biotechnologies could create objectified and socially unmoored people as well as subhumans  Such critics propose that strict measures be implemented to prevent what they portray as dehumanizing possibilities from ever happening  usually in the form of an international ban on human genetic engineering   Transhumanists believe that  we are morally obligated to help the human race transcend its biological limits   In fact  they go so far as to call  bioluddites  those who are opposed to them  Though the gamut of transhumanist opinions ranges from those who believe that we will eventually be cyborgs to those who simply want their brains frozen in the hopes of being resuscitated in the future  all have considered the question of the human identity and whether or not it will be compromised  While the concept of being able to do away with negative emotions is appealing in theory  there are possible negative implications  For example  Fukuyama points out that  if we did not have the emotion of aggression   we wouldn’t be able to defend ourselves   These would not only affect our humanity  but also our interactions with others   Writing in Reason magazine  Ronald Bailey has accused opponents of research involving the modification of animals as indulging in alarmism when they speculate about the creation of subhuman creatures with human like intelligence and brains resembling those of Homo sapiens  Bailey insists that the aim of conducting research on animals is simply to produce human health care benefits   A different response comes from transhumanist personhood theorists who object to what they characterize as the anthropomorphobia fueling some criticisms of this research  which science fiction writer Isaac Asimov termed the  Frankenstein complex   They argue that  provided they are self aware  human clones  human animal chimeras and uplifted animals would all be unique persons deserving of respect  dignity  rights and citizenship  They conclude that the coming ethical issue is not the creation of so called monsters  but what they characterize as the  yuck factor  and  human racism   that would judge and treat these creations as monstrous   5 8  Specter of coercive eugenicism  Some critics of transhumanism allege an ableist bias in the use of such concepts as limitations  enhancement and improvement  Some even see the old eugenics  social Darwinist and master race ideologies and programs of the past as warnings of what the promotion of eugenic enhancement technologies might unintentionally encourage  Some fear future  eugenics wars  as the worst case scenario  the return of coercive state sponsored genetic discrimination and human rights violations such as compulsory sterilization of persons with genetic defects  the killing of the institutionalized and  specifically  segregation and genocide of races perceived as inferior  Health law professor George Annas and technology law professor Lori Andrews are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human posthuman caste warfare   For most of its history  eugenics has manifested itself as a movement to sterilize the genetically unfit against their will and encourage the selective breeding of the genetically fit  The major transhumanist organizations strongly condemn the coercion involved in such policies and reject the racist and classist assumptions on which they were based  along with the pseudoscientific notions that eugenic improvements could be accomplished in a practically meaningful time frame through selective human breeding  Instead  most transhumanist thinkers advocate a  new eugenics   a form of egalitarian liberal eugenics  In their 2000 book From Chance to Choice  Genetics and Justice  non transhumanist bioethicists Allen Buchanan  Dan Brock  Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler have argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible  so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals  reproductive rights or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies  in order to maximize public health and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements  Most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term  eugenics   preferring  germinal choice  or  reprogenetics   to avoid having their position confused with the discredited theories and practices of early 20th century eugenic movements   5 9  Existential risks  Struck by a passage from Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski s anarcho primitivist manifesto  quoted in Kurzweil s 1999 book  The Age of Spiritual Machines   computer scientist Bill Joy became a notable critic of emerging technologies  Joy s 2000 essay  Why The Future Doesn t Need Us  argues that human beings would likely guarantee their own extinction by developing the technologies favored by transhumanists  It invokes  for example  the  grey goo scenario   where out of control self replicating nanorobots could consume entire ecosystems  resulting in global ecophagy  Joy s warning was seized upon by appropriate technology organizations such as the ETC Group  Related notions were also voiced by self described neo luddite Kalle Lasn  a culture jammer who co authored a 2001 spoof of Donna Haraway s 1985 Cyborg Manifesto as a critique of the techno utopianism he interpreted it as promoting  Lasn argues that high technology development should be completely relinquished since it inevitably serves corporate interests with devastating consequences on society and the environment   In his 2003 book Our Final Hour  British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees argues that advanced science and technology bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress  However  Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity  Instead  he calls for tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness  Advocates of the precautionary principle  such as many in the environmental movement  also favor slow  careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas  Some precautionists believe that artificial intelligence and robotics present possibilities of alternative forms of cognition that may threaten human life  The Terminator franchise s doomsday depiction of the emergence of an AI that becomes a superintelligence—Skynet  a malignant computer network which initiates a nuclear war in order to exterminate the human species  has often been cited by some involved in this debate   Transhumanists do not necessarily rule out specific restrictions on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of existential risk  Generally  however  they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often unrealistic and sometimes even counter productive as opposed to the technogaian current of transhumanism  which they claim is both realistic and productive  In his television series Connections  science historian James Burke dissects several views on technological change  including precautionism and the restriction of open inquiry  Burke questions the practicality of some of these views  but concludes that maintaining the statu quo of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own  such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet s resources  The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe  clean  alternative technology  rather than fostering what it considers to be anti scientific views and technophobia   One transhumanist solution proposed by Nick Bostrom is differential technological development  a series of attempts to influence the sequence in which technologies are developed  In this approach  planners would strive to retard the development of possibly harmful technologies and their applications  while accelerating the development of likely beneficial technologies  especially those that offer protection against the harmful effects of others  An argument for an  anti progressionist and pessimistic version of transhumanism  has also been presented by Phil Torres  aka  Philippe Verdoux     6  See also  Mind uploading  Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov  Russian cosmism
