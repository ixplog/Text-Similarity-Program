The V 1 flying bomb    —also known to the Allies as the buzz bomb  or doodlebug  and in Germany as Kirschkern  cherrystone  or Maikäfer  maybug —was an early pulse jet powered predecessor of the cruise missile   The V 1 was developed at Peenemünde Army Research Centre by the German Luftwaffe during the Second World War  During initial development it was known by the codename  Cherry Stone   The first of the so called Vergeltungswaffen series designed for terror bombing of London  the V 1 was fired from launch sites along the French  Pas de Calais  and Dutch coasts  The first V 1 was launched at London on 13 June 1944   one week after  and prompted by  the successful Allied landing in Europe  At its peak  more than one hundred V 1s a day were fired at south east England  9 521 in total  decreasing in number as sites were overrun until October 1944  when the last V 1 site in range of Britain was overrun by Allied forces  After this  the V 1s were directed at the port of Antwerp and other targets in Belgium  with 2 448 V 1s being launched  The attacks stopped when the last launch site was overrun on 29 March 1945   The British operated an arrangement of defences  including guns and fighter aircraft  to intercept the bombs before they reached their targets as part of Operation Crossbow  while the launch sites and underground V 1 storage depots were targets of strategic bombing   1  Design and development  In late 1936  while employed by the Argus Motoren company  Fritz Gosslau began work on the further development of remote controlled aircraft  Argus had already developed a remote controlled surveillance aircraft  the AS 292  military designation FZG 43    On 9 November 1939  a proposal for a remote controlled aircraft carrying a payload of over a distance of was forwarded to the RLM  German Air Ministry   Argus joined with Lorentz AG and Arado Flugzeugwerke to develop the project as a private venture  and in April 1940  Gosslau presented an improved study of Project  Fernfeuer  to the RLM  as Project P 35  Erfurt    On 31 May  Rudolf Bree of the RLM commented that he saw no chance that the projectile could be deployed in combat conditions  as the proposed remote control system was seen as a design weakness  Heinrich Koppenberg  the director of Argus  met with Ernst Udet on 6 January 1941 to try to convince him that the development should be continued  but Udet opted to cancel it   Despite this  Gosslau was convinced that the basic idea was sound and proceeded to simplify the design  As an engine manufacturer  Argus lacked the capability to produce a fuselage for the project and Koppenberg sought the assistance of Robert Lusser  chief designer and technical director at Heinkel  On 22 January 1942  Lusser took up a position with the Fieseler aircraft company  He met with Koppenberg on 27 February and was informed of Gosslau s project  Gosslau s design used two pulse jet engines  Lusser improved the design to use a single engine   A final proposal for the project was submitted to the Technical Office of the RLM on 5 June and the project was renamed Fi 103  as Fieseler was to be the chief contractor  On 19 June  Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milch gave Fi 103 production high priority  and development was undertaken at the Luftwaffe s Erprobungsstelle coastal test centre at Karlshagen  part of the Peenemünde West facility   By 30 August  Fieseler had completed the first fuselage  and the first flight of the Fi 103 V7 took place on 10 December  when it was airdropped by a Fw 200   The V 1 was named by The Reich journalist Hans Schwarz Van Berkl in June 1944 with Hitler s approval   2  Description  The V 1 was designed under the codename Kirschkern  cherry stone  by Lusser and Gosslau  with a fuselage constructed mainly of welded sheet steel and wings built of plywood  The simple  Argus built pulse jet engine pulsed 50 times per second  and the characteristic buzzing sound gave rise to the colloquial names  buzz bomb  or  doodlebug   a common name for a wide variety of insects   It was known briefly in Germany  on Hitler s orders  as Maikäfer  May bug  and Krähe  crow    2 1  Power plant  Ignition of the Argus pulse jet was accomplished using an automotive type spark plug located about behind the intake shutters  with current supplied from a portable starting unit  Three air nozzles in the front of the pulse jet were at the same time connected to an external high pressure air source which was used to start the engine  Acetylene gas was typically used for starting  and very often a panel of wood or similar material was held across the end of the tailpipe to prevent the fuel from diffusing and escaping before ignition The V 1 was fueled by of 75 octane gasoline   Once the engine had been started and the temperature had risen to the minimum operating level  the external air hose and connectors were removed and the engine s resonant design kept it firing without any further need for the electrical ignition system  which was used only to ignite the engine when starting   It is a common myth that the V 1 s Argus As 014 pulse jet engine needed a minimum airspeed of to operate  The Argus As 014  also known as a resonant jet  could in fact operate at zero airspeed due to the nature of its intake shutters and its acoustically tuned resonant combustion chamber  Contemporary film footage of the V 1 always shows the distinctive pulsating exhaust of a fully running engine before the catapult system is triggered and the missile launched  The origin of this myth may lie in the fact that due to the low static thrust of the pulse jet engine and the very high stall speed of the small wings  the V 1 could not take off under its own power in a practically short distance  and thus required to either be launched by aircraft catapult or be airlaunched from a modified bomber aircraft such as the Heinkel He 111  Ground launched V 1s were typically propelled up an inclined launch ramp by an apparatus known as a Dampferzeuger   steam generator   which used stabilized hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate  T Stoff and Z Stoff   Takeoff speed was    Beginning in January 1941  the V 1 s pulse jet engine was also tested on a variety of craft  including automobiles and an experimental attack boat known as the  Tornado   The unsuccessful prototype was a version of a Sprengboot  in which a boat loaded with explosives was steered towards a target ship and the pilot would leap out of the back at the last moment  The Tornado was assembled from surplus seaplane hulls connected in catamaran fashion with a small pilot cabin on the cross beams  The Tornado prototype was a noisy underperformer and was abandoned in favour of more conventional piston engined craft   The engine made its first flight aboard a Gotha Go 145 on 30 April 1941   2 2  Guidance system  The V 1 guidance system used a simple autopilot to regulate altitude and airspeed  developed by Askania in Berlin   The RLM at first planned to use a radio control system with the V 1 for precision attacks  but the government decided to instead use the missile against London   A weighted pendulum system provided fore and aft attitude measurement to control pitch  damped by a gyrocompass  which it also stabilized   Operating power for the gyroscope platform and the flight control actuators was provided by two large spherical compressed air tanks which also pressurized the fuel tank  These air tanks were charged to before launch  With the counter determining how far the missile would fly  it was only necessary to launch the V 1 with the ramp pointing in the approximate direction  and the autopilot controlled the flight   There was a more sophisticated interaction between yaw  roll  and other sensors  a gyrocompass  set by swinging in a hangar before launch  gave feedback to control the dynamics of pitch and roll  but it was angled away from the horizontal so that controlling these degrees of freedom interacted  the gyroscope remained true on the basis of feedback received from a magnetic compass  and from the fore and aft pendulum  This interaction meant that rudder control was sufficient for steering and no banking mechanism was needed  In a V 1 which landed in March 1945 without detonating between Tilburg and Goirle  Netherlands  several rolled issues of the German wartime propaganda magazine Signal were found inserted into the left wing s tubular steel spar  used for weight to preset the missile s static equilibrium before launching  It is also known that several of the first buzz bombs to be launched were provided with a small radio transmitter  using a triode valve marked  S3  but being equivalent to a then current power valve  type RL 2 4T1   to check the general direction of flight related to the launching place s and the target s grid coordinates by radio bearing   An odometer driven by a vane anemometer on the nose determined when the target area had been reached  accurately enough for area bombing  Before launch  the counter was set to a value that would reach zero upon arrival at the target in the prevailing wind conditions  As the missile flew  the airflow turned the propeller  and every 30 rotations of the propeller counted down one number on the counter  This counter triggered the arming of the warhead after about   When the count reached zero  two detonating bolts were fired  Two spoilers on the elevator were released  the linkage between the elevator and servo was jammed and a guillotine device cut off the control hoses to the rudder servo  setting the rudder in neutral  These actions put the V 1 into a steep dive  While this was originally intended to be a power dive  in practice the dive caused the fuel flow to cease  which stopped the engine  The sudden silence after the buzzing alerted listeners of the impending impact  The fuel problem was quickly fixed  and when the last V 1s fell  the majority hit under power   3  Operation and effectiveness  The first complete V 1 airframe was delivered 30 August 1942  and after the first complete As 109 014 was delivered in September  the first glide test flight was 28 October 1942 at Peenemünde  from under a Focke Wulf Fw 200  The first powered trial was 10 December  launched from beneath an He 111   A myth arose that early guidance and stabilisation problems were resolved by a daring test flight by Hanna Reitsch in a V 1 modified for manned operation  The myth entered popular consciousness from Reitsch s fictional exploits in the film Operation Crossbow   The conventional launch sites could theoretically launch about 15 V 1s per day  but this rate was difficult to achieve on a consistent basis  the maximum rate achieved was 18  Overall  only about 25% of the V 1s hit their targets  the majority being lost because of a combination of defensive measures  mechanical unreliability  or guidance errors  With the capture or destruction of the launch facilities used to attack England  the V 1s were employed in attacks against strategic points in Belgium  primarily the port of Antwerp   Launches against Britain were met by a variety of countermeasures  including barrage balloons  Hawker Tempests  and even Gloster Meteors  These measures were so successful  by August 1944  about 80% of V 1s were being destroyed   The Meteors  though fast enough to catch the V 1s  suffered frequent cannon failures  and accounted for only 13   In all  about 1 000 V 1s were destroyed by aircraft   The intended operational altitude was originally set at   However  repeated failures of a barometric fuel pressure regulator led to it being changed in May 1944  halving the operational height  thereby bringing V 1s into range of the Bofors guns commonly used by Allied AA units   The trial versions of the V 1 were air launched  Most operational V 1s were launched from static sites on land  but from July 1944 to January 1945  the Luftwaffe launched approximately 1 176 from modified Heinkel He 111 H 22s of the Luftwaffes Kampfgeschwader 3  3rd Bomber Wing  the so called  Blitz Wing   flying over the North Sea  Apart from the obvious motive of permitting the bombardment campaign to continue after static ground sites on the French coast were lost  air launching gave the Luftwaffe the opportunity to outflank the increasingly effective ground and air defences put up by the British against the missile  To minimise the associated risks  primarily radar detection   the aircrews developed a tactic called  lo hi lo   the He 111s would  upon leaving their airbases and crossing the coast  descend to an exceptionally low altitude  When the launch point was neared  the bombers would swiftly ascend  fire their V 1s  and then rapidly descend again to the previous  wave top  level for the return flight  Research after the war estimated a 40% failure rate of air launched V 1s  and the He 111s used in this role were extremely vulnerable to night fighter attack  as the launch lit up the area around the aircraft for several seconds  The combat potential of air launched V 1s dwindled as 1944 progressed at about the same rate as that of the ground launched missiles  as the British gradually took the measure of the weapon and developed increasingly effective defence tactics  For example  during Operation  Martha   KG 3 s He 111H 22s fired 45 V 1s at Britain in a single concerted strike on Christmas Eve 1944  with just one missile getting through to hit a target   4  Experimental and long range variants  Late in the war  several air launched piloted V 1s  known as Reichenbergs  were built  but never used in combat  Hanna Reitsch made some flights in the modified V 1 Fieseler Reichenberg when she was asked to find out why test pilots were unable to land it and had died as a result  She discovered  after simulated landing attempts at high altitude where there was air space to recover  that the craft had an extremely high stall speed and the previous pilots with little high speed experience had attempted their approaches much too slowly  Her recommendation of much higher landing speeds was then introduced in training new Reichenberg volunteer pilots  The Reichenbergs were air launched rather than fired from a catapult ramp as erroneously portrayed in Operation Crossbow   There were plans  not put into practice  to use the Arado Ar 234 jet bomber to launch V 1s either by towing them aloft or by launching them from a  piggy back  position  in the manner of the Mistel  but in reverse  atop the aircraft  In the latter configuration  a pilot controlled  hydraulically operated dorsal trapeze mechanism would elevate the missile on the trapeze s launch cradle some eight feet clear of the 234 s upper fuselage  This was necessary to avoid damaging the mother craft s fuselage and tail surfaces when the pulse jet ignited  as well as to ensure a  clean  airflow for the Argus motor s intake  A somewhat less ambitious project undertaken was the adaptation of the missile as a  flying fuel tank   Deichselschlepp  for the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter  which was initially test towed behind an He 177A Greif bomber  The pulse jet  internal systems and warhead of the missile were removed  leaving only the wings and basic fuselage  now containing a single large fuel tank  A small cylindrical module  similar in shape to a finless dart  was placed atop the vertical stabilizer at the rear of the tank  acting as a centre of gravity balance and attachment point for a variety of equipment sets  A rigid tow bar with a pitch pivot at the forward end connected the flying tank to the Me 262  The operational procedure for this unusual configuration saw the tank resting on a wheeled trolley for take off  The trolley was dropped once the combination was airborne  and explosive bolts separated the towbar from the fighter upon exhaustion of the tank s fuel supply  A number of test flights were conducted in 1944 with this set up  but inflight  porpoising  of the tank  with the instability transferred to the fighter  meant the system was too unreliable to be used  An identical utilisation of the V 1 flying tank for the Ar 234 bomber was also investigated  with the same conclusions reached  Some of the  flying fuel tanks  used in trials utilised a cumbersome fixed and spatted undercarriage arrangement  which  along with being pointless  merely increased the drag and stability problems already inherent in the design   One variant of the basic Fi 103 design did see operational use  The progressive loss of French launch sites as 1944 proceeded and the area of territory under German control shrinking meant that soon the V 1 would lack the range to hit targets in England  Air launching was one alternative utilised  but the most obvious solution was to extend the missile s range  Thus the F 1 version developed  The weapon s fuel tank was increased in size  with a corresponding reduction in the capacity of the warhead  Additionally  the nose cones and wings of the F 1 models were made of wood  affording a considerable weight saving  With these modifications  the V 1 could be fired at London and nearby urban centres from prospective ground sites in the Netherlands  Frantic efforts were made to construct a sufficient number of F 1s in order to allow a large scale bombardment campaign to coincide with the Ardennes Offensive  but numerous factors  bombing of the factories producing the missiles  shortages of steel and rail transport  the chaotic tactical situation Germany was facing at this point in the war etc   delayed the delivery of these long range V 1s until February March 1945  Beginning on March 2  1945  slightly more than three weeks before the V 1 campaign ended for good  several hundred F 1s were launched at Britain from Dutch sites under Operation  Zeppelin    There was also a jet propelled variant proposed   Almost 30 000 V 1s were made  by March 1944  they were produced in 350 hours  including 120 for the autopilot   at a cost of just 4% of a V 2  which delivered a comparable payload  Approximately 10 000 were fired at England  2 419 reached London  killing about 6 184 people and injuring 17 981  The greatest density of hits were received by Croydon  on the south east fringe of London  Antwerp  Belgium was hit by 2 448 V 1s from October 1944 to March 1945   5  Intelligence reports  The codename  Flakzielgerät 76 — Flak aiming apparatus  helped to hide the nature of the device  and it was some time before references to FZG 76 were linked to the V 83 pilotless aircraft  an experimental V 1  that had crashed on Bornholm in the Baltic and to reports from agents of a flying bomb capable of being used against London  Importantly  the Polish Home Army intelligence contributed information on V 1 construction and a place of development  Peenemünde   Initially  British experts were sceptical of the V 1 because they had considered only solid fuel rockets  which could not attain the stated range of   130 miles  209 km   However they later considered other types of engine  and by the time German scientists had achieved the needed accuracy to deploy the V 1 as a weapon  British intelligence had a very accurate assessment of it   6  Countermeasures  6 1  Anti aircraft guns  The British defence against the German long range weapons was Operation Crossbow  Anti aircraft guns were redeployed in several movements  first in mid June 1944 from positions on the North Downs to the south coast of England  then a cordon closing the Thames Estuary to attacks from the east  In September 1944  a new linear defence line was formed on the coast of East Anglia  and finally in December there was a further layout along the Lincolnshire Yorkshire coast  The deployments were prompted by changes to the approach tracks of the V 1 as launch sites were overrun by the Allies  advance   On the first night of sustained bombardment  the anti aircraft crews around Croydon were jubilant – suddenly they were downing unprecedented numbers of German bombers  most of their targets burst into flames and fell when their engines cut out  There was great disappointment when the truth was announced  Anti aircraft gunners soon found that such small fast moving targets were  in fact  very difficult to hit  The cruising altitude of the V 1  between   was just above the effective range of light anti aircraft guns  and just below the optimum engagement height of heavier guns  The altitude and speed were more than the rate of traverse of the standard British QF 3 7 inch mobile gun could cope with  and faster traversing static gun emplacements had to be built at great cost   The development of the proximity fuze and of centimetric  3 gigahertz frequency gun laying radars based on the cavity magnetron helped to counter the V 1 s high speed and small size  In 1944  Bell Labs started delivery of an anti aircraft predictor fire control system based on an analog computer  just in time for the Allied invasion of Europe   These electronic aids arrived in quantity from June 1944  just as the guns reached their firing positions on the coast  Seventeen percent of all flying bombs entering the coastal  gun belt  were destroyed by guns in their first week on the coast  This rose to 60% by 23 August and 74% in the last week of the month  when on one day 82% were shot down  The rate improved from one V 1 destroyed for every 2 500 shells fired initially  to one for every 100  This still did not end the threat  V 1 attacks continued until all launch sites were captured by ground forces   6 2  Barrage balloons  Eventually some 2 000 barrage balloons were deployed  in the hope that V 1s would be destroyed when they struck the balloons  tethering cables  The leading edges of the V 1 s wings were fitted with cable cutters  and fewer than 300 V 1s are known to have been brought down by barrage balloons   6 3  Interceptors  The Defence Committee expressed some doubt as to the ability of the Royal Observer Corps to adequately deal with this new threat  but the ROC s Commandant Air Commodore Finlay Crerar assured the committee that the ROC could again rise to the occasion and prove its alertness and flexibility  He oversaw plans for handling the new threat  codenamed by the RAF and ROC as  Operation Totter    Observers at the coast post of Dymchurch identified the very first of these weapons and within seconds of their report the anti aircraft defences were in action  This new weapon gave the ROC much additional work both at posts and operations rooms  Eventually RAF controllers actually took their radio equipment to the two closest ROC operations rooms at Horsham and Maidstone  and vectored fighters direct from the ROC s plotting tables  The critics who had said that the Corps would be unable to handle the fast flying jet aircraft were answered when these aircraft on their first operation were actually controlled entirely by using ROC information both on the coast and at inland   The average speed of V 1s was and their average altitude was to   Fighter aircraft required excellent low altitude performance to intercept them and enough firepower to ensure that they were destroyed in the air rather than crashing to earth and detonating  Most aircraft were too slow to catch a V 1 unless they had a height advantage  allowing them to gain speed by diving on their target   When V 1 attacks began in mid June 1944  the only aircraft with the low altitude speed to be effective against it was the Hawker Tempest  Fewer than 30 Tempests were available  They were assigned to No  150 Wing RAF  Early attempts to intercept and destroy V 1s often failed  but improved techniques soon emerged  These included using the airflow over an interceptor s wing to raise one wing of the V 1  by sliding the wingtip to within of the lower surface of the V 1 s wing  If properly executed  this manoeuvre would tip the V 1 s wing up  overriding the gyros and sending the V 1 into an out of control dive  At least sixteen V 1s were destroyed this way  a P 51 piloted by Major R  E  Turner of 356th Fighter Squadron being the first on 18 June   It could be seen that the aerodynamic flip method was actually effective when V 1s could be seen over southern parts of the Netherlands headed due eastwards at low altitude  the engine quenched  In early 1945 such a missile soared below clouds over Tilburg to gently alight eastwards of the city in open fields   The Tempest fleet was built up to over 100 aircraft by September  Also  North American P 51 Mustangs and Griffon engined Supermarine Spitfire Mk XIVs were tuned to make them almost fast enough  and during the short summer nights the Tempests shared defensive duty with de Havilland Mosquitoes  There was no need for airborne radar  at night the V 1 s engine could be heard from away or more  and the exhaust plume was visible from a long distance  Wing Commander Roland Beamont had the 20 mm cannon on his Tempest adjusted to converge at ahead  This was so successful that all other aircraft in 150 Wing were thus modified   The anti V 1 sorties by fighters were known as  Diver patrols   after  Diver   the codename used by the Royal Observer Corps for V 1 sightings   Attacking a V 1 was dangerous  machine guns had little effect on the V 1 s sheet steel structure  and if a cannon shell detonated the warhead  the explosion could destroy the attacker   In daylight  V 1 chases were chaotic and often unsuccessful until a special defence zone was declared between London and the coast  in which only the fastest fighters were permitted  The first interception of a V 1 was by F L JG Musgrave with a No  605 Squadron RAF Mosquito night fighter on the night of 14 15 June 1944  Between June and 5 September 1944  a handful of 150 Wing Tempests shot down 638 flying bombs  with No  3 Squadron RAF alone claiming 305  One Tempest pilot  Squadron Leader Joseph Berry  501 Squadron   shot down 59 V 1s  the Belgian ace Squadron Leader Remy Van Lierde  164 Squadron  destroyed 44  with a further nine shared  and W C Roland Beamont  see above  destroyed 31   The next most successful interceptors were the Mosquito  623 victories   Spitfire XIV  303   and Mustang  232   All other types combined added 158  Even though it was not fully operational  the jet powered Gloster Meteor was rushed into service with No  616 Squadron RAF to fight the V 1s  It had ample speed but its cannon were prone to jamming  and it shot down only 13 V 1s   In late 1944 a radar equipped Vickers Wellington bomber was modified for use by the RAF s Fighter Interception Unit as an Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft  Flying at an altitude of over the North Sea  it directed Mosquito fighters charged with intercepting He 111s from Dutch airbases that sought to launch V 1s from the air   6 4  Disposal  The first bomb disposal officer to defuse an unexploded V1 flying bomb was John Pilkington Hudson in 1944   6 5  Deception  To adjust and correct settings in the V 1 guidance system  the Germans needed to know where the V 1s were landing  Therefore  German intelligence was requested to obtain this impact data from their agents in Britain  However  most German agents in Britain had been turned  and were acting as double agents under British control   On 16 June 1944  British double agent Garbo  Juan Pujol  was requested by his German controllers to give information on the sites and times of V 1 impacts  with similar requests made to the other German agents in Britain  Brutus  Roman Czerniawski  and Tate  Wulf Schmidt   If given this data  the Germans would be able to adjust their aim and correct any shortfall  However  there was no plausible reason why the double agents could not supply accurate data  the impacts would be common knowledge amongst Londoners and very likely reported in the press  which the Germans had ready access to through the neutral nations  In addition  as John Cecil Masterman  chairman of the Twenty Committee  commented   If  for example  St Paul s Cathedral were hit  it was useless and harmful to report that the bomb had descended upon a cinema in Islington  since the truth would inevitably get through to Germany       While the British decided how to react  Pujol played for time  On 18 June it was decided that the double agents would report the damage caused by V 1s fairly accurately and minimise the effect they had on civilian morale  It was also decided that Pujol should avoid giving the times of impacts  and should mostly report on those which occurred in the north west of London  to give the impression to the Germans that they were overshooting the target area   While Pujol downplayed the extent of V 1 damage  trouble came from Ostro  an Abwehr agent in Lisbon who pretended to have agents reporting from London  He told the Germans that London had been devastated and had been mostly evacuated due to enormous casualties  The Germans could not perform aerial reconnaissance of London  and believed his damage reports in preference to Pujol s  They thought that the Allies would make every effort to destroy the V 1 launch sites in France  They also accepted Ostros impact reports  Due to Ultra however  the Allies read his messages and adjusted for them   A certain number of the V 1s fired had been fitted with radio transmitters  which had clearly demonstrated a tendency for the V 1 to fall short  Oberst Max Wachtel  commander of Flak Regiment 155 W   which was responsible for the V 1 offensive  compared the data gathered by the transmitters with the reports obtained through the double agents  He concluded  when faced with the discrepancy between the two sets of data  that there must be a fault with the radio transmitters  as he had been assured that the agents were completely reliable  It was later calculated that if Wachtel had disregarded the agents  reports and relied on the radio data  he would have made the correct adjustments to the V 1 s guidance  and casualties might have increased by 50% or more   The policy of diverting V 1 impacts away from central London was initially controversial  The War Cabinet refused to authorise a measure which would increase casualties in any area  even if it reduced casualties elsewhere by greater amounts  It was thought that Churchill would reverse this decision later  he was then away at a conference   but the delay in starting the reports to Germans might be fatal to the deception  So Sir Findlater Stewart of Home Defence Executive took responsibility for starting the deception programme immediately  His action was approved by Churchill when he returned   7  End of the V 1 attacks  By September 1944  the V 1 threat to England was temporarily halted when the launch sites on the French coast were overrun by the advancing Allied armies  4 261 V 1s had been destroyed by fighters  anti aircraft fire and barrage balloons  The last enemy action of any kind on British soil occurred on 29 March 1945  when a V 1 struck Datchworth in Hertfordshire   8  Assessment  Unlike the V 2  the V 1 was a cost effective weapon for the Germans as it forced the Allies to spend heavily on defensive measures and divert bombers from other targets  More than 25% of Combined Bomber Offensive s bombs in July and August 1944 were used against V weapon sites  often ineffectively  In early December 1944  American General Clayton Bissell wrote a paper which argued strongly in favour of the V 1 compared to conventional bombers   The following is a table he produced   The statistic of this report  however  have been the subject of some dispute  The V 1 missiles were often prone to exploding prematurely  occasionally resulting in the loss of the aircraft from which they were dropped  The Luftwaffe lost 77 aircraft as a result of the launch of these sorties   9  Japanese developments  In 1943  an Argus pulse jet engine was shipped to Japan by German submarine  The Aeronautical Institute of Tokyo Imperial University and the Kawanishi Aircraft Company conducted a joint study of the feasibility of mounting a similar engine on a piloted plane  The resulting design was named Baika   plum blossom   but bore no more than a superficial resemblance to the Fi 103  Baika never left the design stage but technical drawings and notes suggest that several versions were considered  an air launched version with the engine under the fuselage  a ground launched version that could take off without a ramp and a submarine launched version with the engine moved forwards   10  Post war  After the war  the armed forces of France  the Soviet Union and the United States experimented with the V 1   10 1  France  The French produced copies of the V 1 for use as target drones  These were called the CT 10 and were smaller than the V 1 with twin tail surfaces  The CT 10 could be ground launched using a rocket booster or from an aircraft  Some CT 10s were sold to the UK and the US   10 2  Soviet Union  The Soviet Union captured V 1s when they overran the Blizna test range in Poland  as well as from the Mittelwerk  The 10Kh was their copy of the V 1  later called Izdeliye 10  Initial tests began in March 1945 at a test range in Tashkent  with further launches from ground sites and from aircraft of improved versions continuing into the late 1940s  The inaccuracy of the guidance system compared to new methods such as beam riding and TV guidance saw development end in the early 1950s   The Soviets also worked on a piloted attack aircraft based on the Argus pulse jet engine of the V 1 which began as a German project  the Junkers EF 126 Lilli  in the latter stages of the war  The Soviet development of the Lilli ended in 1946 after a crash that killed the test pilot   10 3  United States  The United States reverse engineered the V 1 in 1944 from salvaged parts recovered in England during June  By 8 September  the first of thirteen complete prototype Republic Ford JB 2 Loons  were assembled at Republic Aviation  The United States JB 2 was different from the German V 1 in only the smallest of dimensions  The wing span was only wider and the length was extended less than   The difference gave the JB 2 of wing area versus for the V 1   A navalized version  designated KGW 1  was developed to be launched from LSTs  Landing Ship  Tank  as well as escort carriers  CVEs  and long range 4 engine reconnaissance aircraft  Waterproof carriers
