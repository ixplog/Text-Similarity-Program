Pioneer 11  also known as Pioneer G  is a 259 kilogram  569 lb  robotic space probe launched by NASA on April 6  1973 to study the asteroid belt  the environment around Jupiter and Saturn  solar wind  cosmic rays  and eventually the far reaches of the solar system and heliosphere  It was the first probe to encounter Saturn and the second to fly through the asteroid belt and by Jupiter  Due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe  last contact with the spacecraft was on September 30  1995   1  Mission background  1 1  History  Approved in February 1969  Pioneer 11 and its twin probe Pioneer 10 were the first to be designed for exploring the outer solar system  Yielding to multiple proposals throughout the 1960s  early mission objectives were defined as   Explore the interplanetary medium beyond the orbit of Mars  Investigate the nature of the asteroid belt from the scientific standpoint and assess the belt s possible hazard to missions to the outer planets   Explore the environment of Jupiter  Subsequent planning for an encounter with Saturn added many more goals   Map the magnetic field of Saturn and determine its intensity  direction  and structure   Determine how many electrons and protons of various energies are distributed along the trajectory of the spacecraft through the Saturn system   Map the interaction of the Saturn system with the solar wind   Measure the temperature of Saturn s atmosphere and that of Titan  the largest satellite of Saturn   Determine the structure of the upper atmosphere of Saturn where molecules are expected to be electrically charged and form an ionosphere   Map the thermal structure of Saturn s atmosphere by infrared observations coupled with radio occultation data   Obtain spin scan images of the Saturnian system in two colors during the encounter sequence and polarimetry measurements of the planet   Probe the ring system and the atmosphere of Saturn with S band radio occultation   Determine more precisely the masses of Saturn and its larger satellites by accurate observations of the effects of their gravitational fields on the motion of the spacecraft   As a precursor to the Mariner Jupiter Saturn mission  verify the environment of the ring plane to find out where it may be safely crossed by the Mariner spacecraft without serious damage  Pioneer 11 was built by TRW and managed as part of the Pioneer program by NASA Ames Research Center  A backup unit  Pioneer H  is currently on display in the  Milestones of Flight  exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington  D C   Many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the Voyager Program   1 2  Spacecraft design  The Pioneer 11 bus measured 36 centimeters deep and with six 76 centimeters long panels forming the hexagonal structure  The bus housed propellant to control the orientation of the probe and eight of the twelve scientific instruments  The spacecraft had a mass of 260 kilograms   1 2 1

on April 6  1973 at 02 11 00 UTC  by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from Space Launch Complex 36A at Cape Canaveral  Florida aboard an Atlas Centaur launch vehicle  Its twin probe  Pioneer 10  had launched a year earlier on March 3  1972  Pioneer 11 was launched on a trajectory directly aimed at Jupiter without any prior gravitational assists   2 2  Encounter with Jupiter  Pioneer 11 flew past Jupiter in November and December 1974  During its closest approach  on December 2  Pioneer 11 passed above the cloud tops  The probe obtained detailed images of the Great Red Spot  transmitted the first images of the immense polar regions  and determined the mass of Jupiter s moon Callisto  Using the gravitational pull of Jupiter  a gravity assist was used to alter the trajectory of the probe towards Saturn   2 3  Saturn encounter  Pioneer 11 passed by Saturn on September 1  1979  at a distance of 21 000 km from Saturn s cloud tops   By this time Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 had already passed Jupiter and were also en route to Saturn  so it was decided to target Pioneer 11 to pass through the Saturn ring plane at the same position that the soon to come Voyager probes would use in order to test the route before the Voyagers arrived  If there were faint ring particles that could damage a probe in that area  mission planners felt it was better to learn about it via Pioneer  Thus  Pioneer 11 was acting as a  pioneer  in a true sense of the word  if danger was detected  then the Voyager probes could be rerouted further away from the rings  but missing the opportunity to visit Uranus and Neptune in the process   Pioneer 11 imaged and nearly collided with one of Saturn s small moons  passing at a distance of no more than   The object was tentatively identified as Epimetheus  a moon discovered the previous day from Pioneer s imaging  and suspected from earlier observations by Earth based telescopes  After the Voyager flybys  it became known that there are two similarly sized moons  Epimetheus and Janus  in the same orbit  so there is some uncertainty about which one was the object of Pioneer s near miss  Pioneer 11 encountered Janus on September 1  1979 at 14 52 UTC at a distance of 2500 km and Mimas at 16 20 UTC the same day at 103000 km   Besides Epimetheus  instruments located another previously undiscovered small moon and an additional ring  charted Saturn s magnetosphere and magnetic field and found its planet size moon  Titan  to be too cold for life  Hurtling underneath the ring plane  Pioneer 11 sent back pictures of Saturn s rings  The rings  which normally seem bright when observed from Earth  appeared dark in the Pioneer pictures  and the dark gaps in the rings seen from Earth appeared as bright rings   2 4  Interstellar mission  2 4 1  Pioneer anomaly  Analysis of the radio tracking data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft at distances between 20–70 AU from the Sun has consistently indicated the presence of a small but anomalous Doppler frequency drift  The drift can be interpreted as due to a constant acceleration of directed towards the Sun  Although it is suspected that there is a systematic origin to the effect  none was found  As a result  there is sustained interest in the nature of this so called  Pioneer anomaly   Extended analysis of mission data by Slava Turyshev and colleagues has determined the source of the anomaly to be asymmetric thermal radiation and the resulting thermal recoil force acting on the face of the Pioneers away from the Sun  and in July 2012 the group of researchers published their results in a scientific journal   2 5  NASA ends operations  On September 29  1995  NASA s Ames Research Center  responsible for managing the project  issued a press release that began   After nearly 22 years of exploration out to the farthest reaches of the Solar System  one of the most durable and productive space missions in history will come to a close   It indicated NASA would use its Deep Space Network antennas to listen  once or twice a month  for the spacecraft s signal  until  some time in late 1996  when  its transmitter will fall silent altogether   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin characterized Pioneer 11 as  the little spacecraft that could  a venerable explorer that has taught us a great deal about the Solar System and  in the end  about our own innate drive to learn  Pioneer 11 is what NASA is all about 舑 exploration beyond the frontier   Besides announcing the end of operations  the dispatch provided a historical list of Pioneer 11 mission achievements   3  Current status  On September 9  2012  Pioneer 11 was from the Earth and from the Sun  and traveling at  relative to the Sun  and traveling outward at about 2 400 AU per year  Sunlight takes 11 92 hours to get to Pioneer 11  The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft is magnitude  17 0  Pioneer 11 is heading in the direction of the constellation Scutum   Pioneer 11 has now been overtaken by the two Voyager probes  launched in 1977  and Voyager 1 is now the most distant object built by humans   3 1  Pioneer plaque  Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 carry a gold anodized aluminum plaque in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by intelligent lifeforms from other planetary systems  The plaques feature the nude figures of a human male and female along with several symbols that are designed to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft   4  See also  Cassini–Huygens  New Horizons  Pioneer 10  S band  Unmanned space missions
