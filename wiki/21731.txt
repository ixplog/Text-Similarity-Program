A nursery rhyme is a traditional poem or song for young children in Britain and many other countries  but usage only dates from the late 18th early 19th century and in North America the term Mother Goose Rhymes  introduced in the mid 1700s  is still often used   1  History  1 1  Lullabies  The oldest children s songs of which we have records are lullabies  intended to help a child sleep  Lullabies can be found in every human culture  The English term lullaby is thought to come from  lu  lu  or  la la  sound made by mothers or nurses to calm children  and    or  bye bye   either another lulling sound  or a term for good night  Until the modern era lullabies were usually only recorded incidentally in written sources  The Roman nurses  lullaby   Lalla  Lalla  Lalla  aut dormi  aut lacta   is recorded in a scholium on Persius and may be the oldest to survive   Many medieval English verses associated with the birth of Jesus take the form of a lullaby  including  Lullay  my liking  my dere son  my sweting  and may be versions of contemporary lullabies  However  most of those used today date from the 17th century  For example  a well known lullaby such as  Rock a bye  baby on a tree top   cannot be found in records until the late 18th century when it was printed by John Newbery  c  1765    1 2  Early nursery rhymes  A French poem  similar to  Thirty days hath September   numbering the days of the month  was recorded in the 13th century  From the later Middle Ages there are records of short children s rhyming songs  often as marginalia  From the mid 16th century they begin to be recorded in English plays  Most nursery rhymes were not written down until the 18th century  when the publishing of children s books began to move from polemic and education towards entertainment  but there is evidence for many rhymes existing before this  including  To market  to market  and  Cock a doodle doo   which date from at least the late 16th century   The first English collections  Tommy Thumb s Song Book and a sequel  Tommy Thumb s Pretty Song Book  are both thought to have been published before 1744  with such songs becoming known as  Tommy Thumb s songs   The publication of John Newbery s compilation of English rhymes  Mother Goose s Melody  or  Sonnets for the Cradle  London  c 1765   is the first record we have of many classic rhymes  still in use today  These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources  including traditional riddles  proverbs  ballads  lines of Mummers  plays  drinking songs  historical events  and  it has been suggested  ancient pagan rituals  About half of the currently recognised  traditional  English rhymes were known by the mid 18th century   1 3  19th century  In the early 19th century printed collections of rhymes began to spread to other countries  including Robert Chambers s Popular Rhymes of Scotland  1826  and in the United States  Mother Goose s Melodies  1833   From this period we sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes—for instance  in  Twinkle Twinkle Little Star  which combines the melody of an 18th century French tune  Ah vous dirai je  Maman  with a 19th century English poem by Jane Taylor entitled  The Star  used as lyrics  Early folk song collectors also often collected  what were now known as  nursery rhymes  including in Scotland Sir Walter Scott and in Germany Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim in Des Knaben Wunderhorn  1806–1808   The first  and possibly the most important academic collection to focus in this area was James Orchard Halliwell s  The Nursery Rhymes of England  1842  and Popular Rhymes and Tales in 1849  in which he divided rhymes into antiquities  historical   fireside stories  game rhymes  alphabet rhymes  riddles  nature rhymes  places and families  proverbs  superstitions  customs  and nursery songs  lullabies   By the time of Sabine Baring Gould s A Book of Nursery Songs  1895   folklore was an academic study  full of comments and foot notes  A professional anthropologist  Andrew Lang  1844–1912  produced The Nursery Rhyme Book in 1897  The early years of the 20th century are notable for the illustrations to children s books including Caldecott s Hey Diddle Diddle Picture Book  1909  and Arthur Rackham s Mother Goose  1913   The definitive study of English rhymes remains the work of Iona and Peter Opie   2  Meanings of nursery rhymes  Many nursery rhymes have been argued to have hidden meanings and origins  John Bellenden Ker   1765–1842   for example  wrote four volumes arguing that English nursery rhymes were actually written in  Low Saxon   a hypothetical early form of Dutch  He then  translated  them back into English  revealing in particular a strong tendency to anti clericalism  Many of the ideas about the links between rhymes and historical persons  or events  can be traced back to Katherine Elwes s book The Real Personages of Mother Goose  1930   in which she linked famous nursery rhyme characters with real people  on little or no evidence  She assumed that children s songs were a peculiar form of coded historical narrative  propaganda or covert protest  and rarely considered that they could have been written simply for entertainment   3  Nursery rhyme revisionism  There have been several attempts  across the world  to revise nursery rhymes  along with fairy tales and popular songs   Even in the late 18th century we can sometimes see how rhymes like  Little Robin Redbreast  were cleaned up for a young audience  In the late 19th century the major concern seems to have been violence and crime  which led leading children s publishers in the United States like Jacob Abbot and Samuel Goodrich to  improve  mother goose rhymes   In the early and mid 20th centuries this was a form of bowdlerisation  concerned with some of the more violent elements of nursery rhymes and led to the formation of organisations like the British  Society for Nursery Rhyme Reform   Psychoanalysts such as Bruno Bettelheim strongly criticized this revisionism  on the grounds that it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues and it has been argued that revised versions may not perform the functions of catharsis for children  or allow them to imaginatively deal with violence and danger   In the late 20th century revisionism of nursery rhymes became associated with the idea of political correctness  Most attempts to reform nursery rhymes on this basis appear to be either very small scale  light hearted updating  like Felix Dennis  When Jack Sued Jill – Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times  2006   or satires written as if from the point of view of political correctness in order to condemn reform  The controversy over changing the language of  Baa Baa Black Sheep  in Britain from 1986  because  it was alleged in the popular press  it was seen as racially dubious  was apparently based only on a rewriting of the rhyme in one private nursery  as an exercise for the children   4  Nursery rhymes and education  It has been argued that nursery rhymes set to music aid in a child s development  Research also supports the assertion that music and rhyme increase a child s ability in spatial reasoning  which leads to greater success in school in the subjects of mathematics and science   5  See also  Children s song
