Lucius Tarquinius Priscus  or Tarquin the Elder  was the legendary fifth king of Rome from 616 to 579 BC  His wife was Tanaquil   1  Early life  According to Livy  Tarquin came from Etruria  Livy claims that his original Etruscan name was Lucumo  but since Lucumo  Etruscan Lauchume  is the Etruscan word for  King   there is reason to believe that Priscus  name and title have been confused in the official tradition  After inheriting his father s entire fortune  Lucius attempted to gain a political office  Disgruntled with his opportunities in Etruria  he had been prohibited from obtaining political office in Tarquinii because of the ethnicity of his father  Demaratus  who came from the Greek city of Corinth   he migrated to Rome with his wife Tanaquil  at her suggestion  Legend has it that on his arrival in Rome in a chariot  an eagle took his cap  flew away and then returned it back upon his head  Tanaquil  who was skilled in prophecy  interpreted this as an omen of his future greatness  In Rome  he attained respect through his courtesy  The king himself noticed Tarquinius and  by his will  appointed Tarquinius guardian of his own sons   2  King of Rome  Although Ancus Marcius  the Roman king  was the grandson of Numa Pompilius  the second King of Rome  the principle of hereditary monarchy was not yet established at Rome  none of the first three kings had been succeeded by their sons  and each subsequent king had been acclaimed by the people  Upon the death of Marcius  Tarquin addressed the Comitia Curiata and convinced them that he should be elected king over Marcius  natural sons  who were still only youths  In one tradition  the sons were away on a hunting expedition at the time of their father s death  and were thus unable to affect the assembly s choice   According to Livy  Tarquin increased the number of the Senate by adding one hundred men from the leading minor families  Among these was the family of the Octavii  from whom first emperor  Augustus  was descended   Tarquin s first war was waged against the Latins  Tarquinius took the Latin town of Apiolae by storm and took great booty from there back to Rome  According to the Fasti Triumphales  this war must have occurred prior to 588 BC   His military ability was then tested by an attack from the Sabines  who received auxiliaries from five Etruscan cities  Tarquin doubled the numbers of equites to help the war effort  The Sabines were defeated after difficult street fighting in the city of Rome  In the peace negotiations that followed  Tarquin received the town of Collatia  and appointed his nephew  Arruns Tarquinius  better known as Egerius  as commander of the garrison there  Tarquin returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph on September 13  585 BC   Subsequently  the Latin cities of Corniculum  old Ficulea  Cameria  Crustumerium  Ameriola  Medullia and Nomentum were subdued and became Roman   Since Tarquin had kept the captured Etruscan auxiliaries prisoners for meddling in the war with the Sabines  the five Etruscan cities who had taken part declared war on Rome  Seven other Etruscan cities joined forces with them  The Etruscans soon captured the Roman colony at Fidenae  which thereupon became the focal point of the war  After several bloody battles  Tarquin was once again victorious  and he subjugated the Etruscan cities who had taken part in the war  At the successful conclusion of each of his wars  Rome was enriched by Tarquin s plunder   Tarquin is said to have built the Circus Maximus  the first and largest stadium at Rome  for chariot racing  Raised seating was erected privately by the senators and equites  and other areas were marked out for private citizens  There the king established a series of annual games  according to Livy  the first horses and boxers to participate were brought from Etruria   After a great flood  Tarquin drained the damp lowlands of Rome by constructing the Cloaca Maxima  Rome s great sewer  He also constructed a stone wall around the city  and began the construction of a temple in honour of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill  The latter is said to have been funded in part by the plunder seized from the Sabines   Many of the Roman symbols both of war and of civil office date from his reign  and he was the first to celebrate a triumph  after the Etruscan fashion  wearing a robe of purple and gold  and borne on a chariot drawn by four horses   3  Death and succession  Tarquin is said to have reigned for thirty eight years  According to legend  the sons of his predecessor  Ancus Marcius  believed that the throne should have been theirs  They arranged the king s assassination  disguised as a riot  during which Tarquin received a fatal blow to the head  However  the queen  Tanaquil  gave out that the king was merely wounded  and took advantage of the confusion to establish Servius Tullius as regent  when the death of Tarquin was confirmed  Tullius became king  in place of Marcius  sons  or those of Tarquin   Tullius  said to have been the son of Servius Tullius  a prince of Corniculum who had fallen in battle against Tarquin  was brought to the palace as a child with his mother  Ocreisia  According to legend  Tanaquil discovered his potential for greatness by means of various omens  and therefore preferred him to her own sons  He married Tarquinia  the king s daughter  thus providing a vital link between the families  Tullius  own daughters were subsequently married to the king s sons  or  in some traditions  grandsons   Lucius and Arruns   Most ancient writers regarded Tarquin as the father of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus  the seventh and last King of Rome  but some stated that the younger Tarquin was his grandson  As the younger Tarquin died about 496 BC  more than eighty years after Tarquinius Priscus  chronology seems to support the latter tradition  An Etruscan legend related by the emperor Claudius equates Servius Tullius with Macstarna  apparently the Etruscan equivalent of the Latin magister   a companion of the Etruscan heroes Aulus and Caelius Vibenna  who helped free the brothers from captivity  slaying their captors  including a Roman named Gnaeus Tarquinius  This episode is depicted in a fresco at the tomb of the Etruscan Saties family at Vulci  now known as the Fran√ßois Tomb  This tradition suggests that perhaps the sons of the elder Tarquin attempted to seize power  but were defeated by the regent  Servius Tullius  and his companions  Tullius would then have attempted to end the dynastic struggle by marrying his daughters to the grandsons of Tarquinius Priscus  However  this plan ultimately failed  as Tullius was himself assassinated at the instigation of his son in law  who succeeded him   4  Notes  5
