Human spaceflight  also referred to as manned spaceflight  is space travel with a crew aboard the spacecraft  When a spacecraft is crewed  it can be operated directly  as opposed to being remotely operated or autonomous   The first human spaceflight was launched by the Soviet Union on 12 April 1961 as a part of the Vostok program  with cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard  Humans have been continually present in space for on the International Space Station   Since the retirement of the US Space Shuttle in 2011  only Russia and China have maintained domestic human spaceflight capability with the Soyuz program and Shenzhou program  Currently  all crewed flights to the International Space Station use Soyuz vehicles  which remain attached to the station to allow quick return if needed  The United States is developing commercial crew transportation to facilitate domestic access to ISS and low Earth orbit  as well as the Orion vehicle for beyond low Earth orbit applications   While spaceflight has typically been a government directed activity  commercial spaceflight has gradually been taking on a greater role  The first private human spaceflight took place on 21 June 2004  when SpaceShipOne conducted a suborbital flight  and a number of non governmental companies have been working to develop a space tourism industry  NASA has also played a role to stimulate private spaceflight through programs such as Commercial Orbital Transportation Services  COTS  and Commercial Crew Development  CCDev   With its 2011 budget proposals released in 2010  the Obama administration moved towards a model where commercial companies would supply NASA with transportation services of both crew and cargo to low Earth orbit  The vehicles used for these services could then serve both NASA and potential commercial customers  Commercial resupply of ISS began two years after the retirement of the Shuttle  and commercial crew launches could begin by 2017   1  History  1 1  First human spaceflights  The first human spaceflight took place on 12 April 1961  when cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin made one orbit around the Earth aboard the Vostok 1 spacecraft  launched by the Soviet space program  Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space aboard Vostok 6 on 16 June 1963  Both spacecraft were launched by Vostok 3KA launch vehicles  Alexei Leonov made the first spacewalk when he left Voskhod 2 on 8 March 1965  Svetlana Savitskaya became the first woman to do so on 25 July 1984   The United States became the second nation to put a human in space with the suborbital flight of astronaut Alan Shepard aboard Freedom 7 as part of Project Mercury  The spacecraft was launched on 5 May 1961 on a Redstone rocket  The first U S  orbital flight was that of John Glenn aboard Friendship 7  launched 20 February 1962 on an Atlas rocket  From 1981 to 2011  the U S  conducted all its human spaceflight missions with reusable space shuttles  Sally Ride became the first American woman in space in 1983  Eileen Collins was the first female shuttle pilot  and with shuttle mission STS 93 in 1999 she became the first woman to command a U S  spacecraft   China became the third nation to achieve independent human spaceflight capability when Yang Liwei launched into space on a Chinese made vehicle  the Shenzhou 5  on 15 October 2003  The first Chinese woman  Liu Yang  was launched in June 2012 aboard Shenzhou 9  Previous European  Hermes  and Japanese  HOPE X  domestic human spaceflight programs were abandoned after years of development  as was the first Chinese attempt  the Shuguang spacecraft   The farthest destination for a human spaceflight mission has been the Moon  The only manned missions to the Moon have been those conducted by NASA as part of the Apollo program  The first such mission  Apollo 8  orbited the Moon but did not land  The first Moon landing mission was Apollo 11  during which—on 20 July 1969—Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first people to set foot on the Moon  Six missions landed in total  numbered Apollo 11–17  excluding Apollo 13  Altogether 12 men walked on the Moon  the only humans to have been on an extraterrestrial body  The Soviet Union discontinued its program for lunar orbiting and landing of human spaceflight missions in 1974 when Valentin Glushko became General Designer of NPO Energiya   The longest single human spaceflight is that of Valeriy Polyakov  who left Earth on 8 January 1994  and did not return until 22 March 1995  a total of 437 days 17 hr  58 min  16 sec    Sergei Krikalyov has spent the most time of anyone in space  803 days  9 hours  and 39 minutes altogether  The longest period of continuous human presence in space is on the International Space Station  exceeding the previous record of almost 10 years  or 3 634 days  held by Mir  spanning the launch of Soyuz TM 8 on 5 September 1989 to the landing of Soyuz TM 29 on 28 August 1999   For many years beginning in 1961  only two countries  the USSR  later Russia  and the United States  had their own astronauts  Citizens of other nations flew in space  beginning with the flight of Vladimir Remek  a Czech  on a Soviet spacecraft on 2 March 1978    citizens from 38 nations  including space tourists  have flown in space aboard Soviet  American  Russian  and Chinese spacecraft   1 2  Post shuttle gap in United States human spaceflight capability  Under the Bush administration  the Constellation Program included plans for retiring the Shuttle program and replacing it with the capability for spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit  In the 2011 United States federal budget  the Obama administration cancelled Constellation for being over budget and behind schedule while not innovating and investing in critical new technologies  For beyond low earth orbit human spaceflight NASA is developing the Orion spacecraft to be launched by the Space Launch System  Under the Commercial Crew Development plan  NASA will rely on transportation services provided by the private sector to reach low earth orbit  such as Space X s Falcon 9 Dragon V2  Sierra Nevada Corporation s Dream Chaser  or Boeing s CST 100  The period between the retirement of the shuttle in 2011 and the initial operational capability of new systems in 2017  similar to the gap between the end of Apollo in 1975 and the first space shuttle flight in 1981  is referred to by a presidential Blue Ribbon Committee as the U S  human spaceflight gap  Commercial sub orbital spacecraft aimed at the space tourism market such as Scaled Composites SpaceshipTwo to be operated by Virgin Galactic  and XCOR s Lynx spaceplane are under development and could reach space in 2014   2  Space programs  Human spaceflight programs have been conducted by the former Soviet Union Russian Federation  the United States  the People s Republic of China and by private spaceflight company Scaled Composites   The Indian Space Research Organization  ISRO  begun work on pre project activities of human space flight mission programme  The objective of Human Spaceflight Programme is to undertake a human spaceflight mission to carry a crew of two to Low Earth Orbit  LEO  and return them safely to a predefined destination on earth  The programme is proposed to be implemented in defined phases  Currently  the pre project activities are progressing with a focus on the development of critical technologies for subsystems such as Crew Module  CM   Environmental control and Life Support System  ECLSS   Crew Escape System  etc  A study for undertaking human space flight to carry human beings to low earth orbit and ensure their safe return has been made by the department  The department has initiated pre project activities to study technical and managerial issues related to undertaking manned mission with an aim to build and demonstrate the country’s capability  The programme envisages the development of a fully autonomous orbital vehicle carrying 2 or 3 crew members to about 300 km low earth orbit and their safe return   Several other countries and space agencies have announced and begun human spaceflight programs by their own technology  Japan  JAXA   Iran  ISA  and Malaysia  MNSA    Currently the following spacecraft and spaceports are used for launching human spaceflights   Soyuz with Soyuz rocket—Baikonur Cosmodrome  International Space Station  ISS —Assembled in orbit  crews transported by Soyuz spacecraft  Shenzhou spacecraft with Long March rocket—Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center  Tiangong 1—crews transported by Shenzhou spacecraft Historically  the following spacecraft and spaceports have also been used for human spaceflight launches   Vostok—Baikonur Cosmodrome  Mercury—Cape Canaveral Air Force Station  Voskhod—Baikonur Cosmodrome  X 15—Edwards Air Force Base   two internationally recognized suborbital flights in program   Gemini—Cape Canaveral Air Force Station  Apollo—Kennedy Space Center  Apollo 7 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station   Salyut space station—Baikonur Cosmodrome  Almaz space station—Baikonur Cosmodrome  Almaz was a series of military space stations under cover of the civilian name Salyut   Skylab space station—Kennedy Space Center  Mir space station—Baikonur Cosmodrome  SpaceShipOne with White Knight—Mojave Spaceport  Space Shuttle—Kennedy Space Center Numerous private companies attempted human spaceflight programs in an effort to win the $10 million Ansari X Prize  The first private human spaceflight took place on 21 June 2004  when SpaceShipOne conducted a suborbital flight  SpaceShipOne captured the prize on 4 October 2004  when it accomplished two consecutive flights within one week  SpaceShipTwo  launching from the carrier aircraft White Knight Two  is planned to conduct regular suborbital space tourism   Most of the time  the only humans in space are those aboard the ISS  whose crew of six spends up to six months at a time in low Earth orbit   NASA and ESA use the term  human spaceflight  to refer to their programs of launching people into space  These endeavors have also been referred to as  manned space missions    3  National spacefaring attempts  4  Safety concerns  Planners of human spaceflight missions face a number of safety concerns   4 1  Life support  The immediate needs for breathable air and drinkable water are addressed by the life support system of the spacecraft   4 2  Medical issues  Medical consequences such as possible blindness and bone loss have been associated with human space flight   On 31 December 2012  a NASA supported study reported that spaceflight may harm the brain of astronauts and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer s disease   4 2 1  Effects of microgravity  Medical data from astronauts in low earth orbits for long periods  dating back to the 1970s  show several adverse effects of a microgravity environment  loss of bone density  decreased muscle strength and endurance  postural instability  and reductions in aerobic capacity  Over time these deconditioning effects can impair astronauts’ performance or increase their risk of injury   In a weightless environment  astronauts put almost no weight on the back muscles or leg muscles used for standing up  Those muscles then start to weaken and eventually get smaller  If there is an emergency at landing  the loss of muscles  and consequently the loss of strength can be a serious problem  Sometimes  astronauts can lose up to 25% of their muscle mass on long term flights  When they get back to ground  they will be considerably weakened and will be out of action for a while   Astronauts experiencing weightlessness will often lose their orientation  get motion sickness  and lose their sense of direction as their bodies try to get used to a weightless environment  When they get back to Earth  or any other mass with gravity  they have to readjust to the gravity and may have problems standing up  focusing their gaze  walking and turning  Importantly  those body motor disturbances after changing from different gravities only get worse the longer the exposure to little gravity  These changes will affect operational activities including approach and landing  docking  remote manipulation  and emergencies that may happen while landing  This can be a major roadblock to mission success   In addition  after long space flight missions  male astronauts may experience severe eyesight problems  Such eyesight problems may be a major concern for future deep space flight missions  including a manned mission to the planet Mars   4 2 2  Radiation  Without proper shielding  the crews of missions beyond low Earth orbit  LEO  might be at risk from high energy protons emitted by solar flares  Lawrence Townsend of the University of Tennessee and others have studied the most powerful solar flare ever recorded  That flare was seen by the British astronomer Richard Carrington in September 1859  Radiation doses astronauts would receive from a Carrington type flare could cause acute radiation sickness and possibly even death   Another type of radiation  galactic cosmic rays  presents further challenges to human spaceflight beyond LEO   4 2 2 1  Radiation damage to the immune system  There is also some scientific concern that extended spaceflight might slow down the body’s ability to protect itself against diseases  Some of the problems are a weakened immune system and the activation of dormant viruses in the body  Radiation can cause both short and long term consequences to the bone marrow stem cells which create the blood and immune systems  Because the interior of a spacecraft is so small  a weakened immune system and more active viruses in the body can lead to a fast spread of infection   4 2 3  Isolation  During long missions  astronauts are isolated and confined into small spaces  Depression  cabin fever and other psychological problems may impact the crew s safety and mission success   Astronauts may not be able to quickly return to Earth or receive medical supplies  equipment or personnel if a medical emergency occurs  The astronauts may have to rely for long periods on their limited existing resources and medical advice from the ground   4 3  Launch safety  4 4  Reentry safety  4 5  Reliability  4 6  Fatality risk    18 crew members have died during actual spaceflight missions  see table   Over 100 others have died in accidents during activity directly related to spaceflight missions or testing   5  See also  List of human spaceflights
