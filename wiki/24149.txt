Pope Clement XIV    31 October 1705 – 22 September 1774   born Giovanni Vincenzo Antonio Ganganelli  reigned from 19 May 1769 to his death in 1774  At the time of his election  he was the only Franciscan friar in the College of Cardinals  To date he is the last pope to take the name  Clement  upon his election   He is best known for his suppression of the Society of Jesus   1  Biography  1 1  Early life  Ganganelli was born in Santarcangelo di Romagna  He received his education from the Jesuits at Rimini and the Piarists of Urbino  and in 1724  at the age of nineteen  entered the Order of Friars Minor Conventual with the name of Lorenzo Francesco  In 1741 he was elected as Definitor General of the order  Ganganelli became a friend of Pope Benedict XIV  1740–58   who in 1758 appointed him to investigate the issue of the traditional blood libel regarding the Jews  which Ganganelli found to be untrue   Pope Clement XIII  1758–69  appointed him Cardinal Priest of San Lorenzo in Panisperna in 1759  at the insistence of Lorenzo Ricci  the General of the Jesuits   1 2  Election to the papacy  1 2 1  Pressures  King Louis XV of France s  1715–74  minister  the duc de Choiseul  had former experience of Rome as French ambassador  and was Europe s most skilled diplomat   When one has a favour to ask of a Pope   he wrote   and one is determined to obtain it  one must ask for two   Choiseul s suggestion  advanced to the other ambassadors  was that they should press  in addition to the Jesuit issue  territorial claims upon the Patrimony of Peter  including the return of Avignon and the Comtat Venaissin to France  the duchies of Benevento and Pontecorvo to Spain  an extension of territory adjoining the Papal States to Naples  and an immediate and final settlement of the vexed question of Parma and Piacenza that had occasioned a diplomatic rift between Austria and Pope Clement XIII   The conclave had been sitting since 15 February 1769  heavily influenced by the political manoeuvres of the ambassadors of Catholic sovereigns who were opposed to the Jesuits  Some of the pressure was subtle  for an unprecedented impromptu visit to the conclave by Emperor Joseph II  1765–90  and his brother Leopold  Grand Duke of Tuscany  officially incognito  the seals were broken  the Austrians inspected the proceedings with great interest and brought with them a festive banquet  During the previous pontificate  the Jesuits had been expelled from Portugal and from all the courts of the House of Bourbon  which included France  Spain  Naples  and Parma  Now the general suppression of the order was urged by the faction called the  court cardinals   who were opposed by the diminished pro Jesuit faction  the Zelanti   zealous    who were generally opposed to the encroaching secularism of the Enlightenment   1 2 2  Election  Cardinal Ganganelli was elected pope on 19 May 1769  largely due to support of the Bourbon courts  which had expected that he would suppress the Society of Jesus  He took the name Clement XIV and was installed on 4 June 1769   1 3  Pontificate  Clement XIV s policies were calculated from the outset to smooth the breaches with the Catholic Crowns that had developed during the previous pontificate  The dispute between the temporal and the spiritual Catholic authorities was perceived as a threat by Church authority  and Clement XIV worked towards reconciliation among the European sovereigns  The arguing and fighting among the monarchs seemed poised to lead Europe towards heavy international competition   By yielding the Papal claims to Parma  Clement obtained the restitution of Avignon and Benevento  and in general he succeeded in placing the relations of the spiritual and the temporal authorities on a friendlier footing  The Pope went on to suppress the Jesuits  writing the decree to this effect in November 1772 and signing it in July 1773   This measure  to late 19th century Catholics  had covered Clement XIV s memory with infamy in his church  and was also quite controversial  with the Catholic Encyclopedia supporting Clement XIV s suppression of the Jesuits as  abundantly justified    His work was hardly accomplished  before Clement XIV  whose usual constitution was quite vigorous  fell into a languishing sickness  generally attributed to poison  No conclusive evidence of poisoning was ever produced  The claims that the Pope was poisoned were denied by those closest to him  and as the Annual Register for 1774 stated  he was over 70 and had been in ill health for some time   Clement XIV died on 22 September 1774  execrated by the Ultramontane party  but widely mourned by his subjects for his popular administration of the Papal States   The Catholic Encyclopedia  or the 1876 Encyclopædia Britannica  says that   Jacques Cretineau Joly  however  wrote a critical history of the Pope s administration   1 3 1  Suppression of the Jesuits  The Jesuits had been expelled from Brazil  1754   Portugal  1759   France  1764   Spain and its colonies  1767  and Parma  1768   Though he had to face strong pressure on the part of the ambassadors of the Bourbon courts Clement XIII always refused to yield to their demands to have the Society of Jesus suppressed  His successor Clement XIV tried to placate the enemies of the Jesuits by treating them harshly  he refused to meet the Superior General  Lorenzo Ricci  ordered them not to receive novices  etc   The pressure kept building up to the point that Catholic countries were threatening to break away from the Church  Clement XIV ultimately yielded  in the name of peace of the Church and to avoid a secession in Europe  and suppressed the Society of Jesus by the brief Dominus ac Redemptor of the 21 July 1773  However in non Catholic nations  particularly in Prussia and Russia  where papal authority was not recognized  the order was ignored  It was a result of a series of political moves rather than a theological controversy   1 3 2  Clement XIV and Mozart  Pope Clement XIV and the customs of the Catholic Church in Rome are described in letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and of his father Leopold Mozart  written from Rome in April and May 1770 during their tour of Italy  Leopold found the upper clergy offensively haughty  but was received  with his son  by the pope  where Wolfgang demonstrated an amazing feat of musical memory  The papal chapel was famous for performing a Miserere mei  Deus by the 17th century composer Gregorio Allegri  whose music was not to be copied outside of the chapel on pain of excommunication  The 14 year old Wolfgang was able to transcribe the composition in its entirety after a single hearing  Clement made young Mozart a knight of the Order of the Golden Spur   1 3 3  Death and burial  The last months of his life were embittered by his failures and he seemed always to be in sorrow because of this  On 10 September 1774  he was bedridden and received Extreme Unction on 21 September 1774  It is said that St  Alphonse Liguori  assisted Clement XlV in his last hours by the gift of bi location   Clement XIV died on September 22  1774  When his body was opened for the autopsy  the doctors ascribed his death to scorbutic and hemorrhoidal dispositions of long standing that were aggravated by excessive labour and the habit of provoking artificial perspiration even in the greatest heat  His Neoclassical style tomb was designed and sculpted by Antonio Canova  and it is found in the church of Santi Apostoli in Rome  To this day  he is best remembered for his suppression of the Jesuits   2  See also  Suppression of the Society of Jesus  Cardinals created by Clement XIV  3  Notes  4  References  Initial text from the 9th edition  1876  of the Encyclopædia
