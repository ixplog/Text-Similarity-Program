The trial and execution of Socrates took place in 399 BC  Socrates was tried on two charges  corrupting the youth and impiety  in Greek  asebeia   More specifically  Socrates  accusers cited two  impious  acts   failing to acknowledge the gods that the city acknowledges  and  introducing new deities   Socrates  death was the result of his asking philosophical questions  A majority of the dikasts  Athenian citizens chosen by lot to serve as jurors  voted to convict him  Consistent with common practice  the dikasts determined Socrates’ punishment with another vote  Socrates was ultimately sentenced to death by drinking a hemlock based liquid  Primary sources for accounts of the trial are given by two of Socrates  friends  Plato and Xenophon  well known later interpretations include those of the journalist I  F  Stone and the classics scholar Robin Waterfield   1  Background  Socrates was a well known figure in Athens for many years prior to his trial  Aristophanes’ comedy The Clouds  produced in 423 BC  portrays Socrates as a sophist  In the play  Socrates teaches young Pheidippides how to formulate arguments to justify beating his own father  Though Socrates denied any affiliation with the sophists  Clouds suggests that Athenians associated him with the sophistic movement  The sophists were a group of mixed reputation in Athens  G B  Kerferd provides an example of one widespread modern view of the sophists  “…they were a set of charlatans that appeared in Greece in the fifth century  and earned ample livelihood by imposing on public credulity  professing to teach virtue  they really taught the art of fallacious discourse  and meanwhile propagated immoral practical doctrines ”  Clouds is not the only Aristophanes comedy which portrays conflict between an older man and his younger counterpart  Aristophanes’ comedy Wasps  422 BC  also contains disagreement between older men and younger men  This  as Robin Waterfield argues  represents the social conflict between two generations of men in Athens  especially in the decade from 425 to 415 BC  He also suggests that the divide between those in favor of the Athenian invasion of Sicily and those opposed was largely a generational divide  Socrates  along with the sophists  was blamed in part by a significant segment of the citizenry for instilling the younger generation with what the older generation perceived as a morally nihilistic  disrespectful attitude   No works by Socrates himself survive  but his younger friend Plato composed numerous  Socratic dialogues   with Socrates as the main character  Socrates s elenctic examination was resented by influential figures of his day  whose reputations for wisdom and virtue were debunked by his questions   One will sometimes find the claim that Socrates described himself as the  gadfly  of Athens which  like a sluggish horse  needed to be aroused by his  stinging   It should be pointed out  however  that in the Greek text of his defense given by Plato  Socrates never actually uses that term  viz    gadfly   Grk   oîstros   to describe himself  Rather  his reference is merely allusive  as he  literally  says only that he has attached himself to the City  proskeimenon tē polei  in order to sting it  Nevertheless  he does make the bold claim that he is a god s gift to the Athenians   Socrates  elenctic method was often imitated by the young men of Athens   Another possible source of resentment were the political views that he and his associates were thought to have embraced  Critias  who appears in two of Plato s Socratic dialogues  was a leader of the Thirty Tyrants  the ruthless oligarchic regime that ruled Athens for eight months in 404–403 BC   but there is also a record of their falling out   As with many of the issues surrounding Socrates’ conviction  the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward  During the reign of the Thirty  many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens  Robin Waterfield asserts that “Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes  where he had close associates among the Pythagoreans who flourished there  and which had already taken in other exiles ” Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens  Socrates  at least in a limited way  chose to remain in Athens  Thus  Waterfield suggests  Socrates’ contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens  even without participating in the Thirty’s bloodthirsty schemes  demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty’s cause  not neutrality towards it  This is proved  Waterfield argues  by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power  anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis  the new home of the expatriate Thirty  Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on a few specific occasions  Plato’s Apology has the character of Socrates describe one such instance  He says that the Thirty ordered him  along with four other men  to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him  Socrates simply did not answer this order  while the other four men did go to Salamis to get Leon   Alcibiades  a controversial figure in Athens  was Socrates’ messmate during the siege of Potidaea  433–429 BC   Socrates remained Alcibiades’ close friend  admirer  and mentor for about five or six years  Known for his flamboyant and audacious behavior  Alcibiades had a volatile relationship with the city of Athens  During his career  Alcibiades famously defected to Sparta after being accused in the defamation of the Mysteries  regained his political prominence in Athens  and was eventually driven out of Athens yet again  Some contempt for Socrates may have stemmed from his relationship with Alcibiades   Moreover  according to the portraits left by some of Socrates  followers  Socrates himself seems to have openly espoused certain anti democratic views  most prominent perhaps being the view that it is not majority opinion that yields correct policy but rather genuine knowledge and professional competence  which is possessed by only a few  Plato also portrays him as being severely critical of some of the most prominent and well respected leaders of the Athenian democracy  and even has him claim that the officials selected by the Athenian system of governance cannot credibly be regarded as benefactors  since it is not any group of many that benefits  but only  some one person or very few   Finally  Socrates was known as often praising the laws of the undemocratic regimes of Sparta and Crete   Apart from his views on politics  Socrates held unusual views on religion  He made several references to his personal spirit  or daimonion  although he explicitly claimed that it never urged him on  but only warned him against various prospective actions  Many of his contemporaries were suspicious of Socrates s daimonion as a rejection of the state religion   2  Historical descriptions  The first tetralogy of dialogues by Plato  Socrates  student  has the trial and execution of Socrates as central theme  Euthyphro  Apology  Crito and Phaedo  Also Xenophon wrote the Apology of Socrates to the jury   An Athenian rhetoric expert  Polycrates  also wrote a pamphlet called the Prosecution of Socrates in 392 BC  Although the contents of the pamphlet itself do not survive  we do have written replies to it by Xenophon and Libanius of Antioch  The pamphlet was supposedly a record of the prosecution speech made by Anytus  one of Socrates’ formal accusers  Polycrates’ account has Anytus condemning Socrates for activity prior to 403 BC  which would be in violation of general amnesty granted by the reconciliation agreement of 403 402 BC  The reconciliation agreement of 403 402 BCI certainly grants some form of amnesty for actions taken before or during the rule of the Thirty  However  the scope of the amnesty is unclear  Waterfield  among others  contends that the scope of the amnesty was quite limited  while many other scholars consider the amnesty comprehensive  For instance  Thomas R  Martin describes the amnesty as “general…under which all further charges and official recriminations concerning the  reign of  terror were forbidden ” If the amnesty included all activity before 403 BC  it seems that we cannot trust Polycrates’ account  If the amnesty was actually more restricted  Polycrates’ account  or what we can glean from other sources discussing it  seems to be a more credible source   3  Proceedings  The second element of the trial was a formal accusation  which the accuser Meletus swore before the Archon  a state office holder with primarily religious duties  Having decided that there was a case to answer  the Archon summoned Socrates to appear before a jury of Athenian citizens  to answer charges of corrupting the youth of Athens and impiety   Athenian juries were drawn by lottery from a group of male citizen volunteers  Unlike trials in many modern societies  majority verdicts were the rule rather than the exception  Neither Plato nor Xenophon mentions the number of Socrates  judges  though Plato s Apology 35a–b does suggest some definite boundaries  that if just thirty of the votes had been otherwise then he would have been acquitted  35a   and that  perhaps  less than three fifths voted against him  35b    After the vote on Socrates  guilt  Socrates and his prosecutor suggested alternative sentences  Socrates  after expressing his surprise of the little amount he needed to have been found innocent  jokingly suggested free meals at the Prytaneum  a particular honor held for city benefactors and winners at the Olympic Games  then offered to pay a fine of 100 drachmae  which was a fifth of his property and a testament to Socrates  poverty  Finally he settled on the sum of 3000 drachmae  put forward by Plato  Crito  Critobulus  and Apollodorus  who guaranteed the payment  His prosecutor proposed the death penalty   The jury voted for death as the penalty – the larger majority showing  Diogenes Laertius 2 42    Socrates s followers encouraged him to flee  see  Crito   and citizens expected him to do so and were probably not averse to it  but he refused on principle  Apparently in accordance with his philosophy of obedience to law  he carried out his own execution  by drinking the hemlock provided to him  Socrates died at the age of 70   See  Phaedo    Many scholars see the conviction and execution of Socrates as a deliberate choice made by the famous philosopher himself  If the accounts of Plato and Xenophon are reasonably accurate  Socrates may have sought not to persuade jurors  but rather to lecture and provoke them   4  Ancient interpretations  Athens had just come through a difficult period  where a Spartan supported group  called the Thirty Tyrants had overturned the city s participatory democracy and sought to impose oligarchic rule  The fact that Critias  the leader of the Tyrants  was one of Socrates s pupils was not seen as a coincidence   His friends tried to make excuses  but the view of the Athenians was probably that expressed by the orator Aeschines some years later  when  in a prosecution speech  he wrote   Did you not put to death Socrates the sophist  fellow citizens  because he was shown to have been the teacher of Critias  one of the Thirty who overthrew the democracy    5  Modern interpretations  The death of Socrates  as presented by Plato  has inspired writers  artists and philosophers in the modern world  in a variety of ways   For some  the execution of the man Plato called  the wisest and most just of all men  has shown the unreliability or undesirability of democratic rule  For others  the Athenians  action was a justifiable defense of their recently re established democracy   I  F  Stone  an American journalist  wrote a book entitled  Trial of Socrates  after his retirement  arguing that Socrates wanted to be sentenced to death in order to justify his opposition to the Athenian democracy  and that Socrates felt that old age would be unpleasant anyway   The 2008 play Socrates on Trial by Andrew Irvine takes a different point of view  Irvine argues that it was because of his loyalty to Athenian democracy that Socrates was willing to accept the verdict of his fellow citizens  As Irvine puts it  “During a time of war and great social and intellectual upheaval  Socrates felt compelled to express his views openly  regardless of the consequences  As a result  he is remembered today  not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards  but also for his loyalty to the view that in a democracy the best way for a man to serve himself  his friends  and his city – even during times of war – is by being loyal to  and by speaking publicly about  the truth ”  Waterfield  too  argues that Socrates’ death was a voluntary action motivated by a greater purpose  In Waterfield’s version  Socrates “saw himself as healing the city’s ills by his voluntary death ” He argues that Socrates  with his unconventional methods  attempted to resolve the political confusion in Athens  Therefore  he was willing to serve as a “scapegoat ” so that Athens could set aside old disputes and move forward in a new  more harmonious direction   In May 2012  amid the unrest caused by the Greek government debt crisis  an international panel of judges and lawyers held a mock re trial of Socrates in Athens  The split decision of five judges voting  guilty  and five voting  not guilty  resulted in an acquittal  The issue of sentences was not discussed  so as to restrict the discussion only to the facts of the case  but the judges voting to convict indicated they would not have been in favour of the death penalty   6  See also  Apology  Plato   Apology  Xenophon   Crito  Euthyphro  Meno  Phaedo  7  References  8  Further reading  ISBN 978 0 8020 9783 5  cloth   ISBN 978 0 8020 9538 1
