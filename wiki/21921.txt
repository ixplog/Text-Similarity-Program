The Northern Crusades or Baltic Crusades were crusades undertaken by the Christian kings of Denmark  Poland and Sweden  the German Livonian and Teutonic military orders  and their allies against the pagan peoples of Northern Europe around the southern and eastern shores of the Baltic Sea  Swedish and German Catholic campaigns against Russian Eastern Orthodox Christians are also sometimes considered part of the Northern Crusades  Some of these wars were called crusades during the Middle Ages  but others  including most of the Swedish ones  were first dubbed crusades by 19th century romantic nationalist historians  The east Baltic world was transformed by military conquest  first the Livs  Latgallians and Estonians  then the Semigallians  Curonians  Prussians and the Finns underwent defeat  baptism  military occupation and sometimes extermination by groups of Danes  Germans and Swedes   1  Background  The official starting point for the Northern Crusades was Pope Celestine III s call in 1193  but the Christian kingdoms of Scandinavia  Poland and the Holy Roman Empire had begun moving to subjugate their pagan neighbors even earlier  The non Christian people who were objects of the campaigns at various dates included   the Polabian Wends  Sorbs  and Obotrites between the Elbe and Oder rivers  by the Saxons  Danes  and Poles  beginning with the Wendish Crusade in 1147   the peoples of  present day  Finland in 1154  Finland Proper  disputed   1249   Tavastia  and 1293  Karelia   Swedish Crusades  although Christianization had started earlier    Livonians  Latgallians  Selonians  and Estonians  by the Germans and Danes  1193–1227    Semigallians and Curonians  1219–1290    Old Prussians   Lithuanians and Samogitians  by the Germans  unsuccessfully  1236–1316   Armed conflict between the Baltic Finns  Balts and Slavs who dwelt by the Baltic shores and their Saxon and Danish neighbors to the north and south had been common for several centuries before the crusade  The previous battles had largely been caused by attempts to destroy castles and sea trade routes and gain economic advantage in the region  and the crusade basically continued this pattern of conflict  albeit now inspired and prescribed by the Pope and undertaken by Papal knights and armed monks   2  Wendish Crusade  The campaigns started with the 1147 Wendish Crusade against the Polabian Slavs  or  Wends   of what is now northern and eastern Germany  The crusade occurred parallel to the Second Crusade to the Holy Land  and continued irregularly until the 16th century   3  Livonian Crusade  By the 12th century  the peoples inhabiting the lands now known as Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania formed a pagan wedge between increasingly powerful rival Christian states – the Orthodox Church to their east and the Catholic Church to their west  The difference in creeds was one of the reasons they had not yet been effectively converted  During a period of more than 150 years leading up to the arrival of German crusaders in the region  Estonia was attacked thirteen times by Russian principalities  and by Denmark and Sweden as well  Estonians for their part made raids upon Denmark and Sweden  There were peaceful attempts by some Catholics to convert the Estonians  starting with missions dispatched by Adalbert  Archbishop of Bremen in 1045 1072  However  these peaceful efforts seem to have had only limited success   3 1  Campaign against the Livonians  1198–1212   Moving in the wake of German merchants who were now following the old trading routes of the Vikings  a monk named Meinhard landed at the mouth of the Daugava river in present day Latvia in 1180 and was made bishop in 1186  Pope Celestine III proclaimed a crusade against the Baltic heathens in 1195  which was reiterated by Pope Innocent III and a crusading expedition led by Meinhard s successor  Bishop Berthold of Hanover  landed in Livonia  part of present day Latvia  surrounding the Gulf of Riga  in 1198  Although the crusaders won their first battle  Bishop Berthold was mortally wounded and the crusaders were repulsed   In 1199  Albert of Buxhoeveden was appointed by the Archbishop Hartwig II of Bremen to Christianise the Baltic countries  By the time Albert died 30 years later  the conquest and formal Christianisation of present day Estonia and northern Latvia was complete  Albert began his task by touring the Empire  preaching a Crusade against the Baltic countries  and was assisted in this by a Papal Bull  which declared that fighting against the Baltic heathens was of the same rank as participating in a crusade to the Holy Land  Though he landed in the mouth of the Daugava in 1200 with only 23 ships and 500 soldiers  the bishop s efforts ensured that a constant flow of recruits followed  The first crusaders usually arrived to fight during the spring and returned to their homes in the autumn  To ensure a permanent military presence  the Livonian Brothers of the Sword were founded in 1202  The founding by Bishop Albert of the market at Riga in 1201 attracted citizens from the Empire and economic prosperity ensued  At Albert s request  Pope Innocent III dedicated the Baltic countries to the Virgin Mary to popularize recruitment to his army and the name  Mary s Land  has survived up to modern times   In 1206  the crusaders subdued the Livonian stronghold in Turaida on the right bank of Gauja River  the ancient trading route to the Northwestern Rus  In order to gain control over the left bank of Gauja  the stone castle was built in Sigulda before 1210  By 1211  the Livonian province of Metsepole  now Limbaži district  and mixed Livonian Latgallian inhabited county of Idumea  now Straupe  was converted to the Roman Catholic faith  The last battle against the Livonians was the siege of Satezele hillfort near to Sigulda in 1212  The Livonians  who had been paying tribute to the East Slavic Principality of Polotsk  had at first considered the Germans as useful allies  The first prominent Livonian to be christened was their leader Caupo of Turaida  As the German grip tightened  the Livonians rebelled against the crusaders and the christened chief  but were put down  Caupo of Turaida remained an ally of the crusaders until his death in the Battle of St  Matthew s Day in 1217   The German crusaders enlisted newly baptised Livonian warriors to participate in their campaigns against Latgallians and Selonians  1208–1209   Estonians  1208–1227  and against Semigallians  Samogitians and Curonians  1219–1290    3 2  Campaign against the Latgallians and Selonians  1208–1224   After the subjugation of the Livonians the crusaders turned their attention to the Latgallian principalities to the east  along the Gauja and Daugava rivers  The military alliance in 1208 and later conversion from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism of the Principality of Tālava was the only peaceful subjugation of the Baltic tribes during the Nordic crusades  The ruler of Tālava  Tālivaldis  Talibaldus de Tolowa   became the most loyal ally of German crusaders against the Estonians  and he died a Catholic martyr in 1215  The war against the Latgallian and Selonian countries along the Daugava waterway started in 1208 by occupation of the Orthodox Principality of Koknese and the Selonian hillfort of Sēlpils  The campaign continued in 1209 with an attack on the Orthodox Principality of Jersika  known as Lettia   accused by crusaders of being in alliance with Lithuanian pagans  After defeat the king of Jersika  Visvaldis  became the vassal of the Bishop of Livonia and received part of his country  Southern Latgale  as a fiefdom  The Selonian stronghold of Sēlpils was briefly the seat of a Selonian diocese  1218–1226   and then came under the rule of the Livonian Order  Only in 1224  with the division of Tālava and Adzele counties between the Bishop of Rīga and the Order of the Swordbearers  did Latgallian countries finally became the possession of German conquerors  The territory of the former Principality of Jersika was divided by the Bishop of Rīga and the Livonian Order in 1239   3 3  Campaign against the Estonians  1208–1224   By 1208  the Germans were strong enough to begin operations against the Estonians  who were at that time divided into eight major and several smaller counties led by elders with limited co operation between them  In 1208 27  war parties of the different sides rampaged through the Livonian  Northern Latgallian  and Estonian counties  with Livonians and Latgallians normally as allies of the Crusaders  and the Principalities of Polotsk and Pskov appearing as allies of different sides at different times  Hill forts  which were the key centres of Estonian counties  were besieged and captured a number of times  A truce between the war weary sides was established for three years  1213–1215  and proved generally more favourable to the Germans  who consolidated their political position  while the Estonians were unable to develop their system of loose alliances into a centralised state  The Livonian leader Kaupo was killed in battle near Viljandi  Fellin  on 21 September 1217  but the battle was a crushing defeat for the Estonians  whose leader Lembitu was also killed  Since 1211  his name had come to the attention of the German chroniclers as a notable Estonian elder  and he had become the central figure of the Estonian resistance   The Christian kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden were also greedy for conquests on the Eastern shores of the Baltic  While the Swedes made only one failed foray into western Estonia in 1220  the Danish Fleet headed by King Valdemar II of Denmark had landed at the Estonian town of Lindanisse  present day Tallinn  in 1219  After the Battle of Lyndanisse the Danes established a fortress  which was besieged by Estonians in 1220 and 1223  but held out  Eventually  the whole of northern Estonia came under Danish control   3 4  Wars against Saaremaa  1206–61   The last Estonian county to hold out against the invaders was the island county of Saaremaa  whose war fleets had raided Denmark and Sweden during the years of fighting against the German crusaders   In 1206  a Danish army led by king Valdemar II and Andreas  the Bishop of Lund landed on Saaremaa and attempted to establish a stronghold without success  In 1216 the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the bishop Theodorich joined forces and invaded Saaremaa over the frozen sea  In return the Oeselians raided the territories in Latvia that were under German rule the following spring  In 1220  the Swedish army led by king John I of Sweden and the bishop Karl of Linköping conquered Lihula in Rotalia in Western Estonia  Oeselians attacked the Swedish stronghold the same year  conquered it and killed the entire Swedish garrison including the Bishop of Linköping   In 1222  the Danish king Valdemar II attempted the second conquest of Saaremaa  this time establishing a stone fortress housing a strong garrison  The Danish stronghold was besieged and surrendered within five days  the Danish garrison returned to Revel  leaving bishop Albert of Riga s brother Theodoric  and few others  behind as hostages for peace  The castle was razed to the ground by the Oeselians   A 20 000 strong army under Papal legate William of Modena crossed the frozen sea while the Saaremaa fleet was icebound  in January 1227  After the surrender of two major Oeselian strongholds  Muhu and Valjala  the Oeselians formally accepted Christianity   In 1236  after the defeat of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in the Battle of Saule  military action on Saaremaa broke out again  In 1261  warfare continued as the Oeselians had once more renounced Christianity and killed all the Germans on the island  A peace treaty was signed after the united forces of the Livonian Order  the Bishopric of Ösel Wiek  and Danish Estonia  including mainland Estonians and Latvians  defeated the Oeselians by conquering their stronghold at Kaarma  Soon thereafter  the Livonian Order established a stone fort at Pöide   3 5  Wars against the Curonians and Semigallians  1201–90   Although the Curonians had attacked Riga in 1201 and 1210  Albert of Buxhoeveden  considering Courland a tributary of Valdemar II of Denmark  had been reluctant to conduct a large scale campaign against them  After Albert s death in 1229  the crusaders secured the peaceful submission of Vanemane  a county with a mixed Livonian  Oselian  and Curonian population in the northeastern part of Courland  by treaty in 1230  In the same year the papal vice legat Baldouin of Alnea annulled this agreement and concluded an agreement with the ruler of Bandava in the central Courland Lamekins  Lammechinus rex   delivering his kingdom into the hands of the papacy  Baldouin became the popes s delegate in Courland and bishop of Semigallia  however  the Germans complained about him to the Roman Curia  and in 1234 Pope Gregory IX removed Baldouin as his delegate   After their decisive defeat in the Battle of Saule by the Samogitians and Semigallians  the remnants of the Swordbrothers were reorganized in 1237 as a subdivision of the Teutonic Order  and became known as the Livonian Order  In 1242  under the leadership of the master of the Livonian Order Andrew of Groningen  the crusaders began the military conquest of Courland  They defeated the Curonians as far south as Embūte  near the contemporary border with Lithuania  and founded their main fortress at Kuldīga  In 1245 Pope Innocent IV allotted two thirds of conquered Courland to the Livonian Order  and one third to the Bishopric of Courland   At the Battle of Durbe in 1260 a force of Samogitians and Curonians overpowered the united forces of the Livonian and Teutonic Orders  over the following years  however  the Crusaders gradually subjugated the Curonians  and in 1267 concluded the peace treaty stipulating the obligations and the rights of their defeated rivals  The unconquered southern parts of their territories  Ceklis and Megava  were united under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania   The conquest of Semigallian counties started in 1219 when crusaders from Rīga occupied Mežotne  the major port on the Lielupe waterway  and founded the Bishopric of Semigallia  After several unsuccessful campaigns against the pagan Semigallian duke Viestards and his Samogitian kinsfolk  the Roman Curia decided in 1251 to abolish the Bishopric of Semigallia  and divided its territories between the Bishopric of Rīga and the Order of Livonia  In 1265 a stone castle was built at Jelgava  on the Lielupe  and became the main military base for crusader attacks against the Semigallians  In 1271 the capital hillfort of Tērvete was conquered  but Semigallians under the Duke Nameisis rebelled in 1279  and the Lithuanians under Traidenis defeated Livonian Order forces in the Battle of Aizkraukle  Duke Nameisis  warriors unsuccessfully attacked Rīga in 1280  in response to which around 14 000 crusaders besieged Turaida castle in 1281  To conquer the remaining Semigallian hillforts the Order s master Villekin of Endorpe built a castle called Heiligenberg right next to the Tērvete castle in 1287  The same year the Semigallians made another attempt to conquer Rīga  but again failed to take it  On their return home Livonian knights attacked them  but were defeated at the Battle of Garoza  in which the Orders  master Villekin and at least 35 knights lost their lives  The new master of the Order Cuno of Haciginstein organised the last campaigns against the Semigallians in 1289 and 1290  the hillforts of Dobele  Rakte and Sidarbe were conquered and most of the Semigallian warriors joined the Samogitian and Lithuanian forces   4  Prussia and Lithuania  4 1  Campaigns of Konrad of Masovia  Konrad I  the Polish Duke of Masovia  unsuccessfully attempted to conquer pagan Prussia in crusades in 1219 and 1222  Taking the advice of the first Bishop of Prussia  Christian of Oliva  Konrad founded the crusading Order of Dobrzyń  or Dobrin  in 1220  However  this order was largely ineffective  and Konrad s campaigns against the Old Prussians were answered by incursions into the already captured territory of Culmerland  Chełmno Land   Subjected to constant Prussian counter raids  Konrad wanted to stabilize the north of the Duchy of Masovia in this fight over border area of Chełmno Land  Masovia had only been conquered in the 10th century and native Prussians  Yotvingians  and Lithuanians were still living in the territory  where no settled borders existed  His military weakness led Konrad to invite the Teutonic Knights to Prussia   4 2  Teutonic Order  The Northern Crusades provided a rationale for the growth and expansion of the Teutonic Order of German crusading knights which had been founded in Palestine at the end of the 12th century  Due to Muslim successes in the Holy Land  the Order sought new missions in Europe  Duke Konrad I of Masovia in west central Poland appealed to the Knights to defend his borders and subdue the pagan Baltic Prussians in 1226  After the subjugation of the Prussians  the Teutonic Knights fought against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania   When the Livonian knights were crushed by Samogitians in the Battle of Saule in 1236  coinciding with a series of revolts in Estonia  the Livonian Order was inherited by the Teutonic Order  allowing the Teutonic Knights to exercise political control over large territories in the Baltic region  Mindaugas  the King of Lithuania  was baptised together with his wife after his coronation in 1253  hoping that this would help stop the Crusaders  attacks  which it did not  The Teutonic Knights failed to subdue pagan Lithuania  which officially converted to  Catholic  Christianity in 1386 on the marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila to the 11 year old Queen Jadwiga of Poland  However  even after the country was officially converted  the crusades continued up until the Battle of Grunwald in 1410  when the Lithuanians and Poles  helped by the Tatars  Moldovans and the Czechs  defeated the Teutonic knights   The Teutonic Order s attempts to conquer Orthodox Russia  particularly the Republics of Pskov and Novgorod   an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX  can also be considered as a part of the Northern Crusades  One of the major blows for the idea of the conquest of Russia was the Battle of the Ice in 1242  With or without the Pope s blessing  Sweden also undertook several crusades against Orthodox Novgorod   5  See also  Ostsiedlung  Swedish Crusades  Danish Estonia  History of Belarus  History of Estonia  History of Finland  History of Latvia
