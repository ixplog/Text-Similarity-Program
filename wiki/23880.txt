Psycho is a 1960 American psychological thriller horror film directed by Alfred Hitchcock starring Anthony Perkins  Vera Miles  John Gavin  and Janet Leigh  The screenplay is by Joseph Stefano  based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch loosely inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein   The film centers on the encounter between a secretary  Marion Crane  Leigh   who ends up at a secluded motel after embezzling money from her employer  and the motel s disturbed owner manager  Norman Bates  Perkins   and its aftermath  When originally made  the film was seen as a departure from Hitchcock s previous film North by Northwest  having been filmed on a low budget  with a television crew and in black and white  Psycho initially received mixed reviews  but outstanding box office returns prompted reconsideration which led to overwhelming critical acclaim and four Academy Award nominations  including Best Supporting Actress for Leigh and Best Director for Hitchcock   It is now considered one of Hitchcock s best films and praised as a work of cinematic art by international film critics and film scholars  Ranked among the greatest films of all time  it set a new level of acceptability for violence  deviant behavior and sexuality in American films  and is widely considered to be the earliest example of the slasher film genre  After Hitchcock s death in 1980  Universal Studios began producing follow ups  three sequels  a remake  a television film spin off  and a TV series   In 1992  the US Library of Congress deemed the film  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant  and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry   1  Plot  Marion Crane and her boyfriend Sam Loomis meet for a secret romantic rendezvous during a Friday lunch hour at a hotel in downtown Phoenix  Arizona  They discuss how they can barely afford to get married due to Sam s debts  Marion returns to work at a realtor s office  A client comes in with $40 000 in cash to purchase a house as a wedding gift for his daughter  The client flirts with Marion  Her boss instructs her to promptly deposit the money in the bank  puts the money envelope in her purse  Marion then asks her boss if she can take the rest of the afternoon off and that she was not feeling well  Back at her room  Marion starts packing to leave for an undetermined time  while contemplating taking the money  She decides to steal it  and leave Phoenix  drive to  mythical  Fairvale  California  to give it to Sam  However  upon passing through downtown Phoenix on her way out of town  stopped at a traffic light  she is spotted by her boss as he crosses the street  which unsettles her   On the road now in California  she pulls over at night to sleep but is awakened the following morning by a California Highway Patrolman who can tell something is wrong because of her furtive  anxious behavior  The officer  however  lets her go  Upon arriving in Bakersfield  Marion pulls into a used car dealership to hastily exchange her car  a 1956 Ford Mainline   for another  a 1957 Ford Custom 300   Driving up US 99 during the rainy night  she imagines conversations in her mind of her boss and the client discussing the stolen money  and becomes increasingly nervous  After accidentally taking a wrong turn  she drives up to the Bates Motel  a remote lodge that has recently lost business due to a diversion realignment of the main highway  The youthful proprietor Norman Bates  nervous but friendly  invites her to a light dinner  Marion  alone in her cabin  overhears a heated argument between Norman and his mother about inviting her to the house  he ends up bringing her dinner to the motel parlor  Norman talks about his daily life and his hobby  taxidermy and discloses that his mother Norma is mentally ill  but he becomes agitated when Marion suggests his mother be institutionalized  During their conversation  Marion decides to return to Phoenix and return the stolen money  Upon returning to her cabin  Norman  looking through a hole he had made in the parlor wall long ago  sees her undress  and returns to his house behind the motel  Marion subtracts the amount of money she spent from the stolen money  then tears up the paper and flushes it down the toilet  The burden now lifted from her conscience  she takes a relaxing shower  during which a shadowy figure of an elderly woman quietly enters the bathroom  shoves back the shower curtain and proceeds to stab her repeatedly to death with a large kitchen knife  The figure then leaves the cabin with the shower still running  with Marion laying on the floor dead  Norman comes into the cabin and  discovers  Marion s dead body and  convinced that his mother had committed the crime  wraps the body in the shower curtain  and cleans up the bathroom  He puts Marion s wrapped body in the trunk of her car  along with all her possessions and  unknowingly  the money  and sinks it in a nearby swamp   A week later  Marion s sister Lila arrives in Fairvale to confront Sam Loomis about Marion s whereabouts in his hardware store  A private detective named Arbogast confirms Marion is suspected of having stolen $40 000 from her employer  Arbogast eventually finds the Bates Motel  Norman s evasiveness and stammering arouse his suspicions  when Norman mentions that Marion had met his mother  Arbogast demands to speak to her but Norman refuses  From a payphone  Arbogast calls Lila and Sam to tell them about his encounter with Norman  and that he intends to return to the motel to attempt to speak to Bates  mother  He would call Lila and Sam again in an hour  Upon entering the Bates  residence  looking for Norman s mother  a figure emerges from her room and murders Arbogast on top of the staircase   After three hours  fearing something has happened to Arbogast  Sam and Lila go into Fairvale to talk with the local sheriff  The sheriff is puzzled by the detective s claim that he was planning to talk to Norman s mother  stating that Mrs  Norma Bates died ten years ago  along with her lover  in a murder suicide  He calls Norman to ask him about Arbogast  and is told that he asked some questions and left  Back at the Bates  house  Norman  seen from above  carries his mother down to the cellar of their house  she verbally protests the arrangement  but he explains that she needs to hide from whoever comes next looking for Arbogast and Marion   Sam and Lila  posing as husband and wife on a business trip  rent a room at the Bates Motel to search the cabin that Marion stayed in  Lila finds a scrap of paper  with  $40 000 written on it  that Marion supposedly flushed down the toilet  while Sam notes that the bathtub has no shower curtain  Lila  not believing Ms  Bates is dead  is determined to speak to Mrs  Bates  Sam and Lila develops a plan  Sam is to distract Norman with conversation while Lila sneaks into the house to look for Mrs  Bates  Lila searches hers and Norman s rooms  The conversation between Sam and Norman turns sour  Sam accusing Norman of stealing the $40 000 to re start his life  Norman angrily orders Sam and his wife to leave the motel  then wants to know where Sam s wife was  The two begin to grapple  but Norman subdues Sam  and runs into the house to accost Lila  Lila  spotting Norman approaching  hides in the cellar and sees Mrs  Bates sitting in a rocking chair  her back to Lila  She calls out to the woman  getting no reply  Lila taps Mrs  Bates  shoulder  the chair then rotates to reveal the desiccated corpse of Mrs  Bates  shocking Lila into screaming with fear  A figure enters the basement  wearing a dress and wig while wielding a large knife  revealing Norman to be the murderer all along  Sam then enters behind Norman  just managing to overpower Norman   At the county courthouse after Norman s arrest  a psychiatrist who interviews Norman reveals not only the killings of Marion and Arbogast  but that Norman had been excessively dominated by his mother since childhood  and when she took a lover  he became insanely jealous that she had  replaced  him  then murdered his mother and her lover  Later  he developed a split personality to erase the crime of matricide from his memory and  immortalize  his mother by stealing and  preserving  her corpse  When he feels any sexual attraction towards someone  as was the case with Marion  the  Mother  side of his mind becomes jealous and enraged  At times  he is able to function as Norman but other times  the  Mother  personality completely dominates him  The psychiatrist also reveals that Norman  in his  Mother  state  had killed two missing young girls some time prior to Marion and Arbogast   Norman is now locked into his mother s identity permanently  Mrs  Bates  who  in a voice over  talks about how it was really Norman  not her  who committed all those murders and that she should have  put him away  years ago  finally saying that she  wouldn t even harm a fly   A double exposure shows Norman s face merging with that of his mother s corpse   The final scene shows Marion s car being recovered from the swamp   2  Cast  Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates  Janet Leigh as Marion Crane  Vera Miles as Lila Crane  John Gavin as Sam Loomis  Martin Balsam as Milton Arbogast  John McIntire as Al Chambers  Simon Oakland as Dr  Fred Richmond  Frank Albertson as Tom Cassidy  Pat Hitchcock as Caroline  Vaughn Taylor as George Lowery  Lurene Tuttle as Mrs  Chambers  John Anderson as California Charlie  Mort Mills as Highway Patrol Officer  Virginia Gregg  Jeanette Nolan  and Paul Jasmin  uncredited  as voice of Norma Bates  Ted Knight  uncredited  as a policeman guarding Norman Bates The success of Psycho jump started Perkins  career  but he soon began to suffer from typecasting  However  when Perkins was asked whether he would have still taken the role knowing that he would be typecast afterwards  he replied with a definite  yes    Until her death  Leigh continued to receive strange and sometimes threatening calls  letters  and even tapes detailing what they would like to do to Marion Crane  One letter was so  grotesque  that she passed it along to the FBI  two of whose agents visited Leigh and told her the culprits had been located and that she should notify the FBI if she received any more letters of that type   Norman s mother was voiced by Virginia Gregg  Paul Jasmin  and Jeanette Nolan  who also provided some screams for Lila s discovery of the mother s corpse  The three voices were thoroughly mixed  except for the last speech  which is all Gregg s   Anne Dore was chosen by Hitchcock to double for Perkins in the shower sequence in Psycho  since he did not want any of Perkins s physicality to betray his identity at that point in the film  Dore wore the mother s costume and did all the stabbing actions   3  Production  3 1  Development  Psycho is based on Robert Bloch s 1959 novel of the same name  loosely based on the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein  Both Gein  who lived just 40 miles from Bloch  and the story s protagonist  Norman Bates  were solitary murderers in isolated rural locations  Each had deceased domineering mothers  sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to her  and dressed in women s clothes  However  unlike Bates  Gein is not strictly considered a serial killer  having been charged with murder only twice  Peggy Robertson  Hitchcock s long time assistant  read Anthony Boucher s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to him  even though studio readers at Paramount Pictures had already rejected its premise for a film  Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9 500 and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to preserve the novel s surprises  Hitchcock  who had come to face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own  was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount  Flamingo Feather and No Bail for the Judge  He disliked stars  salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material  including Robertson   Paramount executives balked at Hitchcock s proposal and refused to provide his usual budget  In response  Hitchcock offered to film Psycho quickly and inexpensively in black and white using his Alfred Hitchcock Presents television series crew  Paramount executives rejected this cost conscious approach  claiming their sound stages were booked even though the industry was in a slump  Hitchcock countered he would personally finance the project and film it at Universal International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would merely distribute  In lieu of his usual $250 000 director s fee he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative  This combined offer was accepted and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of naysaying from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive Joan Harrison   3 2  Novel adaptation  James P  Cavanagh  a writer on the Alfred Hitchcock Presents television series  penned the original screenplay  Hitchcock felt the script dragged and read like a television short horror story  an assessment shared by an assistant  Though Stefano had worked on only one film before  Hitchcock agreed to meet with him  despite Stefano s inexperience the meeting went well and he was hired   The screenplay is relatively faithful to the novel  with a few notable adaptations by Hitchcock and Stefano  Stefano found the character of Norman Bates — who  in the book  is middle aged  overweight  and more overtly unstable — unsympathetic  but became more intrigued when Hitchcock suggested casting Anthony Perkins  Stefano eliminated Bates  drinking  which evidently necessitated removing Bates   becoming  the Mother personality when in a drunken stupor  Also gone is Bates  interest in spiritualism  the occult and pornography  Hitchcock and Stefano elected to open the film with scenes in Marion s life and not introduce Bates at all until 20 minutes into the film  rather than open with Bates reading a history book as Bloch does  Indeed  writer Joseph W  Smith notes that   Her story occupies only two of the novel s 17 chapters  Hitchcock and Stefano expanded this to nearly half the narrative   He likewise notes there is no hotel tryst between Marion and Sam in the novel  For Stefano  the conversation between Marion and Norman in the hotel parlor in which she displays a maternal sympathy towards him makes it possible for the audience to switch their sympathies towards Norman Bates after Marion s murder  When Lila Crane is looking through Norman s room in the film she opens a book with a blank cover whose contents are unseen  in the novel these are  pathologically pornographic  illustrations  Stefano wanted to give the audience  indications that something was quite wrong  but it could not be spelled out or overdone   In his book of interviews with Hitchcock  François Truffaut notes that the novel  cheats  by having extended conversations between Norman and  Mother  and stating what Mother is  doing  at various given moments  For obvious reasons  these were omitted from the film   The first name of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion  since a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix  Also changed is the novel s budding romance between Sam and Lila  Hitchcock preferred to focus the audience s attention on the solution to the mystery  and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap  Instead of having Sam explain Norman s pathology to Lila  the film uses a psychiatrist   Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother at the time of writing the film   The novel is more violent than the film  for instance  Crane is beheaded in the shower as opposed to being stabbed to death  Minor changes include changing Marion s telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet  This provided some shock effect  since toilets were virtually never seen in American cinema in the 1960s  The location of Arbogast s death was moved from the foyer to the stairwell  Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about  Mother  without tipping that something was being hidden  As Janet Leigh put it  this gave Hitchcock more options for his camera   3 3  Pre production  Paramount  whose contract guaranteed another film by Hitchcock  did not want Hitchcock to make Psycho  Paramount was expecting No Bail for the Judge starring Audrey Hepburn  who became pregnant and had to bow out  leading Hitchcock to scrap the production  Their official stance was that the book was  too repulsive  and  impossible for films   and nothing but another of his star studded mystery thrillers  They did not like  anything about it at all  and denied him his usual budget  So  Hitchcock financed the film s creation through his own Shamley Productions  shooting at Universal Studios under the Revue television unit  Hitchcock s original Bates Motel and Psycho House movie set buildings  which were constructed on the same stage as Lon Chaney Sr  s The Phantom of the Opera  are still standing at Universal Studios in Universal City near Hollywood and are a regular attraction on the studio s tour  As a further result of cost cutting  Hitchcock chose to film Psycho in black and white  keeping the budget under $1 000 000  Other reasons for shooting in black and white were his desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory and his admiration for Les Diaboliques s use of black and white   To keep costs down and because he was most comfortable around them  Hitchcock took most of his crew from his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents  including the cinematographer  set designer  script supervisor  and first assistant director  He hired regular collaborators Bernard Herrmann as music composer  George Tomasini as editor  and Saul Bass for the title design and storyboarding of the shower scene  In all  his crew cost $62 000   Through the strength of his reputation  Hitchcock cast Leigh for a quarter of her usual fee  paying only $25 000  in the 1967 book Hitchcock Truffaut  Hitchcock said that Leigh owed Paramount one final film on her seven year contract which she had signed in 1953   His first choice  Leigh agreed after having only read the novel and making no inquiry into her salary  Her co star  Anthony Perkins  agreed to $40 000  Both stars were experienced and proven box office draws   Paramount did distribute the film  but four years later Hitchcock sold his stock in Shamley to Universal s parent company and his next six films were made at and distributed by Universal Pictures  After another four years  Paramount sold all rights to Universal   3 4  Filming  The film  independently produced and financed by Hitchcock  was shot at Revue Studios  the same location as his television show  Psycho was shot on a tight budget of $806 947 55  beginning on November 11  1959 and ending on February 1  1960  Filming started in the morning and finished by six or earlier on Thursdays  when Hitchcock and his wife would dine at Chasen s   Nearly the whole film was shot with 50 mm lenses on 35 mm cameras  This trick closely mimicked normal human vision  which helped to further involve the audience   Before shooting began in November  Hitchcock dispatched assistant director Hilton Green to Phoenix to scout locations and shoot the opening scene  The shot was supposed to be an aerial shot of Phoenix that slowly zoomed into the hotel window of a passionate Marion and Sam  Ultimately  the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio  Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between Fresno and Bakersfield  California for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix  They also provided the location shots for the scene in which she is discovered sleeping in her car by the highway patrolman  In one street scene shot in downtown Phoenix  Christmas decorations were discovered to be visible  rather than re shoot the footage  Hitchcock chose to add a graphic to the opening scene marking the date as  Friday  December the Eleventh    Green also took photos of a prepared list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio  These included many real estate offices and homes such as those belonging to Marion and her sister  He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe  which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig  the wardrobe supervisor  The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper s painting The House by the Railroad  a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw  NY   Both the leads  Perkins and Leigh  were given freedom to interpret their roles and improvise as long as it did not involve moving the camera  An example of Perkins  improvisation is Norman s habit of eating candy corn   Throughout filming  Hitchcock created and hid various versions of the  Mother corpse  prop in Leigh s dressing room closet  Leigh took the joke well  and she wondered whether it was done to keep her on edge and thus more in character or to judge which corpse would be scarier for the audience   During shooting  Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes  The final shot in the shower scene  which starts with an extreme close up on Marion s eye and pulls up and out  proved very difficult for Leigh  since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink  and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera  Retakes were also required for the opening scene  since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough  Leigh had trouble saying  Not inordinately  for the real estate office scene  requiring additional retakes  Lastly  the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around  Miles hitting the light bulb  and a lens flare  which proved to be the sticking point  Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction   According to Hitchcock  a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were directed by Hilton Green  working with storyboard artist Saul Bass  drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold  However  upon viewing the dailies of the shots  Hitchcock was forced to scrap them  He claimed they were  no good  because they did not portray  an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs   Hitchcock later re shot the scene  though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film  Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film s twist  A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chairlike device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks   Alfred Hitchcock s cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films  In Psycho  he can be seen through a window – wearing a Stetson hat – standing outside Marion Crane s office  Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo so that he could be in a scene with his daughter  who played one of Marion s colleagues   Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance in the film in order to avoid distracting the audience   3 5  The shower scene  The murder of Leigh s character in the shower is the film s pivotal scene and one of the best known in all of cinema  As such  it spawned numerous myths and legends  It was shot from December 17–23  1959  and features 77 different camera angles  The scene  runs 3 minutes and includes 50 cuts   Most of the shots are extreme close ups  except for medium shots in the shower directly before and directly after the murder  The combination of the close shots with their short duration makes the sequence feel more subjective than it would have been if the images were presented alone or in a wider angle  an example of the technique Hitchcock described as  transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience    In order to capture the straight on shot of the shower head  the camera had to be equipped with a long lens  The inner holes on the shower head were blocked and the camera placed a sufficient distance away so that the water  while appearing to be aimed directly at the lens  actually went around and past it   The soundtrack of screeching violins  violas  and cellos was an original all strings piece by composer Bernard Herrmann titled  The Murder   Hitchcock originally intended to have no music for the sequence  and all motel scenes   but Herrmann insisted he try his composition  Afterward  Hitchcock agreed it vastly intensified the scene  and nearly doubled Herrmann s salary  The blood in the scene is reputed to have been Bosco chocolate syrup  which shows up better on black and white film  and has more realistic density than stage blood  The sound of the knife entering flesh was created by plunging a knife into a casaba melon   There are varying accounts whether Leigh was in the shower the entire time or a body double was used for some parts of the murder sequence and its aftermath  In an interview with Roger Ebert and in the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho  Leigh stated she was in the scene the entire time and Hitchcock only used a stand in for the sequence in which Norman wraps Marion s body in a shower curtain and places it in the trunk of her car  The 2010 book The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock s Shower by Robert Graysmith contradicts this  identifying Marli Renfro as Leigh s body double for some of the shower scene s shots   A popular myth emerged that  in order for Leigh s scream in the shower to sound realistic  ice cold water was used  Leigh denied this on numerous occasions  saying the crew was very accommodating  supplying hot water throughout the week long shoot  All of the screams are Leigh s   Another concerns Saul Bass  the graphic designer who created many of the title sequences of Hitchcock s films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes  claiming he had directed the shower scene  This was refuted by several figures associated with the film  including Leigh  who stated   absolutely not  I have emphatically said this in any interview I ve ever given  I ve said it to his face in front of other people     I was in that shower for seven days  and  believe me  Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera for every one of those seventy odd shots   Hilton Green  the assistant director  also refutes Bass  claim   There is not a shot in that movie that I didn t roll the camera for  And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr  Bass   Roger Ebert  a longtime admirer of Hitchcock s work  summarily dismissed the rumor  stating   It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock s would let someone else direct such a scene    However  commentators such as Stephen Rebello and Bill Krohn have argued in favor of Bass  contribution to the scene in his capacity as visual consultant and storyboard artist  Along with designing the opening credits  Bass is termed  Pictorial Consultant  in the credits  When interviewing Hitchcock in 1967  François Truffaut asked about the extent of Bass  contribution  to which Hitchcock replied that in addition to the titles  Bass had provided storyboards for the Arbogast murder  which he claimed to have rejected   but made no mention of Bass providing storyboards for the shower scene  According to Bill Krohn s Hitchcock At Work  Bass  first claim to have directed the scene was in 1970  when he provided a magazine with 48 drawings used as storyboards as proof of his contribution   Krohn s analysis of the production of Psycho in his book Hitchcock at Work  while refuting Bass  claims for directing the scene  notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably  the fact that the killer appears as a silhouette  and details such as the close ups of the slashing knife  Leigh s desperate outstretched arm  the shower curtain being torn down  and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane s dead eyes  Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for Vertigo   Krohn s research also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras  one a BNC Mitchell  the other a handheld camera called an Éclair which Orson Welles had used in Touch of Evil  1958   In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience  Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room  He even brought a Moviola on the set to gauge the footage required  The final sequence  which his editor George Tomasini worked on with Hitchcock s advice  however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass  storyboards   According to Donald Spoto in The Dark Side of Genius  Hitchcock s wife  Alma Reville  spotted a blooper in one of the last screenings of Psycho before its official release  after Marion was supposedly dead  one could see her blink  According to Patricia Hitchcock  talking in Laurent Bouzereau s  making of  documentary  Alma spotted that Leigh s character appeared to take a breath  In either case  the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences  Although Marion s eyes should be dilated after her death  the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimatization to wear them  so Hitchcock decided to forgo them   It is often claimed that  despite its graphic nature  the  shower scene  never once shows a knife puncturing flesh  However  a frame by frame analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh s abdomen  but the effect may have been created by lighting and reverse motion  Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it  that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to  she would lock all the doors and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open  She never realized until she first watched the film  how vulnerable and defenseless one is    Leigh and Hitchcock fully discussed what the scene meant   Film theorist Robin Wood also discusses how the shower washes  away her guilt   He comments upon the  alienation effect  of killing off the  apparent center of the film  with which spectators had identified   4  Soundtrack  4 1  Score  Hitchcock insisted that Bernard Herrmann write the score for Psycho despite the composer s refusal to accept a reduced fee for the film s lower budget  The resulting score  according to Christopher Palmer in The Composer in Hollywood  1990  is  perhaps Herrmann s most spectacular Hitchcock achievement   Hitchcock was pleased with the tension and drama the score added to the film  later remarking  33% of the effect of Psycho was due to the music   The singular contribution of Herrmann s score may be inferred from the unusual penultimate placement of the composer s name in the film s opening credit sequence  as it is followed only by Hitchcock s directing credit   Herrmann used the lowered music budget to his advantage by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble  contrary to Hitchcock s request for a jazz score  He thought of the single tone color of the all string soundtrack as a way of reflecting the black and white cinematography of the film  The strings play con sordini  with a muting device placed across the bridge  for all the music other than the shower scene  creating a darker and more intense effect  Hollywood composer Fred Steiner  in an analysis of the score to Psycho  points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone  dynamics  and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have   The main title music  a tense  hurtling piece  sets the tone of impending violence  and returns three times on the soundtrack  Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15–20 minutes of the film  the title music remains in the audience s mind  lending tension to these early scenes  Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film through the use of ostinato   There were rumors that Herrmann had used electronic means  including amplified bird screeches to achieve the shocking effect of the music in the shower scene  The effect was achieved  however  only with violins in a  screeching  stabbing sound motion of extraordinary viciousness   The only electronic amplification employed was in the placing of the microphones close to the instruments  to get a harsher sound  Besides the emotional impact  the shower scene cue ties the soundtrack to birds  The association of the shower scene music with birds also telegraphs to the audience that it is Norman  the stuffed bird collector  who is the murderer rather than his mother   Herrmann biographer Steven C  Smith writes that the music for the shower scene is  probably the most famous  and most imitated  cue in film music   but Hitchcock was originally opposed to having music in this scene  When Herrmann played the shower scene cue for Hitchcock  the director approved its use in the film  Herrmann reminded Hitchcock of his instructions not to score this scene  to which Hitchcock replied   Improper suggestion  my boy  improper suggestion   This was one of two important disagreements Hitchcock had with Herrmann  in which Herrmann ignored Hitchcock s instructions  The second one  over the score for Torn Curtain  1966   resulted in the end of their professional collaboration  A survey conducted by PRS for Music  in 2009  showed that the British public consider the score from  the shower scene  to be the scariest theme from any film   To honor the fiftieth anniversary of Psycho  in July 2010  the San Francisco Symphony obtained a print of the film with the soundtrack removed  and projected it on a large screen in Davies Symphony Hall while the orchestra performed the score live  This was previously mounted by the Seattle Symphony in October 2009 as well  performing at the Benaroya Hall for two consecutive evenings  These performances are part of John Goberman s offering of films with great music performed by live orchestras  A Symphonic Night at the Movies  these special events range from  Alexander Nevsky  to  Singin in the Rain  to  Hitchcock     4 2  Recordings  Several CDs of the film soundtrack have been released  including   The 1970s

appeared in the United States during the 1960s after the erosion of the Production Code  It was unprecedented in its depiction of sexuality and violence  right from the opening scene in which Sam and Marion are shown as lovers sharing the same bed  with Marion in a bra  In the Production Code standards of that time  unmarried couples shown in the same bed would be taboo   According to the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho  the censors in charge of enforcing the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh s breasts  Hitchcock held onto the print for several days  left it untouched  and resubmitted it for approval  Each of the censors reversed their positions  those who had previously seen the breast now did not  and those who had not  now did  They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh s stand in  The board was also upset by the racy opening  so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re shoot the opening with them on the set  Since they did not show up for the re shoot  the opening stayed   Another cause of concern for the censors was that Marion was shown flushing a toilet  with its contents  torn up note paper  fully visible  No flushing toilet had appeared in mainstream film and television in the United States at that time   Internationally  Hitchcock was forced to make minor changes to the film  mostly to the shower scene  In Britain and New Zealand  the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to and in Singapore  though the shower scene was left untouched  the murder of Arbogast  and a shot of Mother s corpse were removed   The most controversial move was Hitchcock s  no late admission  policy for the film  which was unusual for the time  It was not entirely original as Clouzot had done the same in France for Diabolique  Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh  they would feel cheated  At first theater owners opposed the idea  claiming that they would lose business  However  after the first day  the owners enjoyed long lines of people waiting to see the film   6  Promotion  Hitchcock did most of the promotion on his own  forbidding Leigh and Perkins to make the usual television  radio  and print interviews for fear of their revealing the plot  Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public  which  despite possibly affecting their reviews  certainly preserved the secret   The film s original trailer features a jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer on a tour of the set  and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself  It is  tracked  with Herrmann s Psycho theme  but also jovial music from Hitchcock s comedy The Trouble with Harry  most of Hitchcock s dialogue is post synchronized  The trailer was made after completion of the film  and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming  Hitchcock had Vera Miles don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview  Since the title   Psycho   instantly covers most of the screen  the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years  However  a freeze frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Miles and not Leigh in the shower during the trailer  The Nostalgia Critic has recently stated that the trailer for the film is one of the greatest  if not  the greatest of all time  His analysis was centered around how Hitchcock managed to give everything away and nothing away at the same time  He also made numerous points to how Hitchcock would talk about the murders  but never about the motivation  and also stated with Hitchcock giving viewers descriptions of horrible murders and is rather unfazed while discussing them  He stated that Hitchcock made the movie sound so disturbing and surreal that viewers just had to go see what made him so uncomfortable trying to discuss what was happening in the trailer   The film was so successful that it was reissued to theaters in 1965  A year later  CBS purchased the television rights for $450 000  CBS planned to televise the film on September 23  1966  but three days earlier  Valerie Percy  daughter of Illinois senate candidate Charles H  Percy  was murdered  As her parents slept mere feet away  she was stabbed a dozen times with a double edged knife  In light of the murder  CBS agreed to postpone the screening  but as a result of the Apollo pad fire of January 27  1967  the network washed its hands of Psycho  and shortly afterward Paramount included the film in its first syndicated package of post 1950 movies   Portfolio I   WABC TV in New York City was the first station in the country to air Psycho  with some scenes significantly edited   on its late night movie series  The Best of Broadway  on June 24  1967  Following another successful theatrical reissue in 1969  the film finally made its way to general television airing in one of Universal s syndicated programming packages for local stations in 1970  Psycho was aired for twenty years in this format  then leased to cable for two years before returning to syndication as part of the  List of a Lifetime  package   7  Interpretations  7 1  Subversion of romance through irony  In Psycho  Hitchcock subverts the romantic elements that are seen in most of his work  The film is instead ironic as it prevents  clarity and fulfillment  of romance  The past is central to the film  the main characters  struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories  and ultimately fail  Lesley Brill writes   The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness   The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist  Marion Crane  halfway through the film  Marion is like Persephone of Greek mythology  who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living  The myth does not sustain with Marion  who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel  The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone s flowers  but they are only  reflected in mirrors  as images of images—twice removed from reality   In the scene of Marion s death  Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion s lifeless eye   Like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini s La Dolce Vita  it marks the birth of death  an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption   Unlike heroines in Hitchcock s other films  she does not reestablish her innocence or discover love   Marion is deprived of  the humble treasures of love  marriage  home and family   which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness  There exists among Psychos secondary characters a lack of  familial warmth and stability   which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies  The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity  such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion  agreeing to marry her  only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp  Sam and Marion s sister Lila  in investigating Marion s disappearance  develop an  increasingly connubial  relationship  a development that Marion is denied  Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity  He has  an infantile and divided personality  and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present  Norman displays stuffed birds that are  frozen in time  and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room  He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past  such as with Marion s suggestion to put his mother  someplace  and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past  Brill explains    Someplace  for Norman is where his delusions of love  home  and family are declared invalid and exposed    Light and darkness feature prominently in Psycho  The first shot after the intertitle is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures  Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness  she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom  When she flees Phoenix  darkness descends on her drive  The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses  and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness  Bright lights are also  the ironic equivalent of darkness  in the film  blinding instead of illuminating  Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam s and Marion s hotel room  vehicle headlights at night  the neon sign at the Bates Motel   the glaring white  of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies  and the fruit cellar s exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman s mother  Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock s films   7 2  Motifs  The film often features shadows  mirrors  windows  and  less so  water  The shadows are present from the very first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out the window  The stuffed birds  shadows loom over Marion as she eats  and Norman s mother is seen in only shadows until the very end  More subtly  backlighting turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila s head   Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs  her eyes as she checks the rear view mirror  her face in the policeman s sunglasses  and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership s bathroom  A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together  Hitchcock shoots through Marion s windshield and the telephone booth  when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila  The heavy downpour can be seen as foreshadowing of the shower  and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix   There are a number of references to birds  Marion s last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix  Norman comments that Marion eats like a bird  The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall  Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman s hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex   stuffing birds   bird being a British slang for a desirable woman  Robert Allan suggests that Norman s mother is his original  stuffed bird   both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman s emotional bond with her   7 3  Psychoanalytic interpretation  Psycho has been called  the first psychoanalytical thriller   The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film   The shower scene is both feared and desired   wrote French film critic Serge Kaganski   Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits  but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists  since Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene    In his documentary The Pervert s Guide to Cinema  Slavoj Žižek remarks that Norman Bates  mansion has three floors  paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis  the top floor would be the superego  where Bates  mother lives  the ground floor is then Bates  ego  where he functions as an apparently normal human being  and finally  the basement would be Bates  id  Žižek interprets Bates  moving his mother s corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id   8  Reception  Initial reviews of the film were thoroughly mixed  Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote   There is not an abundance of subtlety or the lately familiar Hitchcock bent toward significant and colorful scenery in this obviously low budget job   Crowther called the  slow buildups to sudden shocks  reliably melodramatic but contested Hitchcock s psychological points  reminiscent of Krafft Ebing s studies  as less effective  While the film did not conclude satisfactorily for the critic  he commended the cast s performances as  fair   British critic C  A  Lejeune was so offended that she not only walked out before the end but permanently resigned her post as film critic for The Observer  Other negative reviews stated   a blot on an honorable career    plainly a gimmick movie   and  merely one of those television shows padded out to two hours   Positive reviews stated   Anthony Perkins  performance is the best of his career     Janet Leigh has never been better    played out beautifully   and  first American movie since Touch of Evil to stand in the same creative rank as the great European films   A good example of the mix is the New York Herald Tribune s review  which stated       rather difficult to be amused at the forms insanity may take     keeps your attention like a snake charmer    The public loved the film  with lines stretching outside of theaters as people had to wait for the next showing  This  along with box office numbers  lead to a reconsideration of the film by critics  and it eventually received a very large amount of praise  It broke box office records in Japan and the rest of Asia  France  Britain  South America  the United States  and Canada  and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period  It was the most profitable black and white sound film ever made  and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million  He then swapped his rights to Psycho and his TV anthology for 150 000 shares of MCA  making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc  and his own boss at Universal  in theory  however  this did not stop them from interfering with his later films  Psycho was  by a large margin  the most profitable film of Hitchcock s career  earning over $12 million for the studio on release  and $15 million by the end of the year  Hitchcock s second most profitable was Family Plot  $7 541 000   and third place was a tie between Torn Curtain  1966  and Frenzy  1972   each earning $6 500 000  Around the time of the run s end  the film had grossed $32 million in domestic theaters   In the United Kingdom  the film shattered attendance records at the London Plaza Cinema  but nearly all British critics panned it  questioning Hitchcock s taste and judgment  Reasons cited for this were the critics  late screenings  forcing them to rush their reviews  their dislike of the gimmicky promotion  and Hitchcock s expatriate status  Perhaps thanks to the public s response and Hitchcock s efforts at promoting it  the critics did a re review  and the film was praised  TIME switched its opinion from  Hitchcock bears down too heavily in this one  to  superlative  and  masterly   and Bosley Crowther put it on his Top Ten list of 1960   Psycho was initially criticized for making other filmmakers more willing to show gore  three years later  Blood Feast  considered to be the first  splatter film   was released  Psychos success financially and critically had others trying to ride its coattails  Inspired by Psycho  Hammer Film Productions launched a series of mystery thrillers including The Nanny  1965  starring Bette Davis and William Castle s Homicidal  1961  was followed by a slew of more than thirteen other splatter films   On the review aggregator website  RottenTomatoes com  Psycho holds a  Certified  Fresh  score of 96%  with the critics consensus reading   Infamous for its shower scene  but immortal for its contribution to the horror genre  Because Psycho was filmed with tact  grace  and art  Hitchcock didn t just create modern horror  he validated it    9  Recognition  In 1992  the film was deemed  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant  by the United States Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry   In 1998  TV Guide ranked it #8 on their list of the 50 Greatest Movies on TV  and Video    Leigh asserted   no other murder mystery in the history of the movies has inspired such merchandising   Any number of items emblazoned with Bates Motel  stills  lobby cards  and highly valuable posters are available for purchase  In 1992  it was adapted scene for scene into three comic books by the Innovative Corporation   Psycho has appeared on a number of lists by websites  television channels  and magazines  The shower scene was featured as number four on the list of Bravo Network s 100 Scariest Movie Moments  whilst the finale was ranked number four on Premieres similar list  Entertainment Weekly s book titled The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time ranked the film as #11    American Film Institute lists  AFI s 100 Years   100 Movies – #18  AFI s 100 Years   100 Thrills – #1  AFI s 100 Years   100 Heroes and Villains   Norman Bates – #2 Villain  AFI s 100 Years   100 Movie Quotes    A boy s best friend is his mother   – #56   We all go a little mad sometimes   – Nominated  AFI s 100 Years of Film Scores – #4  AFI s 100 Years   100 Movies  10th Anniversary Edition  – #14  10  Legacy  10 1  Sequels  Three sequels were produced  Psycho II  1983   Psycho III  1986   and Psycho IV  The Beginning  1990   the last being a part prequel television movie written by the original screenplay author  Joseph Stefano  Anthony Perkins returned to his role of Norman Bates in all three sequels  and also directed the third film  The voice of Norman Bates  mother was maintained by noted radio actress Virginia Gregg with the exception of Psycho IV  where the role was played by Olivia Hussey  Vera Miles also reprised her role of Lila Crane in Psycho II  The sequels were well received but considered inferior to the original   10 2  1987 Bates Motel pilot  Bates Motel was a failed television pilot spin off which later aired as a television movie  before the release of Psycho IV   Anthony Perkins declined to appear in the pilot  so Norman s cameo appearance was played by Kurt Paul  who was Perkins  stunt double on Psycho II and III   10 3  1998 remake  Gus Van Sant directed a 1998 remake of Psycho  The film is in color and features a different cast  but aside from this it is a near shot for shot remake copying Hitchcock s camera movements and editing  The film was panned by critics and audiences alike and was a box office bomb   A Conversation with Norman  2005   directed by Jonathan M  Parisen  was a film inspired by Psycho   10 4  2012 Hitchcock film  In 2005  it was reported that a new film was in development based on the book by Stephen Rebello  Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho  The film was originally titled Alfred Hitchcock Presents  and it was originally to be directed by Ryan Murphy  Later the film was retitled Hitchcock  and filming began on April 13  2012  Filming was completed in early June 2012 with a worldwide release on December 14  2012  The film centers on the relationship between Hitchcock and his wife and co worker Alma Reville during the filming of Psycho in 1959  The film was directed by Sacha Gervasi and written by John McLaughlin and Stephen Rebello  The film stars Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock  Helen Mirren as Reville  Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh  Jessica Biel as Vera Miles  and James D Arcy as Anthony Perkins  The film was released worldwide on December 14  2012  to mostly positive reviews and one Academy Award nomination   10 5  The Psycho Legacy  On October 19  2010  an independent documentary called The Psycho Legacy was released on DVD  The documentary discussed the legacy and impact Psycho has had  not only on cinema  but on the world in general  The documentary also included production stories about Psycho II  Psycho III and Psycho IV  The Beginning  This documentary received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans   10 6  Bates Motel series  On January 13  2012  A&E announced that a television series called Bates Motel was in development at the network  The TV series has nothing to do with the earlier Bates Motel failed TV pilot released in 1987  The series takes place before the events of the original film and chronicles Norman Bates  teen years living at the Bates Motel  as did the flashback sequences in Psycho IV  The Beginning  However  the series is set in the present day in a seaside town in Oregon rather than the inland California town of the film   thus the series is a reboot  though it s been widely reviewed as a prequel  as it is devoted to providing a backstory to a younger Norman Bates prior to his becoming a murderer  In July 2012  A&E announced that the network had picked up the show for a 10 episode first season  skipping the initial pilot stage  The series premiered on March 18  2013 to high ratings and very positive reviews  The show aired a second season in 2014 and is scheduled to return for a third in 2015   10 7  Psychos  On February 24  2014  a mashup  video  of Alfred Hitchcock s and Gus Van Sant s versions of Psycho appeared on Steven Soderbergh s Extension 765 website  Retitled  Psychos  and featuring no explanatory text  the recut appears to be a fan edit of the two films by Soderbergh  Reaction to the mashup appears to reinforce the prejudice against the 1998 film  The opening credits intermingle names from both the 1960 and 1998 versions  and all color has been removed from Van Sant s scenes   11  Cultural impact  Psycho has become one of the most recognizable films in cinema history  and is arguably Hitchcock s best known film  In his novel  Bloch used an uncommon plot structure  he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists  then killed them off  This played on his reader s expectations of traditional plots  leaving them uncertain and anxious  Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences  and utilized it in his adaptation  killing off Leigh s character at the end of the first act  This daring plot device  coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box office name in the film  was a shocking turn of events in 1960   The most original and influential moment in the film is the  shower scene   which became iconic in pop culture because it is often regarded as one of the most terrifying scenes ever filmed  Part of its effectiveness was due to the use of startling editing techniques borrowed from the Soviet montage filmmakers  and to the iconic screeching violins in Bernard Herrmann s musical score  The iconic shower scene is frequently spoofed  given homage to and referenced in popular culture  complete with the violin screeching sound effects  see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  among many others    In 2008  Marion Cotillard re enacted the shower scene in a photoshoot for Vanity Fair  Cotillard shares the same first name of Janet Leigh s character in Psycho  who was called Marion Crane   Psycho is now widely considered to be the first film in the slasher film genre  and has been referenced in films numerous times  examples include the 1974 musical horror film Phantom of the Paradise  1978 horror film Halloween  which starred Jamie Lee Curtis  Janet Leigh s daughter   the 1977 Mel Brooks tribute to many of Hitchcock s thrillers  High Anxiety  the 1980 Fade to Black  the 1980 Dressed to Kill and Wes Craven s 1996 horror satire Scream  Bernard Herrmann s opening theme has been sampled by rapper Busta Rhymes on his song  Gimme Some More   1998   Manuel Muñoz s 2011 novel What You See in the Dark includes a sub plot that fictionalizes elements of the filming of Psycho  referring to Hitchcock and Leigh only as  The Director  and  The Actress   In the comic book stories of Jonni Future  the house inherited by title character is patterned after the Bates Motel   The Simpsons pays tribute to the film in several episodes such as  Brother From The Same Planet   Principal Skinner looks over his shoulder at his house and sees his mother  Agnes  in the window  and screams    Realty Bites   Ned screaming like a woman seems to mirror Marion Crane s murder in the film and the mansion that the Flanders family buys  before it is destroyed  seems to resemble the mansion from the film   and  The Springfield Files   The theme from the shower scene plays when it appears a fearful Homer is being followed and is about to be hit by a bus  until two violinists exit the bus and the theme fades as they walk away    12  Ratings  Psycho has been rated and re rated several times over the years by the MPAA  Upon its initial release  the film received a certificate stating that it was  Approved   certificate #19564  under the simple pass fail system of the Production Code in use at that time  Later  when the MPAA switched to a voluntary letter ratings system in 1968  Psycho was one of a number of high profile motion pictures to be retro rated with an  M   Mature Audiences   This remained the only rating the film would receive for 16 years  and according to the guidelines of the time  M  was the equivalent of a  PG  rating  Then  in 1984  during the uproar of increased parental concern regarding violence in  PG  films  Psycho was retro rated again to its current rating of  R   This rating took effect  however  before the institution of the  PG 13  rating by the MPAA that same year  and there are those who have speculated that if the rating had existed at the time  or if Psycho were rated in America today  it would receive a  PG 13    13  Home media  The film has been released several times on videotape  LaserDisc  DVD  and Blu ray Disc  MCA DiscoVision Incorporated  parent
