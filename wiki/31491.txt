Theoretical chemistry seeks to provide explanations to chemical and physical observations  Theoretical chemistry includes the fundamental laws of physics Coulomb s law  Kinetic energy  Potential energy  the Virial Theorem  Planck s Law  Pauli exclusion principle and many others to explain but also predict chemical observed phenomena   In order to explain an observation one has to choose the  appropriate level of theory   For example  some theoretical methods  DFT  may not be appropriate to solve magnetic coupling or electron transitions properties  Instead  there are reports like Multireference configuration interaction  MRCI   which accurately and thoroughly explain the observed phenomena by means of the fundamental interactions   Major components include quantum chemistry  the application of quantum mechanics to the understanding of valence  molecular dynamics  statistical thermodynamics and theories of electrolyte solutions  reaction networks  polymerization  catalysis  molecular magnetism and spectroscopy   1  Branches of theoretical chemistry   Quantum chemistry  The application of quantum mechanics or fundamental interactions to chemical and physico chemical problems  Spectroscopic and magnetic properties are between the most frequently modelled   Computational chemistry  The application of computer codes to chemistry  involving approximation schemes such as Hartree–Fock  post Hartree–Fock  density functional theory  semiempirical methods  such as PM3  or force field methods  Molecular shape is the most frequently predicted property  Computers can also predict vibrational spectra and vibronic coupling  but also acquire and Fourier transform Infra red Data into frequency information  The comparison with predicted vibrations supports the predicted shape   Molecular modelling  Methods for modelling molecular structures without necessarily referring to quantum mechanics  Examples are molecular docking  protein protein docking  drug design  combinatorial chemistry  The fitting of shape and electric potential are the driving factor in this graphical approach   Molecular dynamics  Application of classical mechanics for simulating the movement of the nuclei of an assembly of atoms and molecules  The rearrangement of molecules within an ensemble is controlled by Van der Waals forces and promoted by temperature   Molecular mechanics  Modelling of the intra  and inter molecular interaction potential energy surfaces via empirical potentials  The latter are usually parameterized from ab initio calculations   Mathematical chemistry  Discussion and prediction of the molecular structure using mathematical methods without necessarily referring to quantum mechanics  Topology is a branch of mathematics that allows to predict properties of flexible finite size bodies like clusters   Theoretical chemical kinetics  Theoretical study of the dynamical systems associated to reactive chemicals  the activated complex and their corresponding differential equations   Cheminformatics  also known as chemoinformatics   The use of computer and informational techniques  applied to crop information to solve problems in the field of chemistry   2  Closely related disciplines  Historically  the major field of application of theoretical chemistry has been in the following fields of research   Atomic physics  The discipline dealing with electrons and atomic nuclei   Molecular physics  The discipline of the electrons surrounding the molecular nuclei and of movement of the nuclei  This term usually refers to the study of molecules made of a few atoms in the gas phase  But some consider that molecular physics is also the study of bulk properties of chemicals in terms of molecules   Physical chemistry and chemical physics  Chemistry investigated via physical methods like laser techniques  scanning tunneling microscope  etc  The formal distinction between both fields is that physical chemistry is a branch of chemistry while chemical physics is a branch of physics  In practice this distinction is quite vague   Many body theory  The discipline studying the effects which appear in systems with large number of constituents  It is based on quantum physics – mostly second quantization formalism – and quantum electrodynamics  Hence  the theoretical chemistry discipline is sometimes seen as a branch of those fields of research  Nevertheless  more recently  with the rise of the density functional theory and other methods like molecular mechanics  the range of application has been extended to chemical systems which are relevant to other fields of chemistry and physics like biochemistry  condensed matter physics  nanotechnology or molecular biology   3  See also  List of unsolved problems in
