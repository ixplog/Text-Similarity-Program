Pre Socratic philosophy is Greek philosophy before Socrates  and includes schools contemporary with Socrates that were not influenced by him   In Classical antiquity  the Presocratic philosophers were called physiologoi    in English  physical or natural philosophers   Aristotle called them physikoi   physicists   after physis   nature   because they sought natural explanations for phenomena  as opposed to the earlier theologoi  theologians   whose philosophical basis was supernatural  Diogenes Laërtius divides the physiologoi into two groups  Ionian and Italiote  led by Anaximander and Pythagoras  respectively   Hermann Diels popularized the term pre socratic in Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker  The Fragments of the Pre Socratics  in 1903  However  the term pre Sokratic was in use as early as George Grote s Plato and the Other Companions of Sokrates in 1865  Edouard Zeller was also important in dividing thought before and after Socrates  Major analyses of pre Socratic thought have been made by Gregory Vlastos  Jonathan Barnes  and Friedrich Nietzsche in his Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks   It may sometimes be difficult to determine the actual line of argument some Presocratics used in supporting their particular views  While most of them produced significant texts  none of the texts has survived in complete form  All that is available are quotations by later philosophers  often biased  and historians  and the occasional textual fragment   The Presocratic philosophers rejected traditional mythological explanations of the phenomena they saw around them in favor of more rational explanations  These philosophers asked questions about  the essence of things    From where does everything come   From what is everything created   How do we explain the plurality of things found in nature   How might we describe nature mathematically  Others concentrated on defining problems and paradoxes that became the basis for later mathematical  scientific and philosophic study   Later philosophers rejected many of the answers the early Greek philosophers provided  but continued to place importance on their questions  Furthermore  the cosmologies proposed by them have been updated by later developments in science   1  History  Western philosophy began in ancient Greece in the 6th century BCE  The Presocratics were mostly from the eastern or western fringes of the Greek world  Their efforts were directed to the investigation of the ultimate basis and essential nature of the external world  They sought the material principle  archê  of things  and the method of their origin and disappearance  As the first philosophers  they emphasized the rational unity of things  and rejected mythological explanations of the world  Only fragments of the original writings of the presocratics survive  The knowledge we have of them derives from accounts of later philosophical writers  especially Aristotle  Plutarch  Diogenes Laërtius  Stobaeus and Simplicius   and some early theologians  especially Clement of Alexandria and Hippolytus of Rome   The Presocratic thinkers present a discourse concerned with key areas of philosophical inquiry such as being and the cosmos  the primary stuff of the universe  the structure and function of the human soul  and the underlying principles governing perceptible phenomena  human knowledge and morality   1 1  Milesian school  The first Presocratic philosophers were from Miletus on the western coast of Anatolia  Thales  624 546 BCE  is reputedly the father of Greek philosophy  he declared water to be the basis of all things  Next came Anaximander  610 546 BCE   the first writer on philosophy  He assumed as the first principle an undefined  unlimited substance without qualities  out of which the primary opposites  hot and cold  moist and dry  became differentiated  His younger contemporary  Anaximenes  585 525 BCE   took for his principle air  conceiving it as modified  by thickening and thinning  into fire  wind  clouds  water  and earth   1 2  Pythagoreanism  The practical side of philosophy was introduced by Pythagoras of Samos  582 496 BCE   Regarding the world as perfect harmony  dependent on number  he aimed at inducing humankind likewise to lead a harmonious life  His doctrine was adopted and extended by a large following of Pythagoreans who gathered at his school in south Italy in the town of Croton  His followers included Philolaus  470 380 BCE   Alcmaeon of Croton  and Archytas  428 347 BCE    1 3  Ephesian school  Heraclitus of Ephesus on the western coast of Anatolia in modern Turkey  535 475 BCE  posited that all things in nature are in a state of perpetual flux  connected by logical structure or pattern  which he termed Logos  To Heraclitus  fire  one of the four classical elements  motivates and substantiates this eternal pattern  From fire all things originate  and return to it again in a process of eternal cycles   1 4  Eleatic school  The Eleatic School  called after the town of Elea  modern name Velia in south Italy   emphasized the doctrine of the One  Xenophanes of Colophon  570 470 BCE  declared God to be the eternal unity  permeating the universe  and governing it by his thought  Parmenides of Elea  510 440 BCE  affirmed the one unchanging existence to be alone true and capable of being conceived  and multitude and change to be an appearance without reality  This doctrine was defended by his younger countryman Zeno of Elea  490 430 BCE  in a polemic against the common opinion which sees in things multitude  becoming  and change  Zeno propounded a number of celebrated paradoxes  much debated by later philosophers  which try to show that supposing that there is any change or multiplicity leads to contradictions  Melissus of Samos  born c  470 BCE  was another eminent member of this school   1 5  Pluralist school  Empedocles of Agrigentum  490 430 BCE  was from the ancient Greek city of Akragas  Ἀκράγας   Agrigentum in Latin  modern Agrigento  in Sicily  He appears to have been partly in agreement with the Eleatic School  partly in opposition to it  On the one hand  he maintained the unchangeable nature of substance  on the other  he supposes a plurality of such substances   i e  four classical elements  earth  water  air  and fire  Of these the world is built up  by the agency of two ideal motive forces   love as the cause of union  strife as the cause of separation  Anaxagoras of Clazomenae  500 428 BCE  in Asia Minor also maintained the existence of an ordering principle as well as a material substance  and while regarding the latter as an infinite multitude of imperishable primary elements  he conceived divine reason or Mind  nous  as ordering them  He referred all generation and disappearance to mixture and resolution respectively  To him belongs the credit of first establishing philosophy at Athens   1 6  Atomist school  The first explicitly materialistic system was formed by Leucippus  5th century BCE  and his pupil Democritus of Abdera  460 370 BCE  from Thrace  This was the doctrine of atoms   small primary bodies infinite in number  indivisible and imperishable  qualitatively similar  but distinguished by their shapes  Moving eternally through the infinite void  they collide and unite  thus generating objects which differ in accordance with the varieties  in number  size  shape  and arrangement  of the atoms which compose them   1 7  Others  The last of the Presocratic natural philosophers was Diogenes of Apollonia from Thrace  born c  460 BCE   He was an eclectic philosopher who adopted many principles of the Milesian school  especially the single material principle  which he identified as air  He explained natural processes in reference to the rarefactions and condensations of this primary substance  He also adopted Anaxagoras  cosmic thought   1 8  Sophism  The Sophists held that all thought rests solely on the apprehensions of the senses and on subjective impression  and that therefore we have no other standards of action than convention for the individual  Specializing in rhetoric  the Sophists were more professional educators than philosophers  They flourished as a result of a special need at that time for Greek education  Prominent Sophists include Protagoras  490 420 BCE  from Abdera in Thrace  Gorgias  487 376 BCE  from Leontini in Sicily  Hippias  485 415 BCE  from Elis in the Peloponnesos  Prodicus  465 390 BCE  from the island of Ceos  and Thrasymachus  459 400 BCE  from Chalcedon on the Bosphorus   2  Other early Greek philosophers  This list includes several men  particularly the Seven Sages  who appear to have been practical politicians and sources of epigrammatic wisdom  rather than speculative thinkers or philosophers in the modern sense   Seven Sages of Greece  Aristeas of Proconnesus  7th century BCE     Pherecydes of Syros  c  540 BCE   Anacharsis  c  590 BCE   3  Legacy  The Pre Socratic method of critical reasoning deployed in the examination of the natural world was applied by Socrates to an examination of the human individual and his social institutions   Hegel deeply studied the Pre Socratics  crediting the philosopher Parmenides with introducing the concepts of Being and non being  or Nothing    Karl Marx s doctoral thesis  The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature  evaluates the thought of the Pre Socratic philosopher Democritus  one of the founders of Atomic theory   Within the Marxist philosophical tradition the Pre Socratics are recognized as the first Materialists   Nietzsche described the Pre Socratics as The tyrants of the spirit  and says of Socrates that “the hitherto so wonderfully regular  although certainly too rapid  development of the philosophical science was destroyed in one night ”  Oswald Spengler s doctoral thesis  The metaphysical idea of Heraclitus  philosophy  evaluates the thought of the Pre Socratic philosopher Heraclitus  dubbed  the obscure    Karl Popper  one of the 20th Century s most influential philosophers of science  placed great importance on the critical tradition embodied in the development of Pre Socratic thought  the analysis of which contributed to his own epistemological theories  His well known essay on the subject  Back to the Pre Socratics  can be found
