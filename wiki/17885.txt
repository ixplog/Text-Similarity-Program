The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the German Wehrmacht during World War II  After the German Empire s World War I era army air force  the Luftstreitkräfte  and the Kaiserliche Marine naval air units had been disbanded by May 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles  the Luftwaffe was reformed on 26 February 1935 and grew to become one of the strongest  most doctrinally advanced  and most battle experienced air forces in the world when World War II started in Europe in September 1939  After the defeat of the Third Reich  the Luftwaffe was disbanded in 1946   Luftwaffe is also the generic term in German speaking countries for any national military aviation service  and the names of air forces in other countries are usually translated into German as  Luftwaffe   e g  Royal Air Force is often translated as  britische Luftwaffe    However  Luftstreitkräfte  or  air armed force   is also sometimes used as a translation of  air force  for post World War I air arms  as it was used as the first word of the official German name of the former East German Air Force  disbanded the day before German reunification was achieved in October 1990  Since  Luft  translates into English as  air   and  Waffe  may be translated into English as either  weapon  or  arm    Air Arm  may be considered the most literal English translation of Luftwaffe  cf  Fleet Air Arm    One of the forerunners of the Luftwaffe  the Imperial German Army Air Service  was founded in 1910  After the defeat of Germany in WW I  the service was dissolved in 1920 under the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles  During the interwar period  German pilots trained in violation of the treaty in secret  By the summer of 1939  the Luftwaffe had nine Jagdgeschwader  fighter wings  mostly equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E  four  Zerstörergeschwader  destroyer wings  equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter  11 Kampfgeschwader  bomber wings  equipped with mainly the Heinkel He 111 and the Dornier Do 17Z and four Sturzkampfgeschwader  dive bomber wings   The Luftwaffes Condor Legion experimented with new doctrine and aircraft during the Spanish Civil War  Throughout the history of the Third Reich  the Luftwaffe had only two commanders in chief  The first was Hermann Göring  with the second and last being Generalfeldmarschall Robert Ritter von Greim   When the Second World War began  the Luftwaffe was one of the most technologically advanced air forces in the world  From the start of the war till its end  it was engaged in war crimes and atrocities  starting with strafing civilian refugees to human experiments  In the summer of 1940  the Luftwaffe contributed to the unexpected success in the Battle of France  During the Battle of Britain  the Luftwaffe  despite causing severe damage to the Royal Air Force s infrastructure and British cities during the subsequent Blitz  did not achieve air superiority  The Defence of the Reich campaign gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe s fighter arm  Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket propelled aircraft for bomber destroyer duties  it was overwhelmed by Allied numbers and a lack of trained pilots and fuel  A last ditch attempt  known as Operation Bodenplatte  to win air superiority in January 1945 failed  After the Bodenplatte effort  the Luftwaffe had ceased to be an effective fighting force   1  Origin  1 1  World War I  One of the forerunners of the Luftwaffe  the Imperial German Army Air Service  was founded in 1910 with the name Die Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches  most often shortened to Fliegertruppe  It was renamed Luftstreitkräfte by October 1916  The air war on the Western Front received the most attention in the annals of the earliest accounts of military aviation  since it produced aces such as Manfred von Richthofen  popularly known as the Red Baron  Ernst Udet  Oswald Boelcke  Werner Voss  and Max Immelmann  many of whom would later serve in the Luftwaffe  and Manfred von Richthofen s eventual successor to the command of JG I  Hermann Göring  the Luftwaffe s commander in chief for most of its existence   After the defeat of Germany  the service was dissolved on 8 May 1920 under the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles  which also mandated the destruction of all military aircraft of Germany   1 2  Interwar period  Since the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to have an air force  German pilots trained in violation of the treaty in secret  Initially  civil aviation schools within Germany were used  yet only light trainers could be used in order to maintain the façade that the trainees were going to fly with civil airlines such as Deutsche Luft Hansa  To train its pilots on the latest combat aircraft  Germany solicited the help of its future enemy  the Soviet Union  which was also isolated in Europe  A secret training airfield was established at Lipetsk in 1924 and operated for approximately nine years using mostly Dutch and Russian  but also some German  training aircraft before being closed in 1933  This base was officially known as 4th squadron of the 40th wing of the Red Army  Hundreds of Luftwaffe pilots and technical personnel visited  studied and were trained at Soviet air force schools in several locations in Central Russia  Roessing  Blume  Fosse  Teetsemann  Heini  Makratzki  Blumendaat and many other future Luftwaffe aces were trained in Russia in joint Russian German schools that were set up under the patronage of Ernst August Köstring   The first steps towards the Luftwaffe s formation were undertaken just months after Adolf Hitler came to power  Hermann Göring  a World War I ace with 22 victories and the holder of the Orden Pour le Mérite  became National Kommissar for aviation with former Deutsche Luft Hansa director Erhard Milch as his deputy  In April 1933 the Reichsluftfahrtministerium  RLM – Reich Air Ministry  was established  The RLM was in charge of development and production of aircraft  and soon afterwards the test site or Erprobungsstelle at Rechlin became its testing ground  a military airfield that had been first established in August 1918  Göring s control over all aspects of aviation became absolute  On 25 March 1933 the Deutschen Luftsportverband  DVLA   German Air Sport Association  absorbed all private and national organizations  whilst retaining its  sports  title  The merging of all military aviation organizations in the RLM took place on 15 May 1933  which became the Luftwaffe s official  birthday   Many members of the Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps  National Socialist Flyers Corps –NSFK  transferred to the Luftwaffe  As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members  this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military  Göring had played a leading role in the buildup of the Luftwaffe in 1933–1936  but played little further part in the development of the Luftwaffe until 1936  and Milch became the  de facto  minister until 1937   The absence of Göring in planning and production matters was fortunate  Göring had little knowledge of current aviation  had last flown in 1922  and had not kept himself informed of latest events  Göring also displayed a lack of understanding of doctrine and technical issues in aerial warfare which he left to others more competent  The Commander in Chief left the organisation and building of the Luftwaffe  after 1936  to Erhard Milch  However Göring  as a part of Hitler s inner circle  was to provide enormous financial materials for rearming and equipping the Luftwaffe   Another prominent figure in German air power construction this time was Helmuth Wilberg  Wilberg was to play a large role in the development of German air doctrine  Having headed the Reichswehr air staff for eight years in the 1920s  Wilberg had considerable experience and was ideal for a senior staff position  Göring considered making Wilberg Chief of Staff  CS   However  it was revealed Wilberg had a Jewish mother  For that reason Göring could not have him as CS  Not wishing his talent to go to waste  Göring ensured the racial laws of the Third Reich did not apply to him  Wilberg remained in the air staff and helped draw up the principle doctrine  The Conduct of the Aerial War  and its  Regulation 16  under Walther Wever   2  Preparing for war  1933–39  2 1  The Wever years  1933–36  Contrary to popular belief in American and British circles  the Luftwaffe was not  the hand maiden of the German Army   The German officer Corps was keen to develop strategic bombing capabilities against its enemies  However  economic and geopolitical considerations had to take priority  The German air power theorists continued to develop strategic theories  but emphasis was given to army support  as Germany was a continental power and expected to face ground operations following any declaration of hostilities   For these reasons  between 1933 and 1934  the Luftwaffe s leadership was primarily concerned with tactical and operational methods  In aerial terms  the army concept of Truppenführung was an operational concept  as well as a tactical doctrine  In the First World War  air units had been attached to specific army formations and acted as support  Dive bomber units were considered essential to Truppenführung  destroying Headquarters and lines of communications  Luftwaffe  Regulation 10  The Bomber   Dienstvorschrift 10  Das Kampfflugzeug   published in 1934  advocated air superiority and approaches to ground attack tactics without dealing with operational matters  Until 1935  the 1926 manual  Directives for the Conduct of the Operational Air War  continued to act as the main guide for German air operations  The manual directed the OKL to focus on limited operations  not strategic operations   the protection of specific areas and support of the army in combat   With an effective tactical operational concept  the German air power theorists needed a strategic doctrine and organisation  Robert Knauss  a serviceman  not pilot  in the Luftstreitkräfte during the First World War  and later an experienced pilot with Lufthansa  was a prominent theorist of air power  Knauss promoted the Giulio Douhet theory that air power could win wars alone by destroying enemy industry and morale by  terrorizing the population  of major cities  This advocated attacks on civilians  The General Staff blocked the entry of Douhet s theory into doctrine  fearing revenge strikes against German civilians and cities   In December 1934  Chief of the Luftwaffe General Staff Walther Wever sought to mould the Luftwaffe s battle doctrine into a strategic plan  At this time  Wever conducted war games  simulated against the French  in a bid to establish his theory of a strategic bombing force that would  he thought  prove decisive by winning the war through the destruction of enemy industry  even though these exercises also included tactical strikes against enemy ground forces and communications  In 1935   Luftwaffe Regulation 16  The Conduct of the Air War  was drawn up  In the proposal  it concluded   The mission of the Luftwaffe is to serve these goals    Within this doctrine  the Luftwaffe leadership rejected the practice of  terror bombing   see Luftwaffe strategic bombing doctrine   Terror bombing was deemed to be  counter productive   increasing rather than destroying the enemy s will to resist  Such bombing campaigns were regarded as diversion from the Luftwaffe s main operations  destruction of the enemy armed forces  The bombings of Guernica  Rotterdam and Warsaw were considered tactical missions in support of military operations and were not intended as strategic terror attacks   Nevertheless  Wever recognised the importance of strategic bombing  In newly introduced doctrine  The Conduct of the Aerial Air War in 1935  Wever rejected the theory of Douhet and outlined five key points to air strategy   1  To destroy the enemy air force by bombing its bases and aircraft factories  and defeating enemy air forces attacking German targets  2  To prevent the movement of large enemy ground forces to the decisive areas by destroying railways and roads  particularly bridges and tunnels  which are indispensable for the movement and supply of forces 3  To support the operations of the army formations  independent of railways  i e  armoured forces and motorised forces  by impeding the enemy advance and participating directly in ground operations  4  To support naval operations by attacking naval bases  protecting Germany s naval bases and participating directly in naval battles 5  To paralyse the enemy armed forces by stopping production in the armaments factories  Wever began planning for a strategic bomber force and sought to incorporate strategic bombing into a war strategy  He believed that tactical aircraft should only be used as a step to developing a strategic air force  In May 1934  Wever initiated a seven year project for the  Ural Bomber   the bomber that would take the Luftwaffe s bombing campaign into the heart of the Soviet Union  In 1935  this led to the Dornier Do 19 and Junkers Ju 89 prototypes  although both were underpowered  In April 1936  Wever ordered a requirement for  Bomber A  which would have a range of 6 700 km  4 163 mi  with a 900 kg  1 984 lb  bomb load  However Wever s vision of a  Ural  bomber was never realised  and his emphasis on strategic aerial operations was lost  with the only design submittal for Wever s  Bomber A  that would reach production being Heinkel s Projekt 1041  which became officially known on 5 November 1937 as the Heinkel He 177   By the late 1930s the Luftwaffe had no clear purpose  The air force was not subordinated to the army support role  and it was not given any particular strategic mission  German doctrine fell between the two concepts  The Luftwaffe was to be an organisation capable of carrying out broad and general support tasks rather than any specific mission  Mainly  this path was chosen to encourage a more flexible use of air power and offer the ground forces the right conditions for a decisive victory  In fact  on the outbreak of war  only 15% of the Luftwaffe s aircraft was devoted to ground support operations  exposing a long held myth that the Luftwaffe was designed for only tactical and operational missions   2 2  A change of direction  1936–37  Wever s participation in the construction of the Luftwaffe came to an abrupt end on 3 June 1936 when he was killed along with his engineer in a Heinkel He 70 Blitz  ironically on the very day that his  Bomber A  heavy bomber design competition was announced  After Wever s death Göring began taking more of an interest in the appointment of Luftwaffe staff officers  Göring appointed his successor Albert Kesselring as CS and Ernst Udet head the Reich s Air Ministry Technical Office  Technisches Amt   although he was not a technical expert  Despite this Udet was appointed to and helped change the Luftwaffe s tactical direction towards producing fast medium bombers that were to destroy enemy air power in the battle zone rather than through industrial bombing of its aviation production   Kesselring and Udet did not get on  During Kesselring s time as CS  1936–1937  a power struggle developed between the two as Udet attempted to extend his own power within the Luftwaffe  Kesselring also had to contend with Göring appointing  yes men  to positions of importance  Udet realised his limitations  and his failures in the production and development of German aircraft would have serious long term consequences   The failure of the Luftwaffe to progress further towards attaining a strategic bombing force was attributable to several reasons  Many in the Luftwaffe command believed medium bombers to be sufficient power to launch strategic bombing operations against Germany s most likely enemies  France  Czechoslovakia and Poland  The United Kingdom presented greater problems  General der Flieger Hellmuth Felmy  commander of Luftflotte 2 in 1939  was charged with devising a plan for an air war over the British Isles  Felmy was convinced that Britain could be defeated through morale bombing  Felmy noted the alleged panic that had broken out in London during the Munich crisis  evidence he believed of British weakness  A second reason was technical  German designers had never solved the issues of the Heinkel He 177A s design difficulties  brought on by the requirement from its inception on 5 November 1937 to have moderate dive bombing capabilities in a 30 meter wingspan class military aircraft  Moreover  Germany did not possess the economic strength and resources to match the later British and American effort of 1943–1944  particularly in large scale mass production of high power output aircraft powerplants  those capable of a maximum output of at least 1 500 kW  2 000 hp  apiece  In addition  the OKL had not foreseen the industrial and military effort strategic bombing would require  By 1939 the Luftwaffe was not much better prepared than its enemies to conduct a strategic bombing campaign  with fatal results during the Battle of Britain   The German rearmament program faced difficulties acquiring raw materials  Germany imported most of its essential materials for rebuilding the Luftwaffe  in particular rubber and aluminium  Petroleum imports were particularly vulnerable to blockade  The Germans pushed for synthetic fuel plants  but still failed to meet demands  In 1937 Germany imported more fuel than it had at the start of the decade  By the summer 1938 only 25% of requirements could be covered  In steel materials  industry was operating at barely 83% and by November 1938 Göring reported the economic situation was serious  The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht  OKW   the overall command for all German military forces  ordered reductions in raw and steel materials for armament production  The figures for reduction were substantial  30% steel  20% copper  47% aluminium and 14% rubber  Under such circumstances  it was not possible for Milch  Udet or Kesselring to produce a formidable strategic bombing force even had they wanted to do so   The development of aircraft was now confined to the production of twin engined medium bombers that required much less material  manpower and aviation production capacity than Wever s  Ural Bombers   German industry could build two medium bombers for one heavy bomber and the RLM would not gamble on developing a heavy bomber which would also take time  Göring remarked   the Führer will not ask how big the bombers there are  but only how many there are   The premature death of Wever  one of the Luftwaffe s finest officers  left the Luftwaffe without a strategic air force during World War II  which eventually proved fatal to the German war effort   The lack of strategic capability should have been apparent much earlier  The Sudeten Crisis highlighted German unprepardness to conduct a strategic air war  although the British and French were in a much weaker position   and Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe be expanded by five times its earlier size  The OKL badly neglected the need for transport aircraft  even in 1943  transport units were described as Kampfgeschwadern zur besonderen Verwendung   Bomber Units on Special Duties   KGzbV   and only grouping them together into dedicated cargo and personnel transport wings  Transportgeschwader  during that year  In March 1938  as the Anschluss was taking place  Göring ordered Felmy to investigate the prospect of air raids against Britain  Felmy concluded it was not possible until bases in Belgium and the Netherlands were obtained and the Luftwaffe had heavy bombers  Fortunately it mattered little  as the British betrayed the Czechs  war was avoided  and the need for long range aircraft did not arise   These failures were not exposed until wartime  In the meantime German designs of mid 1930s origin such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109  Heinkel He 111  Junkers Ju 87 Stuka  and Dornier Do 17  performed very well  All first saw active service in the Condor Legion against Soviet supplied aircraft  The Luftwaffe also quickly realized the days of the biplane fighter were finished  the Heinkel He 51 being switched to service as a trainer  Particularly impressive were the Heinkel and Dornier  which fulfilled the Luftwaffe s requirements for bombers that were faster than 1930s era fighters  many of which were biplanes or strut braced monoplanes   Despite the participation of these aircraft  mainly from 1938 onward   it was the venerable Junkers Ju 52  which soon became the backbone of the Transportgruppen  that made the main contribution  During the Spanish Civil War Hitler remarked   Franco ought to erect a monument to the glory of the Junkers Ju 52  It is the aircraft which the Spanish revolution has to thank for its victory    2 3  Dive bombing  Poor accuracy from level bombers in 1937 led the Luftwaffe to grasp the benefits of dive bombing  The latter could achieve far better accuracy against small mobile tactical targets than heavier  conventional bombers  Range was not a key criterion for these tasks and it was not always feasible for the Army to move heavy artillery over recently captured territory to bombard fortifications or support ground forces when dive bombers could do the job more quickly  Dive bombers  often single engine two man machines  could achieve better results than larger six or seven man aircraft  at a tenth of the cost and four times the accuracy  This led to Ernst Udet championing the dive bomber  particularly the Junkers Ju 87   Udet s  love affair  with dive bombing seriously affected the long term development of the Luftwaffe  especially after General Wever s untimely death  The tactical strike aircraft programs were meant to serve as interim solutions until the next generation of aircraft arrived  In 1936 the Junkers Ju 52 was the backbone of the German bomber fleet  This led to a rush on the part of the RLM to produce the Junkers Ju 86  Heinkel He 111 and Dornier Do 17 before a proper evaluation was made  The Ju 86 was poor while the He 111 showed most promise  The Spanish Civil War convinced Udet  along with limited output from the German munitions industry  that wastage was not acceptable in munition terms  Udet sought to build dive bombing into the Junkers Ju 88 and conveyed the same idea  initiated specifically by the OKL for the Heinkel He 177  approved in early November 1937  In the case of the Ju 88  50 000 modifications had to be made  The weight was increased from seven to twelve tons  This resulted in a speed loss of 200 km h  Udet merely conveyed the OKL s own dive bombing capability request to Ernst Heinkel concerning the He 177  who vehemently opposed such an idea  which ruined its development as a heavy bomber  Göring was not able to rescind the dive bombing requirement for the He 177A until September 1942   2 4  Mobilization  1938–41  By the summer of 1939  the Luftwaffe had nine Jagdgeschwader  fighter wings  mostly equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E  four  Zerstörergeschwader  destroyer wings  equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter  11 Kampfgeschwader  bomber wings  equipped with mainly the Heinkel He 111 and the Dornier Do 17Z  and as it had encountered design difficulties  was just starting to accept the Junkers Ju 88A for service with only a dozen aircraft of the type considered combat ready  and four Sturzkampfgeschwader  dive bomber wings  ready for combat  primarily armed with the iconic Junkers Ju 87B Stuka  The Luftwaffes strength at this time stood at 373 000 personnel  208 000 parachute troops  107 000 in the Flak Corps and 58 000 in the Signals Corps   Aircraft strength was 4 201 operational aircraft  1 191 bombers  361 dive bombers  788 fighters  431 heavy fighters  and 488 transports  Despite deficiencies it was an impressive force   However  even by the spring of 1940  the Luftwaffe still had not mobilized fully  Despite the shortage of raw materials Generalluftzeugmeister Ernst Udet  had increased production through introducing a 10 hour working day for aviation industries and rationalizing of production  During this period 30 Kampfstaffeln and 16 Jagdstaffeln were being raised and equipped  A further five Zerstörergruppen   Destroyer groups   were created  JGr 101  102 126 152 and 176   all equipped with the Bf 110   The Luftwaffe also greatly expanded its aircrew training programs by 42%  to 63 flying schools  These facilities were moved to eastern Germany  away from possible Allied threats  The number of aircrew reached 4 727  an increase of 31%  However  the rush to complete this rapid expansion scheme resulted in the deaths of 997 personnel and another 700 wounded  946 aircraft were also destroyed in these accidents  The number of aircrew completing their training was up to 3 941  The Luftwaffes entire strength was now 2 2 million personnel   In April and May 1941  Udet headed the Luftwaffe delegation inspecting Soviet aviation industry in compliance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact  Udet informed Göring  that Soviet air forces are very strong and technically advanced   Göring decided not to report the facts to Hitler hoping that a surprise attack will quickly destroy Russia  Udet realized that the upcoming war on Russia may cripple Germany  Udet  torn between truth and loyalty  suffered a psychological breakdown and even tried to tell all the truth to Hitler  but Göring told Hitler  that Udet was lying  then took Udet under control by giving him drugs at drinking parties and hunting trips  Udet s drinking and psychological condition became a problem  but Göring used Udet s dependency to manipulate him   3  Luftwaffe organization  3 1  Luftwaffe commanders  Throughout the history of the Third Reich  the Luftwaffe had only two commanders in chief  The first was Hermann Göring  with the second and last being Generalfeldmarschall Robert Ritter von Greim  His appointment as commander in chief of the Luftwaffe was concomitant with his promotion to Generalfeldmarschall  the last German officer in World War II to be promoted to the highest rank  Other officers promoted to the second highest military rank in Germany were Albert Kesselring  Hugo Sperrle  Erhard Milch  and Wolfram von Richthofen   At the end of the war  with Berlin surrounded by the Red Army  Göring sent a telegram to Hitler suggesting he take over leadership of the Reich  Hitler interpreted this as an ultimatum and coup  Hitler ordered his arrest and execution  Göring s SS guards did not carry out the order and he was arrested by the United States Army in Bavaria on 9 May 1945  Göring was prosecuted at the Nuremberg Trials after the war  The indictments were for   Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of a crime against peace  Planning  initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace  War crimes  Crimes against humanity He was found guilty on all four counts and sentenced to death by hanging  He appealed to the court requesting to be shot as a soldier  The court refused  However  Göring defied the sentence and committed suicide by taking potassium cyanide   Sperrle was prosecuted at the OKW Trial  one of the last twelve of the Nuremberg Trials after the war  He was acquitted on all four counts of all charges  He died in Munich in 1953   3 2  Organization and chain of command  At the start of the war the Luftwaffe had four Luftflotten   air fleets    each responsible for roughly a quarter of Germany  As the war progressed more air fleets were created as the areas under German rule expanded  As one example  Luftflotte 5 was created in 1940 to direct operations in Norway and Denmark  and other Luftflotten were created as necessary  Each Luftflotte would contain severalFliegerkorps  Air Corps   Fliegerdivision  Air Division   Jagdkorps  Fighter Corps  Jagddivision  Air Division  or Jagdfliegerführer  Fighter Air Command   Each formations would have attached to it a number of units  usually several Geschwader  but also independent Staffeln and Kampfgruppen  Luftflotten were also responsible for the training aircraft and schools in their operational areas   A Geschwader was commanded by a Geschwaderkommodore  with the rank of either major  Oberstleutnant  lieutenant colonel  or Oberst  colonel   Other  staff  officers within the unit with administrative duties included the adjutant  technical officer  and operations officer  who were usually  though not always  experienced aircrew or pilots still flying on operations  Other specialist staff were navigation  signals and intelligence personnel  A Stabschwarm  headquarters flight  was attached to each Geschwader   Jagdgeschwader  Fighter wings   JG  were single seat day fighter Geschwaders  literally  hunting wings    typically equipped with Bf 109 or Fw 190 aircraft flying in the fighter or fighter bomber roles  with only the later war JG 7 and JG 400 wings using much more advanced aircraft  It consisted of groups  Gruppen   which in turn consisted of Jagdstaffel  fighter squadrons   Hence  Fighter Wing 1 was JG 1  its first Gruppe  group  was I  JG 1  using a Roman numeral for the Gruppe number only  and its first Staffel  squadron  was 1  JG 1  Geschwader strength was usually 120 – 125 aircraft   Each Gruppe was commanded by a Kommandeur  and a Staffel by a Staffelkapitãn  However  these were  appointments   not ranks  within the Luftwaffe  Usually  the Kommodore would hold the rank of Oberstleutnant  lieutenant colonel  or  exceptionally  an Oberst  colonel   Even a Leutnant  second lieutenant  could find himself commanding a Staffel   Similarly  a bomber wing was a Kampfgeschwader  KG   a night fighter wing was a Nachtjagdgeschwader NJG   a dive bomber wing was a Stukageschwader  StG   and units equivalent to those in RAF Coastal Command  with specific responsibilities for coastal patrols and search and rescue duties  were Küstenfliegergruppen  Kü Fl  Gr    Specialist bomber groups were known as Kampfgruppen  KGr   The strength of Geschwader was about 80 – 90 aircraft   4  Spanish Civil War  The Luftwaffes Condor Legion experimented with new doctrine and aircraft during the Spanish Civil War  It helped the Falange under Francisco Franco to defeat the Republican forces  Over 20 000 German airmen gained combat experience that would give the Luftwaffe an important advantage going into the Second World War  One infamous operation was the bombing of Guernica in the Basque country  It is commonly assumed this attack was the result of a  terror doctrine  in Luftwaffe doctrine  The effects of the raids on Guernica and Madrid caused many civilian casualties and a wave of protests in the democracies  It has been suggested that the bombing of Guernica was carried out for military tactical reasons  in support of ground operations  but the town was not directly involved in any fighting at that point in time  It was not until 1942 that the Germans started to develop bombing policy in which civilians were the primary target  although The Blitz on London and many other British cities involved indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas  known as  nuisance raids  which could even involve the machine gunning of civilians and livestock   5  Second World War  When the Second World War began  the Luftwaffe was one of the most technologically advanced air forces in the world  During the Polish Campaign that triggered the war  it established air superiority  and then air supremacy  quickly  It supported German Army  Heer  operations which ended the campaign in five weeks  The Luftwaffe s performance was as the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe had hoped  The Luftwaffe had rendered invaluable support to the army  mopping up pockets of resistance  Göring was delighted with the performance  Command and control problems were experienced  but owing to the flexibility and improvisation of both the army and Luftwaffe  these problems were solved  The Luftwaffe was to have in place a ground to air communication system  which played a vital role in the success of Fall Gelb   In the spring of 1940  the Luftwaffe assisted the Kriegsmarine and Heer in the daring invasion of Norway  Operation Weserübung  Flying in reinforcements and winning air superiority  the Luftwaffe contributed decisively to the German conquest and expulsion of the Western Allies from Scandinavia   In the summer of 1940  the Luftwaffe contributed to the unexpected success in the Battle of France  It helped destroy three Allied Air Forces and secure the defeat of France in just over six weeks  However  during the Battle of Dunkirk despite intense bombing  it could not deliver Göring s promise to destroy the British Expeditionary Force  which escaped to continue the war  During the Battle of Britain  the Luftwaffe  despite causing severe damage to the Royal Air Force s infrastructure and British cities during the subsequent Blitz  did not achieve the air superiority that Hitler demanded for Operation Sea Lion as the invasion was cancelled in December 1940  when Hitler ordered preparations to be made for Operation Barbarossa  the invasion of the Soviet Union  The following spring  the Luftwaffe helped its Axis partner  Italy secure victory in the Balkans Campaign and continued to support the Italians in the Mediterranean  Middle East and African theatres until May 1945   In June 1941  Germany invaded the Soviet Union  The Luftwaffe destroyed thousands of Soviet aircraft  But it failed to destroy the Red Air Force  Due to a lack of Strategic bombers – the very  Ural bombers  that General Wever had asked for six years before – the Luftwaffe could not strike at Soviet production centers regularly or with the needed force  As the war dragged on  the Luftwaffe was eroded in strength  The defeats at the Battle of Stalingrad and Battle of Kursk ensured the gradual decline of the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front   British historian Frederick Taylor asserts that  all sides bombed each other s cities during the war  Half a million Soviet citizens  for example  died from German bombing during the invasion and occupation of Russia  That s roughly equivalent to the number of German citizens who died from Allied raids    Meanwhile  the Luftwaffe continued to defend German–occupied Europe against the growing offensive power of RAF Bomber Command and  starting in the summer of 1942  the steadily building strength of the United States Army Air Forces  The Defence of the Reich campaign gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe s fighter arm  Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket propelled aircraft for bomber destroyer duties  it was overwhelmed by Allied numbers and a lack of trained pilots and fuel  A last ditch attempt  known as Operation Bodenplatte  to win air superiority on 1 January 1945 failed  After the Bodenplatte effort  the Luftwaffe had ceased to be an effective fighting force   6  Omissions and failures  6 1  Mistakes in Command  The lack of aerial defence  The failure of the Luftwaffe in the Defence of the Reich campaign was a result of a number of factors  The Luftwaffe lacked an effective air defence system early in the war  Adolf Hitler s foreign policy had pushed Germany into war before these defences could be fully developed  The Luftwaffe was forced to improvise and construct its defences during the war  The daylight actions over German controlled territory were sparse in 1939–1940  The responsibility of the defence of German air space fell to the Luftgaukommandos  air district commands   The defence systems relied mostly on the Flak arm  The defences were not coordinated and communication was poor  This lack of understanding between the Flak and flying branches of the defence would plague the Luftwaffe throughout the war  Hitler in particular wanted the defence to rest on anti aircraft artillery as it gave the civilian population a  psychological crutch  no matter how ineffective the weapons   Most of the battles fought by the Luftwaffe on the Western Front would be against the RAF s  Circus  raids and the occasional daylight raid into German air space  This was a fortunate position since the Luftwaffe s strategy of focusing its striking power on one front started to unravel with the failure of Operation Barbarossa  the invasion of the Soviet Union  The  peripheral  strategy of the Luftwaffe between 1939–1940 had been to deploy its fighter defences at the edges of Axis occupied territory  with little protecting the inner depths  Moreover the front line units in the West were complaining about the poor numbers and performance of aircraft  Units complained of lack of Zerstörer aircraft with all weather capabilities and the  lack of climbing power of the Bf 109   The Luftwaffe s technical edge was slipping as the only formidable new aircraft in the German arsenal was the Focke Wulf Fw 190  Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milch was to assist Ernst Udet with aircraft production increases and introduction of more modern types of fighter aircraft  However  they explained at a meeting of the Reich Industrial Council on 18 September 1941 that the new next generation aircraft had failed to materialise  and obsolescent types had to be continued to keep up with the growing need for replacements   The buildup of the Jagdwaffe  Fighter Force  was too rapid and its quality suffered  It was not put under a unified command until 1943  which also affected performance  Of the nine Jagdgeschwader fighter wings in existence in 1939  no further units were formed until 1942  and the years of 1940–1941 were wasted  The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe failed to construct a strategy  instead its command style was reactionary  and its measures not as effective without thorough planning  This was particularly apparent with the Fw 190A equipped Sturmbock squadrons which were armed with heavy 20 mm and 30 mm cannon to destroy heavy bombers  to replace the increasingly ineffective twin engined Zerstörer twin engined heavy fighter wings  initially tasked with being the Luftwaffe s primary bomber destroyer forces to repel USAAF daylight raids  This increase in weight affected the performance of the Fw 190 and Bf 109 at a time when the two aircraft were meeting large numbers of equal if not superior Allied types   6 2  Mistakes in development and equipment  In terms of technological development  the failure to develop a long range bomber and capable long range fighters during this period left the Luftwaffe unable to conduct a meaningful  strategic bombing campaign throughout the war  However  Germany at that time suffered from limitations in raw materials such as oil and aluminium  which meant that there were insufficient resources for much beyond a tactical air force  given these circumstances  the Luftwaffe s reliance on tactical mid range  twin engined medium bombers and short range dive bombers was a pragmatic choice of strategy  It might also be argued that the Luftwaffe s Kampfgeschwader medium and heavy bomber wings were perfectly capable of attacking strategic targets  but the lack of capable long range escort fighters — which  in most respects  were what the Zerstörer heavy fighters were meant to be — left the bombers unable to carry out their missions effectively against determined and well organised fighter opposition   The greatest failure for the Kampfgeschwader  however  was being saddled with an aircraft intended to be as big and as apparently capable as any Allied four engined  heavy bomber  – the perpetually troubled Heinkel He 177  condemned through being designed to carry out moderate angle dive bombing missions from the day that the RLM accepted it for production in November 1937  so making it overweight from the start  and mandating design features that meant its  welded together engines   a pair of cumbersome Daimler Benz DB 606  power systems   were prone to catch fire in flight during operational missions over both the Eastern Front and the United Kingdom  Of the three parallel proposals from the Heinkel engineering departments for a  true four engined  version of the A series He 177  only one of them  the He 177B  emerged in the concluding months of 1943  with only three airworthy prototypes produced by early 1944  some three years after the first flights of the Avro Lancaster s own prototypes  the most commonly encountered RAF heavy bomber pounding Germany on strategic night raids from 1942 to the end of the war in Europe   Another failure of procurement and equipment was a lack of a dedicated naval air arm  General Felmy had already expressed a desire to build a naval air arm to support Kriegsmarine operations in the Atlantic and British waters  Britain was dependent on food and raw materials from its Empire and North America  Felmy pressed this case firmly throughout 1938 and 1939  and  on 31 October 1939  Großadmiral Erich Raeder sent a strongly worded letter to Göring in support of such proposals  The early war twin engined Heinkel He 115 floatplane and Dornier Do 18 flying boat were too slow and short ranged  with the then contemporary Blohm & Voss BV 138 trimotor flying boat becoming the Luftwaffe s primary maritime patrol platform  with nearly 300 examples built and capable of up to a 4 300 km  2 670 mi  range from its trio of Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engines  Another Blohm und Voss design of 1940  the enormous six engined Blohm und Voss Bv 222 Wiking maritime patrol flying boat  would see it capable of a 6 800 km  4 200 mile  range at maximum endurance when using higher output versions of the same Jumo 205 powerplants as used by the Bv 138  in later years  The Dornier Do 217 would have been ideal  but suffered production problems  Raeder also complained about the poor standard of aerial torpedoes  although their design was the Kriegsmarine s responsibility  even considering production of the Japanese Type 91 torpedo used at Pearl Harbor as the Luftorpedo LT 850 by August 1942   See Heinkel He 111 torpedo bomber operations   Without specialised naval or maritime patrol aircraft  the Luftwaffe was forced to improvise  The Focke Wulf Fw 200 Condor airliner s airframe – engineered for civilian airliner use – made it unsuitable as a bomber  lacking speed  armour and bomb load capacity  Nevertheless this civilian transport was adapted to the long range reconnaissance and anti shipping roles and  between August 1940 and February 1941  Fw 200s sank 85 vessels for a claimed total of 363 000 Grt  Had the Luftwaffe focused on naval aviation – particularly maritime patrol aircraft with long range  like the aforementioned diesel powered multi engine Blohm & Voss flying boats – Germany might well have been in a position to win the Battle of the Atlantic  However  Raeder and the Navy failed to press for naval air power until the war began  mitigating the Luftwaffe s responsibility  In addition  Göring regarded any other branch of the German military developing its own aviation as an encroachment on his authority and continually frustrated the navy s attempts to build its own airpower   The absence of a strategic bomber force for the Luftwaffe  following General Wever s accidental death in 1936 and the end of the Ural bomber program he fostered before the invasion of Poland  would not be addressed again until the authorization of the Bomber B design competition in July 1939  which sought to replace the medium bomber force with which the Luftwaffe was to begin the war  and the partly achieved Schnellbomber high speed medium bomber concept with more advanced  twin engined high speed bomber aircraft fitted with pairs of relatively  high power  engines of 1 500 kW  2 000 hp  output levels and upwards each as a follow on to the earlier Schnellbomber project  that would also be able to function as shorter range heavy bombers  The spring 1942 Amerika Bomber program also sought to produce useful strategic bomber designs for the Luftwaffe  with their prime design priority being an advanced trans oceanic range capability as the main aim of the project to directly attack the United States from Europe or the Azores  Inevitably  both the Bomber B and Amerika Bomber programs were victims of the continued emphasis of the Wehrmacht s insistence for the Luftwaffe to support the Army as its primary mission  as well as the increasingly devastating results of the RAF Bomber Command at night  and by 1943 the USAAF s Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces  heavy bomber raids by daylight on the German aviation industry  which catastrophically diminished the Third Reich s overall aviation production capacity later in World War II   The RLM s apparent lack of a dedicated  technical tactical  department  that would have directly been in contact with combat pilots to assess their needs for weaponry upgrades and tactical advice  had never been seriously envisioned as a critically ongoing necessity in the planning of the original German air arm  The RLM did have its own Technisches Amt  T Amt  department to handle aviation technology issues  but this was tasked with handling all aviation technology issues in the Third Reich  both military and civilian in nature  and also not known to have ever had any clear and actively administrative and consultative links with the front line forces established for such purposes  On the front line combat side of the issue  and for direct contact with the German aviation firms making the Luftwaffe s warplanes  the Luftwaffe did have its own reasonably effective system of four military aviation test facilities  or Erprobungstellen located at three coastal sites – Peenemünde West  also incorporating a separate facility in nearby Karlshagen   Tarnewitz and Travemünde – and the central inland site of Rechlin  itself first established as a military airfield in late August 1918 by the German Empire  with the four facility system commanded later in World War II by Oberst  Colonel  Edgar Petersen  As a result of the lack of co ordination between the RLM ministry and the OKL  all fighter and bomber development was oriented toward short range aircraft  as they could be produced in greater numbers  rather than quality long range aircraft  something that put the Luftwaffe at a disadvantage as early as the Battle of Britain  Production was also slow  not reaching maximum output until 1944  Production of fighters was not given priority until 1944  Adolf Galland commented that this should have occurred at least a year earlier  Galland also points to the mistakes and challenges made in the development of the Me 262 jet – which included the protracted development time required for its Junkers Jumo 004 jet engines to improve their reliability – meaning that the Me 262A fighter variants could have entered service before the end of 1943 had such challenges been overcome  when the outcome of the air war was still in doubt  from events such as the disastrous losses to the US Eighth Air Force from the  Black Thursday  raid in mid October 1943  Types that were obsolete were kept in production for far too long  in particular the Ju 87 Stuka  and the Bf 109   6 3  Production failures  The failure of German production was evident from the start of the Battle of Britain  By the end of 1940 the Luftwaffe had suffered heavy losses and needed to regroup  Deliveries of new aircraft were insufficient to meet the drain on resources  the Luftwaffe  unlike the RAF  was failing to expand its pilot and aircraft numbers  This was partly owing to production planning failures before the war and the demands of the army  Nevertheless  the German aircraft industry was being outproduced in 1940  In terms of fighter aircraft production  the British exceeded their production plans by 43%  while the Germans remained 40%  behind  target by the summer 1940  In fact German production in fighters fell from 227 to 177 per month between July and September 1940  One of the many reasons for the failure of the Luftwaffe in 1940 was that it did not have the operational and material means to destroy the British aircraft industry   No effort was made to address the low production output of the German aviation industry to support the expected increased attrition rates  The so called  Göring program  envisaged the defeat of the Soviet Union in 1941  Erhard Milch s reforms expanded production rates  In 1941 an average of 981 aircraft  including 311 fighters  were produced each month  In 1942 this rose to 1 296 aircraft of which 434 were fighters  Milch s planned production increases were initially opposed  But in June  he was granted materials for 900 fighters per month as the average output  By the winter of 1941–1942 just 39% of the fighter force was operational and possessed just 60 more combat aircraft than it did in June 1941 despite its increased commitments  Throughout 1942 the Luftwaffe was out produced in fighter aircraft by 250% and in twin engine aircraft by 196%   The appointment of Albert Speer as Minister of Armaments increased production  However the intensification of Allied bombing caused the dispersion of production and prevented an efficient acceleration of expansion  The German aviation production reached about 36 000 combat aircraft for 1944  However by the time this was achieved the Luftwaffe lacked the fuel and trained pilots to make this achievement worth while  The failure to maximize production immediately after the failures in the Soviet Union and North Africa ensured the Luftwaffe s effective defeat in the period of September 1943 – February 1944  Despite the tactical victories won  they failed to achieve a decisive victory  By the time production reached acceptable levels  as so many other factors had for the Luftwaffe – and for the entire Wehrmacht as a whole – late in the war  it was  too little  too late    6 4  Mistakes in pilot selection and training  The bomber arm was given preference and received the  better  pilots  Later  fighter pilot leaders were few in numbers as a result of this  As with the late shift to fighter production  the Luftwaffe pilot schools did not give the fighter pilot schools preference soon enough  The Luftwaffe  the OKW argued  was still an offensive weapon  and its primary focus was on producing bomber pilots  This attitude prevailed until the second half of 1943  During the Defence of the Reich campaign in 1943 and 1944  there were not enough commissioned fighter pilots and leaders to meet attrition rates  as the need arose to replace aircrew  as attrition rates increased   the quality of pilot training deteriorated rapidly  Later this was made worse by fuel shortages for pilot training  Overall this meant a fall on training on operational types  formation flying  gunnery training  combat training and a total lack of instrument training   6 5  Mistakes in leadership  At the beginning of the war commanders were replaced with younger commanders too quickly  These younger commanders had to learn  in the field  rather than entering a post fully qualified  Training of formation leaders was not systematical until 1943  which was far too late  with the Luftwaffe already stretched  The Luftwaffe thus lacked a cadre of Staff officers to set up  man  and pass on experience   Moreover  Luftwaffe leadership from the start poached the training command  which undermined its ability to replace losses  while also planning for  short sharp campaigns   which did not pertain  Moreover  no plans were laid for night fighters  In fact  when protests were raised  Jeschonnek himself said   First we ve got to beat Russia  then we can start training    7  Luftwaffe ground forces  One of the unique characteristics of the Luftwaffe  as opposed to other independent air forces  was the possession of an organic paratrooper force called Fallschirmjäger  These were established in 1938  They saw action in their proper role during 1940–1941  most notably in the capture of the Belgian army fortress at the Battle of Fort Eben Emael and the Battle for The Hague in May 1940  and during the Battle of Crete in May 1941  However  more than 4 000 Fallschirmjäger were killed during the Crete operation  Afterwards  although continuing to be trained in parachute delivery  paratroopers were only used in a parachute role for smaller scale operations  such as the successful rescue of Benito Mussolini  the then deposed dictator of Italy in 1943  Fallschirmjägerformations were then used as crack foot infantry in all theatres of the war   During 1942 surplus Luftwaffe personnel was used to form the Luftwaffe Field Divisions  standard infantry divisions that were used chiefly as rear echelon units to free up front line troops  From 1943  the Luftwaffe also had an armoured paratroop division called Fallschirm Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring  which was expanded to a Panzerkorps in 1944   8  War crimes  Throughout the war civilians or prisoners were used as human guinea pigs in testing Luftwaffe equipment  It is unclear whether these tests were carried out by Luftwaffe personnel or on the orders of OKL  These illegal tests are classified as war crimes and were carried out on the Luftwaffe s behalf   8 1  Human experimentation in military aviation  In 1941  experiments with the intent of discovering means to prevent and treat hypothermia were carried out  Freezing hypothermia experiments were conducted for the Nazi high command to simulate the conditions the armies suffered on the Eastern Front  as the German forces were ill prepared for the cold weather they encountered  A number of crews were also lost to hypothermia during the Battle of Britain when planes ran out of fuel or were shot down and landed in the English Channel  The principal locales for the experiments were Dachau and Auschwitz  Dr Sigmund Rascher  an SS doctor based at Dachau  reported directly to Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler and publicised the results of his freezing experiments at the 1942 medical conference entitled  Medical Problems Arising from Sea and Winter   Approximately 100 people are reported to have died as a result of these experiments   In early 1942  prisoners at Dachau concentration camp were used by Rascher in experiments to perfect ejection seats at high altitudes  A low pressure chamber containing these prisoners was used to simulate conditions at altitudes of up to 20 000 m  66 000 ft   It was rumoured that Rascher performed vivisections on the brains of victims who survived the initial experiment  Of the 200 subjects  80 died outright  and the others were executed   9  See also  Organization of the Luftwaffe  1933–1945   Military Ranks of the Luftwaffe
