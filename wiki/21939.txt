The National Security Agency  NSA  is a United States intelligence agency responsible for global monitoring  collection  decoding  translation and analysis of information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes   a discipline known as Signals intelligence  SIGINT   NSA is also charged with protection of U S  government communications and information systems against penetration and network warfare  The agency is authorized to accomplish its mission through clandestine means  among which are bugging electronic systems and allegedly engaging in sabotage through subversive software   Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II  it was officially formed as the NSA by Harry S  Truman in 1952  Since then  it has become one of the largest of U S  intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget  operating as part of the Department of Defense and simultaneously reporting to the Director of National Intelligence   Unlike the Defense Intelligence Agency  DIA  and the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA   both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage  the NSA has no authority to conduct human source intelligence gathering  although it is often portrayed doing so in popular culture  Instead  the NSA is entrusted with coordination and deconfliction of SIGINT components of otherwise non SIGINT government organizations  which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities without the approval of the NSA via the Defense Secretary  As part of these streamlining responsibilities  the agency has a co located organization called the Central Security Service  CSS   which was created to facilitate cooperation between NSA and other U S  military cryptanalysis components  Additionally  the NSA Director simultaneously serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and as Chief of the Central Security Service   NSA surveillance has been a matter of political controversy on several occasions  such as its spying on prominent anti Vietnam war leaders or economic espionage  In 2013  the extent of the NSA s secret surveillance programs was revealed to the public by Edward Snowden  According to the leaked documents  the NSA intercepts the communications of over a billion people worldwide and tracks the movement of hundreds of millions of people using cellphones  It has also created or maintained security vulnerabilities in most software and encryption  leaving the majority of the Internet susceptible to cyber attacks from the NSA and other parties  Internationally  in addition to the various data sharing concerns that persist  research has pointed to the NSA s ability to surveil the domestic internet traffic of foreign countries through  boomerang routing    1  History  1 1  Army predecessor  The origins of the National Security Agency can be traced back to April 28  1917  three weeks after the U S  Congress declared war on Germany in World War I  A code and cipher decryption unit was established as the Cable and Telegraph Section which was also known as the Cipher Bureau and Military Intelligence Branch  Section 8  MI 8   It was headquartered in Washington  D C  and was part of the war effort under the executive branch without direct Congressional authorization  During the course of the war it was relocated in the army s organizational chart several times  On July 5  1917  Herbert O  Yardley was assigned to head the unit  At that point  the unit consisted of Yardley and two civilian clerks  It absorbed the navy s cryptoanalysis functions in July 1918  World War I ended on November 11  1918  and MI 8 moved to New York City on May 20  1919  where it continued intelligence activities as the Code Compilation Company under the direction of Yardley   1 2  Black Chamber  MI 8 also operated the so called  Black Chamber   The Black Chamber was located on East 37th Street in Manhattan  Its purpose was to crack the communications codes of foreign governments  Jointly supported by the State Department and the War Department  the chamber persuaded Western Union  the largest U S  telegram company  to allow government officials to monitor private communications passing through the company’s wires   Other  Black Chambers  were also found in Europe  They were established by the French and British governments to read the letters of targeted individuals  employing a variety of techniques to surreptitiously open  copy  and reseal correspondence before forwarding it to unsuspecting recipients   Despite the American Black Chamber s initial successes  it was shut down in 1929 by U S  Secretary of State Henry L  Stimson  who defended his decision by stating   Gentlemen do not read each other s mail    1 3  World War II and its aftermath  During World War II  the Signal Security Agency  SSA  was created to intercept and decipher the communications of the Axis powers  When the war ended  the SSA was reorganized as the Army Security Agency  ASA   and it was placed under the leadership of the Director of Military Intelligence   On May 20  1949  all cryptologic activities were centralized under a national organization called the Armed Forces Security Agency  AFSA   This organization was originally established within the U S  Department of Defense under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  The AFSA was tasked to direct Department of Defense communications and electronic intelligence activities  except those of U S  military intelligence units  However  the AFSA was unable to centralize communications intelligence and failed to coordinate with civilian agencies that shared its interests such as the Department of State  Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   In December 1951  President Harry S  Truman ordered a panel to investigate how AFSA had failed to achieve its goals  The results of the investigation led to improvements and its redesignation as the National Security Agency   The agency was formally established by Truman in a memorandum of October 24  1952  that revised National Security Council Intelligence Directive  NSCID  9  Since President Truman s memo was a classified document  the existence of the NSA was not known to the public at that time  Due to its ultra secrecy the U S  intelligence community referred to the NSA as  No Such Agency    1 4  Vietnam War  In the 1960s  the NSA played a key role in expanding America s commitment to the Vietnam War by providing evidence of a North Vietnamese attack on the American destroyer during the Gulf of Tonkin incident   A secret operation code named  MINARET  was set up by the NSA to monitor the phone communications of Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker  as well as major civil rights leaders including Dr  Martin Luther King  and prominent U S  journalists and athletes who criticized the Vietnam War  However the project turned out to be controversial  and an internal review by the NSA concluded that its Minaret program was  disreputable if not outright illegal    1 5  Church Committee hearings  In the aftermath of the Watergate Scandal  a congressional hearing in 1975 led by Sen  Frank Church revealed that the NSA  in collaboration with Britain’s SIGINT intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters  GCHQ   had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti Vietnam war leaders such as Jane Fonda and Dr  Benjamin Spock  Following the resignation of President Richard Nixon  there were several investigations of suspected misuse of FBI  CIA and NSA facilities  Senator Frank Church uncovered previously unknown activity  such as a CIA plot  ordered by the administration of President John F  Kennedy  to assassinate Fidel Castro  The investigation also uncovered NSA s wiretaps on targeted American citizens   After the Church Committee hearings  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 was passed into law  This was designed to limit the practice of mass surveillance in the United States   1 6  From 1980s to 1990s  In 1986  the NSA intercepted the communications of the Libyan government during the immediate aftermath of the Berlin discotheque bombing  The White House asserted that the NSA interception had provided  irrefutable  evidence that Libya was behind the bombing  which U S  President Ronald Reagan cited as a justification for the 1986 United States bombing of Libya   In 1999  a multi year investigation by the European Parliament highlighted the NSA s role in economic espionage in a report entitled  Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information   That year  the NSA founded the NSA Hall of Honor  a memorial at the National Cryptologic Museum in Fort Meade  Maryland  The memorial is a   tribute to the pioneers and heroes who have made significant and long lasting contributions to American cryptology   NSA employees must be retired for more than fifteen years to qualify for the memorial   1 7  War on Terror  In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks  the NSA created new IT systems to deal with the flood of information from new technologies like the internet and cellphones  ThinThread contained advanced data mining capabilities  It also had a  privacy mechanism   surveillance was stored encrypted  decryption required a warrant  The research done under this program may have contributed to the technology used in later systems  ThinThread was cancelled when Michael Hayden chose Trailblazer  which did not include ThinThread s privacy system   Trailblazer Project ramped up in 2002  SAIC  Boeing  CSC  IBM  and Litton worked on it  Some NSA whistleblowers complained internally about major problems surrounding Trailblazer  This led to investigations by Congress and the NSA and DoD Inspectors General  The project was cancelled in early 2004  it was late  over budget  and didn t do what it was supposed to do  The Baltimore Sun ran articles about this in 2006–07  The government then raided the whistleblowers  houses  One of them  Thomas Drake  was charged with violating in 2010 in an unusual use of espionage law  He and his defenders claim that he was actually being persecuted for challenging the Trailblazer Project  In 2011  all 10 original charges against Drake were dropped   Turbulence started in 2005  It was developed in small  inexpensive  test  pieces rather than one grand plan like Trailblazer  It also included offensive cyber warfare capabilities  like injecting malware into remote computers  Congress criticized Turbulence in 2007 for having similar bureaucratic problems as Trailblazer  It was to be a realization of information processing at higher speeds in cyberspace   1 8  Global surveillance disclosures  The massive extent of the NSA s spying  both foreign and domestic  was revealed to the public in a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents beginning in June 2013  Most of the disclosures were leaked by former NSA contractor  Edward Snowden   1 8 1  Scope of surveillance  It was revealed that the NSA intercepts telephone and internet communications of over a billion people worldwide  seeking information on terrorism as well as foreign politics  economics and  commercial secrets   In a declassified document it was revealed that 17 835 phone lines were on an improperly permitted  alert list  from 2006 to 2009 in breach of compliance  which tagged these phone lines for daily monitoring  Eleven percent of these monitored phone lines met the agency s legal standard for  reasonably articulable suspicion  RAS    A dedicated unit of the NSA locates targets for the CIA for extrajudicial assassination in the Middle East  The NSA has also spied extensively on the European Union  the United Nations and numerous governments including allies and trading partners in Europe  South America and Asia   The NSA tracks the locations of hundreds of millions of cellphones per day  allowing them to map people s movements and relationships in detail  It reportedly has access to all communications made via Google  Microsoft  Facebook  Yahoo  YouTube  AOL  Skype  Apple and Paltalk  and collects hundreds of millions of contact lists from personal email and instant messaging accounts each year  It has also managed to weaken much of the encryption used on the Internet  by collaborating with  coercing or otherwise infiltrating numerous technology companies   so that the majority of Internet privacy is now vulnerable to the NSA and other attackers   Domestically  the NSA collects and stores metadata records of phone calls  including over 120 million US Verizon subscribers as well as internet communications  relying on a secret interpretation of the Patriot Act whereby the entirety of US communications may be considered  relevant  to a terrorism investigation if it is expected that even a tiny minority may relate to terrorism  The NSA supplies foreign intercepts to the DEA  IRS and other law enforcement agencies  who use these to initiate criminal investigations  Federal agents are then instructed to  recreate  the investigative trail via parallel construction   The NSA also spies on influential Muslims to obtain information that could be used to discredit them  such as their use of pornography  The targets  both domestic and abroad  are not suspected of any crime but hold religious or political views deemed  radical  by the NSA   According to a report in The Washington Post in July 2014  relying on information furnished by Snowden  90% of those placed under surveillance in the U S  are ordinary Americans  and are not the intended targets  The newspaper said it had examined documents including emails  message texts  and online accounts  that support the claim   1 8 2  Legal accountability  Despite President Obama s claims that these programs have congressional oversight  members of Congress were unaware of the existence of these NSA programs or the secret interpretation of the Patriot Act  and have consistently been denied access to basic information about them  Obama has also claimed that there are legal checks in place to prevent inappropriate access of data and that there have been no examples of abuse  however  the secret FISC court charged with regulating the NSA s activities is  according to its chief judge  incapable of investigating or verifying how often the NSA breaks even its own secret rules  It has since been reported that the NSA violated its own rules on data access thousands of times a year  many of these violations involving large scale data interceptions  and that NSA officers have even used data intercepts to spy on love interests  The NSA has  generally disregarded the special rules for disseminating United States person information  by illegally sharing its intercepts with other law enforcement agencies  A March 2009 opinion of the FISC court  released by court order  states that protocols restricting data queries had been  so frequently and systemically violated that it can be fairly said that this critical element of the overall     regime has never functioned effectively   In 2011 the same court noted that the  volume and nature  of the NSA s bulk foreign internet intercepts was  fundamentally different from what the court had been led to believe   Email contact lists  including those of US citizens  are collected at numerous foreign locations to work around the illegality of doing so on US soil   Legal opinions on the NSA s bulk collection program have differed  In mid December  2013  U S  District Court Judge Richard Leon ruled that the  almost Orwellian  program likely violates the Constitution  and wrote   I cannot imagine a more  indiscriminate  and  arbitrary invasion  than this systematic and high tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval  Surely  such a program infringes on  that degree of privacy  that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment  Indeed  I have little doubt that the author of our Constitution  James Madison  who cautioned us to beware  the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power   would be aghast    Later that month  U S  District Judge William Pauley ruled that the NSA’s collection of telephone records is legal and valuable in the fight against terrorism  In his opinion  he wrote   a bulk telephony metadata collection program  is  a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data  and noted that a similar collection of data prior to 9 11 might have prevented the attack   An October 2014 United Nations report condemned mass surveillance by the United States and other countries as violating multiple international treaties and conventions that guarantee core privacy rights   1 8 3  Official responses  On March 20  2013 the Director of National Intelligence  Lieutenant General James Clapper  testified before Congress that the NSA does not wittingly collect any kind of data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans  but he retracted this in June after details of the PRISM program were published  and stated instead that meta data of phone and internet traffic are collected  but no actual message contents  This was corroborated by the NSA Director  General Keith Alexander  before it was revealed that the XKeyscore program collects the contents of millions of emails from US citizens without warrant  as well as  nearly everything a user does on the Internet   Alexander later admitted that  content  is collected  but stated that it is simply stored and never analyzed or searched unless there is  a nexus to al Qaida or other terrorist groups    Regarding the necessity of these NSA programs  Alexander stated on June 27 that the NSA s bulk phone and Internet intercepts had been instrumental in preventing 54 terrorist  events   including 13 in the US  and in all but one of these cases had provided the initial tip to  unravel the threat stream   On July 31 NSA Deputy Director John Inglis conceded to the Senate that these intercepts had not been vital in stopping any terrorist attacks  but were  close  to vital in identifying and convicting four San Diego men for sending US$8 930 to Al Shabaab  a militia that conducts terrorism in Somalia   The U S  government has aggressively sought to dismiss and challenge Fourth Amendment cases raised against it  and has granted retroactive immunity to ISPs and telecoms participating in domestic surveillance  The U S  military has acknowledged blocking access to parts of The Guardian website for thousands of defense personnel across the country  and blocking the entire Guardian website for personnel stationed throughout Afghanistan  the Middle East  and South Asia   2  Organizational structure  The NSA is led by the Director of the National Security Agency  DIRNSA   who also serves as Chief of the Central Security Service  CHCSS  and Commander of the United States Cyber Command  USCYBERCOM  and is the highest ranking military official of these organizations  He is assisted by a Deputy Director  who is the highest ranking civilian within the NSA CSS   NSA also has an Inspector General  head of the Office of the Inspector General  OIG   a General Counsel  head of the Office of the General Counsel  OGC  and a Director of Compliance  who is head of the Office of the Director of Compliance  ODOC    Unlike other intelligence organizations such as CIA or DIA  NSA has always been particularly reticent concerning its internal organizational structure   As of the mid 1990s  the National Security Agency was organized into five Directorates   The Operations Directorate  which was responsible for SIGINT collection and processing   The Technology and Systems Directorate  which develops new technologies for SIGINT collection and processing   The Information Systems Security Directorate  which was responsible for NSA s communications and information security missions   The Plans  Policy and Programs Directorate  which provided staff support and general direction for the Agency   The Support Services Directorate  which provided logistical and administrative support activities  Each of these directorates consisted of several groups or elements  designated by a letter  There were for example the A Group  which was responsible for all SIGINT operations against the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe  and G Group  which was responsible for SIGINT related to all non communist countries  These groups were divided in units designated by an additional number  like unit A5 for breaking Soviet codes  and G6  being the office for the Middle East  North Africa  Cuba  Central and South America   2 1  Structure  NSA has about a dozen directorates  which are designated by a letter  although not all of them are publicly known  The directorates are divided in divisions and units starting with the letter of the parent directorate  followed by a number for the division  the sub unit or a sub sub unit  New information about NSA units was revealed in top secret documents leaked by Edward Snowden since June 2013   The main elements of the organizational structure of the NSA are   F   Directorate only known from unit F6  the Special Collection Service  SCS   which is a joint program created by CIA and NSA in 1978 to facilitate clandestine activities such as bugging computers throughout the world  using the expertise of both agencies   G   Directorate only known from unit G112  the office that manages the Senior Span platform  attached to the U2 spy planes   I   Information Assurance Directorate  IAD   which ensures availability  integrity  authentication  confidentiality  and non repudiation of national security and telecommunications and information systems  national security systems    J   Directorate only known from unit J2  the Cryptologic Intelligence Unit  L   Installation and Logistics  M   Human Resources  Q   Security and Counterintelligence  R   Research Directorate  which conducts research on signals intelligence and on information assurance for the U S  Government   S   Signals Intelligence Directorate  SID   which is responsible for the collection  analysis  production and dissemination of signals intelligence  This directorate is led by a director and a deputy director  The SID consists of the following divisions   S1   Customer Relations  S2   Analysis and Production Centers  with the following so called Product Lines   S2A  South Asia  S2B  China and Korea  S2C  International Security  S2E  Middle East Asia  S2F  International Crime  S2G  Counter proliferation  S2H  Russia  S2I  Counter terrorism  S2J  Weapons and Space  S2T  Current Threats  S3   Data Acquisition  with these divisions for the main collection programs   S31   Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services  CES   S32   Tailored Access Operations  TAO   which hacks into foreign computers to conduct cyber espionage and reportedly is  the largest and arguably the most important component of the NSA s huge Signal Intelligence  SIGINT  Directorate  consisting of over 1 000 military and civilian computer hackers  intelligence analysts  targeting specialists  computer hardware and software designers  and electrical engineers    S33   Global Access Operations  GAO   which is responsible for intercepts from satellites and other international SIGINT platforms  A tool which details and maps the information collected by this unit is code named Boundless Informant   S34   Collections Strategies and Requirements Center  S35   Special Source Operations  SSO   which is responsible for domestic and compartmented collection programs  like for example the PRISM program  Special Source Operations is also mentioned in connection to the FAIRVIEW collection program   T   Technical Directorate  TD   Directorate for Education and Training  Directorate for Corporate Leadership  Foreign Affairs Directorate  which acts as liaison with foreign intelligence services  counter intelligence centers and the UKUSA partners   Acquisitions and Procurement Directorate In the year 2000  a leadership team was formed  consisting of the Director  the Deputy Director and the Directors of the Signals Intelligence  SID   the Information Assurance  IAD  and the Technical Directorate  TD   The chiefs of other main NSA divisions became associate directors of the senior leadership team   After president George W  Bush initiated the President s Surveillance Program  PSP  in 2001  the NSA created a 24 hour Metadata Analysis Center  MAC   followed in 2004 by the Advanced Analysis Division  AAD   with the mission of analyzing content  internet metadata and telephone metadata  Both units were part of the Signals Intelligence Directorate   There s also an office of Information Sharing Services  ISS   led by a chief and a deputy chief   2 2  Watch centers  The NSA maintains at least two watch centers   National Security Operations Center  NSOC   which is the NSA s current operations center and focal point for time sensitive SIGINT reporting for the United States SIGINT System  USSS   This center was established in 1968 as the National SIGINT Watch Center  NSWC  and renamed into National SIGINT Operations Center  NSOC  in 1973  This  nerve center of the NSA  got its current name in 1996   NSA CSS Threat Operations Center  NTOC   which is the primary NSA CSS partner for Department of Homeland Security response to cyber incidents  The NTOC establishes real time network awareness and threat characterization capabilities to forecast  alert  and attribute malicious activity and enable the coordination of Computer Network Operations  The NTOC was established in 2004 as a joint Information Assurance and Signals Intelligence project   2 3  Employees  The number of NSA employees is officially classified but there are several sources providing estimates  In 1961  NSA had 59 000 military and civilian employees  which grew to 93 067 in 1969  of which 19 300 worked at the headquarters at Fort Meade  In the early 1980s NSA had roughly 50 000 military and civilian personnel  By 1989 this number had grown again to 75 000  of which 25 000 worked at the NSA headquarters  Between 1990 and 1995 the NSA s budget and workforce were cut by one third  which led to a substantial loss of experience   In 2012  the NSA said more than 30 000 employees worked at Ft  Meade and other facilities  In 2012  John C  Inglis  the deputy director  said that the total number of NSA employees is  somewhere between 37 000 and one billion  as a joke  and stated that the agency is  probably the biggest employer of introverts   In 2013 Der Spiegel stated that the NSA had 40 000 employees  More widely  it has been described as the world s largest single employer of mathematicians  Some NSA employees form part of the workforce of the National Reconnaissance Office  NRO   the agency that provides the NSA with satellite signals intelligence   As of 2013 about 1 000 system administrators work for the NSA   2 3 1  Security issues  The NSA received criticism early on in 1960 after two agents had defected to the Soviet Union  Investigations by the House Un American Activities Committee and a special subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee revealed severe cases of ignorance in personnel security regulations  prompting the former personnel director and the director of security to step down and leading to the adoption of stricter security practices  Nonetheless  security breaches reoccurred only a year later when in an issue of Izvestia of July 23  1963  a former NSA employee published several cryptologic secrets   The very same day  an NSA clerk messenger committed suicide as ongoing investigations disclosed that he had sold secret information to the Soviets on a regular basis  The reluctance of Congressional houses to look into these affairs had prompted a journalist to write  If a similar series of tragic blunders occurred in any ordinary agency of Government an aroused public would insist that those responsible be officially censured  demoted  or fired   David Kahn criticized the NSA s tactics of concealing its doings as smug and the Congress  blind faith in the agency s right doing as shortsighted  and pointed out the necessity of surveillance by the Congress to prevent abuse of power   Edward Snowden s leaking of PRISM in 2013 caused the NSA to institute a  two man rule  where two system administrators are required to be present when one accesses certain sensitive information  Snowden claims he suggested such a rule in 2009   2 3 1 1  Polygraphing  The NSA conducts polygraph tests of employees  For new employees  the tests are meant to discover enemy spies who are applying to the NSA and to uncover any information that could make an applicant pliant to coercion  As part of the latter  historically EPQs or  embarrassing personal questions  about sexual behavior had been included in the NSA polygraph  The NSA also conducts five year periodic reinvestigation polygraphs of employees  focusing on counterintelligence programs  In addition the NSA conducts aperiodic polygraph investigations in order to find spies and leakers  those who refuse to take them may receive  termination of employment   according to a 1982 memorandum from the director of the NSA   There are also  special access examination  polygraphs for employees who wish to work in highly sensitive areas  and those polygraphs cover counterintelligence questions and some questions about behavior  NSA s brochure states that the average test length is between two and four hours  A 1983 report of the Office of Technology Assessment stated that  It appears that the NSA  National Security Agency   and possibly CIA  use the polygraph not to determine deception or truthfulness per se  but as a technique of interrogation to encourage admissions   Sometimes applicants in the polygraph process confess to committing felonies such as murder  rape  and selling of illegal drugs  Between 1974 and 1979  of the 20 511 job applicants who took polygraph tests  695  3 4%  confessed to previous felony crimes  almost all of those crimes had been undetected   In 2010 the NSA produced a video explaining its polygraph process  The video  ten minutes long  is titled  The Truth About the Polygraph  and was posted to the website of the Defense Security Service  Jeff Stein of The Washington Post said that the video portrays  various applicants  or actors playing them    it’s not clear    describing everything bad they had heard about the test  the implication being that none of it is true   AntiPolygraph org argues that the NSA produced video omits some information about the polygraph process  it produced a video responding to the NSA video  George Maschke  the founder of the website  accused the NSA polygraph video of being  Orwellian    After Edward Snowden revealed his identity in 2013  the NSA began requiring polygraphing of employees once per quarter   2 3 2  Arbitrary firing  The number of exemptions from legal requirements has been criticized  When in 1964 the Congress was hearing a bill giving the director of the NSA the power to fire at will any employee  the Washington Post wrote   This is the very definition of arbitrariness  It means that an employee could be discharged and disgraced on the basis of anonymous allegations without the slightest opportunity to defend himself   Yet  the bill was accepted by an overwhelming majority   2 4  Insignia and memorials  The heraldic insignia of NSA consists of an eagle inside a circle  grasping a key in its talons  The eagle represents the agency s national mission  Its breast features a shield with bands of red and white  taken from the Great Seal of the United States and representing Congress  The key is taken from the emblem of Saint Peter and represents security   When the NSA was created  the agency had no emblem and used that of the Department of Defense  The agency adopted its first of two emblems in 1963  The current NSA insignia has been in use since 1965  when then Director  LTG Marshall S  Carter  USA  ordered the creation of a device to represent the agency   The NSA s flag consists of the agency s seal on a light blue background   Crews associated with NSA missions have been involved in a number of dangerous and deadly situations  The USS Liberty incident in 1967 and USS Pueblo incident in 1968 are examples of the losses endured during the Cold War   The National Security Agency Central Security Service Cryptologic Memorial honors and remembers the fallen personnel  both military and civilian  of these intelligence missions  It is made of black granite  and has 171 names  as of 2013  carved into it  It is located at NSA headquarters  A tradition of declassifying the stories of the fallen was begun in 2001   3  Facilities  3 1  Headquarters  Headquarters for the National Security Agency is located at in Fort George G  Meade  Maryland  although it is separate from other compounds and agencies that are based within this same military installation  Ft  Meade is about southwest of Baltimore  and northeast of Washington  DC  The NSA has its own exit off Maryland Route 295 South labeled  NSA Employees Only   The exit may only be used by people with the proper clearances  and security vehicles parked along the road guard the entrance   NSA is the largest employer in the U S  state of Maryland  and two thirds of its personnel work at Ft  Meade  Built on of Ft  Meade s   the site has 1 300 buildings and an estimated 18 000 parking spaces   The main NSA headquarters and operations building is what James Bamford  author of Body of Secrets  describes as  a modern boxy structure  that appears similar to  any stylish office building   The building is covered with one way dark glass  which is lined with copper shielding in order to prevent espionage by trapping in signals and sounds  It contains   or more than   of floor space  Bamford said that the U S  Capitol  could easily fit inside it four times over    The facility has over 100 watchposts  one of them being the visitor control center  a two story area that serves as the entrance  At the entrance  a white pentagonal structure  visitor badges are issued to visitors and security clearances of employees are checked  The visitor center includes a painting of the NSA seal   The OPS2A building  the tallest building in the NSA complex and the location of much of the agency s operations directorate  is accessible from the visitor center  Bamford described it as a  dark glass Rubik s Cube   The facility s  red corridor  houses non security operations such as concessions and the drug store  The name refers to the  red badge  which is worn by someone without a security clearance  The NSA headquarters includes a cafeteria  a credit union  ticket counters for airlines and entertainment  a barbershop  and a bank  NSA headquarters has its own post office  fire department  and police force   The employees at the NSA headquarters reside in various places in the Baltimore Washington area  including Annapolis  Baltimore  and Columbia in Maryland and the District of Columbia  including the Georgetown community   3 1 1  Power consumption  Following a major power outage in 2000  in 2003 and in follow ups through 2007  The Baltimore Sun reported that the NSA was at risk of electrical overload because of insufficient internal electrical infrastructure at Fort Meade to support the amount of equipment being installed  This problem was apparently recognized in the 1990s but not made a priority  and  now the agency s ability to keep its operations going is threatened    Baltimore Gas & Electric  BGE  now Constellation Energy  provided NSA with 65 to 75 megawatts at Ft  Meade in 2007  and expected that an increase of 10 to 15 megawatts would be needed later that year  In 2011  NSA at Ft  Meade was Maryland s largest consumer of power  In 2007  as BGE s largest customer  NSA bought as much electricity as Annapolis  the capital city of Maryland   One estimate put the potential for power consumption by the new Utah Data Center at 40 million per year   3 1 2  History of headquarters  When the agency was established  its headquarters and cryptographic center were in the Naval Security Station in Washington  D C   The COMINT functions were located in Arlington Hall in Northern Virginia  which served as the headquarters of the U S  Army s cryptographic operations  Because the Soviet Union had detonated a nuclear bomb and because the facilities were crowded  the federal government wanted to move several agencies  including the AFSA NSA  A planning committee considered Fort Knox  but Fort Meade  Maryland  was ultimately chosen as NSA headquarters because it was far enough away from Washington  D C  in case of a nuclear strike and was close enough so its employees would not have to move their families   Construction of additional buildings began after the agency occupied buildings at Ft  Meade in the late 1950s  which they soon outgrew  In 1963 the new headquarters building  nine stories tall  opened  NSA workers referred to the building as the  Headquarters Building  and since the NSA management occupied the top floor  workers used  Ninth Floor  to refer to their leaders  COMSEC remained in Washington  D C   until its new building was completed in 1968  In September 1986  the Operations 2A and 2B buildings  both copper shielded to prevent eavesdropping  opened with a dedication by President Ronald Reagan  The four NSA buildings became known as the  Big Four   The NSA director moved to 2B when it opened   3 1 3  Computing  In 1995  The Baltimore Sun reported that the NSA is the owner of the single largest group of supercomputers   NSA held a groundbreaking ceremony at Ft  Meade in May 2013 for its High Performance Computing Center 2  expected to open in 2016  Called Site M  the center has a 150 megawatt power substation  14 administrative buildings and 10 parking garages  It cost 3 2 billion and covers   The center is and initially uses 60 megawatts of electricity   Increments II and III are expected to be completed by 2030  and would quadruple the space  covering with 60 buildings and 40 parking garages  Defense contractors are also establishing or expanding cybersecurity facilities near the NSA and around the Washington metropolitan area   3 2  Other U S  facilities  As of 2012  NSA collected intelligence from four geostationary satellites  Satellite receivers were at Roaring Creek Station in Catawissa  Pennsylvania and Salt Creek Station in Arbuckle  California  It operated ten to twenty taps on U S  telecom switches  NSA had installations in several U S  states and from them observed intercepts from Europe  the Middle East  North Africa  Latin America  and Asia   NSA had facilities at Friendship Annex  FANX  in Linthicum  Maryland  which is a 20 to 25 minute drive from Ft  Meade  the Aerospace Data Facility at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora outside Denver  Colorado  NSA Texas in the Texas Cryptology Center at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio  Texas  NSA Georgia at Fort Gordon in Augusta  Georgia  NSA Hawaii in Honolulu  the Multiprogram Research Facility in Oak Ridge  Tennessee  and elsewhere   On January 6  2011 a groundbreaking ceremony was held to begin construction on NSA s first Comprehensive National Cyber security Initiative  CNCI  Data Center  known as the  Utah Data Center  for short  The $1 5B data center is being built at Camp Williams  Utah  located south of Salt Lake City  and will help support the agency s National Cyber security Initiative  It is expected to be operational by September 2013   In 2009  to protect its assets and to access more electricity  NSA sought to decentralize and expand its existing facilities in Ft  Meade and Menwith Hill  the latter expansion expected to be completed by 2015   The Yakima Herald Republic cited Bamford  saying that many of NSA s bases for its Echelon program were a legacy system  using outdated  1990s technology  In 2004  NSA closed its operations at Bad Aibling Station  Field Station 81  in Bad Aibling  Germany  In 2012  NSA began to move some of its operations at Yakima Research Station  Yakima Training Center  in Washington state to Colorado  planning to leave Yakima closed  As of 2013  NSA also intended to close operations at Sugar Grove  West Virginia   3 3  International stations  Following the signing in 1946–1956 of the UKUSA Agreement between the United States  United Kingdom  Canada  Australia and New Zealand  who then cooperated on signals intelligence and Echelon  NSA stations were built at GCHQ Bude in Morwenstow  United Kingdom  Geraldton  Pine Gap and Shoal Bay  Australia  Leitrim and Ottawa  Canada  Misawa  Japan  and Waihopai and Tangimoana  New Zealand   NSA operates RAF Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire  United Kingdom  which was  according to BBC News in 2007  the largest electronic monitoring station in the world  Planned in 1954  and opened in 1960  the base covered in 1999   The agency s European Cryptologic Center  ECC   with 240 employees in 2011  is headquartered at a US military compound in Griesheim  near Frankfurt in Germany  A 2011 NSA report indicates that the ECC is responsible for the  largest analysis and productivity in Europe  and focusses on various priorities  including Africa  Europe  the Middle East and counterterrorism operations   In 2013  a new Consolidated Intelligence Center  also to be used by NSA  is being built at the headquarters of the United States Army Europe in Wiesbaden  Germany  NSA s partnership with Bundesnachrichtendienst  BND   the German foreign intelligence service  was confirmed by BND president Gerhard Schindler   4  Operations  4 1  Mission  NSA s eavesdropping mission includes radio broadcasting  both from various organizations and individuals  the Internet  telephone calls  and other intercepted forms of communication  Its secure communications mission includes military  diplomatic  and all other sensitive  confidential or secret government communications   According to the Washington Post    e very day  collection systems at the National Security Agency intercept and store 1 7 billion e mails  phone calls and other types of communications  The NSA sorts a fraction of those into 70 separate databases    Because of its listening task  NSA CSS has been heavily involved in cryptanalytic research  continuing the work of predecessor agencies which had broken many World War II codes and ciphers  see  for instance  Purple  Venona project  and JN 25    In 2004  NSA Central Security Service and the National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  agreed to expand NSA Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education Program   As part of the National Security Presidential Directive 54 Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23  NSPD 54   signed on January 8  2008 by President Bush  the NSA became the lead agency to monitor and protect all of the federal government s computer networks from cyber terrorism   4 2  Echelon  Echelon was created in the incubator of the Cold War  Today it is a legacy system  and several NSA stations are closing   NSA CSS  in combination with the equivalent agencies in the United Kingdom  Government Communications Headquarters   Canada  Communications Security Establishment   Australia  Defence Signals Directorate   and New Zealand  Government Communications Security Bureau   otherwise known as the UKUSA group  was reported to be in command of the operation of the so called Echelon system  Its capabilities were suspected to include the ability to monitor a large proportion of the world s transmitted civilian telephone  fax and data traffic   During the early 1970s  the first of what became more than eight large satellite communications dishes were installed at Menwith Hill  Investigative journalist Duncan Campbell reported in 1988 on the Echelon surveillance program  an extension of the UKUSA Agreement on global signals intelligence SIGINT  and detailed how the eavesdropping operations worked  In November 3  1999 the BBC reported that they had confirmation from the Australian Government of the existence of a powerful  global spying network  code named Echelon  that could  eavesdrop on every single phone call  fax or e mail  anywhere on the planet  with Britain and the United States as the chief protagonists  They confirmed that Menwith Hill was  linked directly to the headquarters of the US National Security Agency  NSA  at Fort Meade in Maryland    NSA s United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18  USSID 18  strictly prohibited the interception or collection of information about      U S  persons  entities  corporations or organizations      without explicit written legal permission from the United States Attorney General when the subject is located abroad  or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court when within U S  borders  Alleged Echelon related activities  including its use for motives other than national security  including political and industrial espionage  received criticism from countries outside the UKUSA alliance   4 3  Data mining  The Real Time Regional Gateway was a data collection program introduced in 2005 in Iraq by NSA during the Iraq War  It consisted of gathering all Iraqi electronic communication  storing it  then searching and otherwise analyzing it  It was effective in providing information about Iraqi insurgents who had eluded less comprehensive techniques  Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian believes that the  collect it all  strategy introduced by NSA director Alexander shows that  the NSA s goal is to collect  monitor and store every telephone and internet communication  worldwide  The NSA is also involved in planning to blackmail people with  SEXINT   intelligence gained about a potential target s sexual activity and preferences  Those targeted had not committed any apparent crime nor were charged with one   The NSA began the PRISM electronic surveillance and data mining program in 2007  PRISM gathers communications data on foreign targets from nine major U S  internet based communication service providers  Microsoft  Yahoo  Google  Facebook  PalTalk  AOL  Skype  YouTube and Apple  Data gathered include email  video and voice chat  videos  photos  VoIP chats such as Skype  and file transfers  Another program  Boundless Informant  employs big data databases  cloud computing technology  and Free and Open Source Software  FOSS  to analyze data collected worldwide by the NSA  including that gathered by way of the PRISM program   4 4  Encryption  In 2013  reporters uncovered a secret memo that claims the NSA created and pushed for the adoption of encryption standards that contained built in vulnerabilities in 2006 to the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST   and the International Organization for Standardization  aka ISO   This memo appears to give credence to previous speculation by cryptographers at Microsoft Research  Edward Snowden claims that the NSA often bypasses encryption altogether by lifting information before it is encrypted or after it is decrypted   XKeyscore rules  as specified in a file xkeyscorerules100 txt  sourced by German TV stations NDR and WDR  who claim to have excerpts from its source code  reveal that the NSA tracks users of privacy enhancing software tools  including Tor  the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  CSAIL  in Cambridge  Massachusetts  and readers of the Linux Journal   5  Domestic activity  NSA s mission  as set forth in Executive Order 12333  is to collect information that constitutes  foreign intelligence or counterintelligence  while not  acquiring information concerning the domestic activities of United States persons   NSA has declared that it relies on the FBI to collect information on foreign intelligence activities within the borders of the United States  while confining its own activities within the United States to the embassies and missions of foreign nations   NSA s domestic surveillance activities are limited by the requirements imposed by the Fourth Amendment to the U S  Constitution  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for example held in October 2011  citing multiple Supreme Court precedents  that the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures applies to the contents of all communications  whatever the means  because  a person s private communications are akin to personal papers   However  these protections do not apply to non U S  persons located outside of U S  borders  so the NSA s foreign surveillance efforts are subject to far fewer limitations under U S  law  The specific requirements for domestic surveillance operations are contained in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978  FISA   which does not extend protection to non U S  citizens located outside of U S  territory   These activities  especially the publicly acknowledged domestic telephone tapping and call database programs  have prompted questions about the extent of the NSA s activities and concerns about threats to privacy and the rule of law   5 1  George W  Bush administration  5 1 1  Warrantless wiretaps  On December 16  2005  The New York Times reported that  under White House pressure and with an executive order from President George W  Bush  the National Security Agency  in an attempt to thwart terrorism  had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country  without obtaining warrants from the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  a secret court created for that purpose under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA    One such surveillance program  authorized by the U S  Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush  was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U S  Army 513th Military Intelligence Brigade  NSA relayed telephone  including cell phone  conversations obtained from ground  airborne  and satellite monitoring stations to various U S  Army Signal Intelligence Officers  including the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion  Conversations of citizens of the U S  were intercepted  along with those of other nations   Proponents of the surveillance program claim that the President has executive authority to order such action  arguing that laws such as FISA are overridden by the President s Constitutional powers  In addition  some argued that FISA was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute  the Authorization for Use of Military Force  although the Supreme Court s ruling in Hamdan v  Rumsfeld deprecates this view  In the August 2006 case ACLU v  NSA  U S  District Court Judge Anna Diggs Taylor concluded that NSA s warrantless surveillance program was both illegal and unconstitutional  On July 6  2007 the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the decision on the grounds that the ACLU lacked standing to bring the suit   On January 17  2006  the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit  CCR v  Bush  against the George W  Bush Presidency  The lawsuit challenged the National Security Agency s  NSA s  surveillance of people within the U S   including the interception of CCR emails without securing a warrant first   In September 2008  the Electronic Frontier Foundation  EFF  filed a class action lawsuit against the NSA and several high ranking officials of the Bush administration  charging an  illegal and unconstitutional program of dragnet communications surveillance   based on documentation provided by former AT&T technician Mark Klein   5 1 2  AT&T Internet monitoring  In May 2006  Mark Klein  a former AT&T employee  alleged that his company had cooperated with NSA in installing Narus hardware to replace the FBI Carnivore program  to monitor network communications including traffic between American citizens   5 1 3  Data mining  NSA was reported in 2008 to use its computing capability to analyze  transactional  data that it regularly acquires from other government agencies  which gather it under their own jurisdictional authorities  As part of this effort  NSA now monitors huge volumes of records of domestic email data  web addresses from Internet searches  bank transfers  credit card transactions  travel records  and telephone data  according to current and former intelligence officials interviewed by The Wall Street Journal  The sender  recipient  and subject line of emails can be included  but the content of the messages or of phone calls are not   A 2013 advisory group for the Obama administration  seeking to reform NSA spying programs following the revelations of documents released by Edward J  Snowden  mentioned in  Recommendation 30  on page 37      that the National Security Council staff should manage an interagency process to review on a regular basis the activities of the US Government regarding attacks that exploit a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application   Retired cyber security expert Richard A  Clarke was a group member and stated on 11 April that NSA had no advance knowledge of Heartbleed   5 1 4  Illegally obtained evidence  In August 2013 it was revealed that a 2005 IRS training document showed that NSA intelligence intercepts and wiretaps  both foreign and domestic  were being supplied to the Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA  and Internal Revenue Service  IRS  and were illegally used to launch criminal investigations of US citizens  Law enforcement agents were directed to conceal how the investigations began and recreate an apparently legal investigative trail by re obtaining the same evidence by other means   5 2  Domestic surveillance under Barack Obama  In the months leading to April 2009  the NSA intercepted the communications of American citizens  including a Congressman  although the Justice Department believed that the interception was unintentional  The Justice Department then took action to correct the issues and bring the program into compliance with existing laws  United States Attorney General Eric Holder resumed the program according to his understanding of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendment of 2008  without explaining what had occurred   On April 25  2013  the NSA obtained a court order requiring Verizon s Business Network Services to provide metadata on all calls in its system to the NSA  on an ongoing daily basis  for a three month period  as reported by The Guardian on June 6  2013  This information includes  the numbers of both parties on a call     location data  call duration  unique identifiers  and the time and duration of all calls  but not   t he contents of the conversation itself   The order relies on the so called  business records  provision of the Patriot Act   In August 2013  following the Snowden leaks  new details about the NSA s data mining activity were revealed  Reportedly  the majority of emails into or out of the United States are captured at  selected communications links  and automatically analyzed for keywords or other  selectors   Emails that do not match are deleted   In order to support its facial recognition program  the NSA is intercepting  millions of images per day    5 2 1  Polling  Polls conducted in June 2013 found divided results among Americans regarding NSA s secret data collection  Rasmussen Reports found that 59% of Americans disapprove  Gallup found that 53% disapprove  and Pew found that 56% are in favor of NSA data collection   5 3  Terrorist Attacks prevented by Domestic Surveillance  5 3 1  2009 New York City Subway bomb plot  According to General Keith Alexander  the director of the NSA  in September 2009 the NSA prevented Najibullah Zazi and his friends from carrying out a terrorist attack  The NSA tagged Zazi as a possible threat because he was contacting people affiliated with terrorist activity through emails  which the NSA was able to obtain through one of PRISM s dragnets  The NSA tipped off the FBI  which began a program called Operation High Rise  Operation High Rise discovered that Zazi was planning to suicide bomb the New York City subway  Zazi called off the attacks after receiving a tip about law enforcement inquiries and was later arrested   6  International activity  6 1  Telecommunication records  Edward Snowden revealed in June 2013 that between 8 February and 8 March 2013 NSA collected about 124 8 billion telephone data items and 97 1 billion computer data items throughout the world  including in Germany  United Kingdom and France  NSA made 70 3 million recordings of French citizens  telephone data from 10 December 2012 to 8 January 2013   6 2  Software backdoors  6 2 1  Linux kernel  Linus Torvalds  the founder of Linux kernel  joked during a LinuxCon keynote on 18 September 2013 that the NSA  who are the founder of SELinux  wanted a backdoor in the kernel  However later  Linus  father  a Member of the European Parliament  MEP   revealed that the NSA actually did this   6 2 2  Microsoft Windows   NSAKEY was a variable name discovered in Microsoft s Windows NT 4 Service Pack 5  which had been released unstripped of its symbolic debugging data  in August 1999 by Andrew D  Fernandes of Cryptonym Corporation  That variable contained a 1024 bit public key   6 2 3  IBM Notes  IBM Notes was the first widely adopted software product to use public key cryptography for client–server and server–server authentication and for encryption of data  Until US laws regulating encryption were changed in 2000  IBM and Lotus were prohibited from exporting versions of Notes that supported symmetric encryption keys that were longer than 40 bits  In 1997  Lotus negotiated an agreement with the NSA that allowed export of a version that supported stronger keys with 64 bits  but 24 of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a  workload reduction factor  for the NSA  This strengthened the protection for users of Notes outside the US against private sector industrial espionage  but not against spying by the US government   6 3  Boomerang routing  While it is assumed that foreign transmissions terminating in the U S   such as a non U S  citizen accessing a U S  website  subject non U S  citizens to NSA surveillance  recent research into boomerang routing has raised new concerns about the NSA s ability to surveil the domestic internet traffic of foreign countries  Boomerang routing occurs when an internet transmission that originates and terminates in a single country transits another  Research at the University of Toronto has suggested that approximately 25% of Canadian domestic traffic may be subject to NSA surveillance activities as a result of the boomerang routing of Canadian internet service providers   6 4  Hardware implanting  A document included in NSA files released with Glenn Greenwald’s book No Place to Hide details how the agency’s Tailored Access Operations  TAO  and other NSA units gain access to hardware  They intercept routers  servers and other network hardware being shipped to organizations targeted for surveillance and install covert implant firmware onto them before they are delivered  This was described by an NSA manager as  some of the most productive operations in TAO because they preposition access points into hard target networks around the world    7  Role in scientific research and development  NSA has been involved in debates about public policy  both indirectly as a behind the scenes adviser to other departments  and directly during and after Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman s directorship  NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the export of cryptography in the United States  Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996   Its secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas  including the design of specialized communications hardware and software  production of dedicated semiconductors  at the Ft  Meade chip fabrication plant   and advanced cryptography research  For 50 years  NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in house  but from the 1990s until about 2003  when the U S  Congress curtailed the practice   the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment   7 1  Data Encryption Standard  NSA was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard  DES   a standard and public block cipher algorithm used by the U S  government and banking community  During the development of DES by IBM in the 1970s  NSA recommended changes to some details of the design  There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required  including speculation that a critical component—the so called S boxes—had been altered to insert a  backdoor  and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power  It has since been observed that the S boxes in DES are particularly resilient against differential cryptanalysis  a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s  but which was known to the IBM DES team   The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed NSA s involvement  and concluded that while the agency had provided some assistance  it had not tampered with the design  In late 2009 NSA declassified information stating that  NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except brute force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables  called S boxes  Conversely  NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 64 to 48 bits  Ultimately they compromised on a 56 bit key    7 2  Advanced Encryption Standard  The involvement of NSA in the selection of a successor to DES  the Advanced Encryption Standard  AES   was limited to hardware performance testing  see AES competition   NSA has subsequently certified AES for protection of classified information    when used in NSA approved systems   7 3  NSA encryption systems  The NSA is responsible for the encryption related components in these legacy systems   FNBDT Future Narrow Band Digital Terminal  KL 7 ADONIS off line rotor encryption machine  post WWII – 1980s   KW 26 ROMULUS electronic in line teletypewriter encryptor  1960s–1980s   KW 37 JASON fleet broadcast encryptor  1960s–1990s   KY 57 VINSON tactical radio voice encryptor  KG 84 Dedicated Data Encryption Decryption  STU III secure telephone unit  phased out by the STE The NSA oversees encyption in following systems which are in use today   EKMS Electronic Key Management System  Fortezza encryption based on portable crypto token in PC Card format  SINCGARS tactical radio with cryptographically controlled frequency hopping  STE secure terminal equipment  TACLANE product line by General Dynamics C4 Systems The NSA has specified Suite A and Suite B cryptographic algorithm suites to be used in U S  government systems  the Suite B algorithms are a subset of those previously specified by NIST and are expected to serve for most information protection purposes  while the Suite A algorithms are secret and are intended for especially high levels of protection   7 4  SHA  The widely used SHA 1 and SHA 2 hash functions were designed by NSA  SHA 1 is a slight modification of the weaker SHA 0 algorithm  also designed by NSA in 1993  This small modification was suggested by NSA two years later  with no justification other than the fact that it provides additional security  An attack for SHA 0 that does not apply to the revised algorithm was indeed found between 1998 and 2005 by academic cryptographers  Because of weaknesses and key length restrictions in SHA 1  NIST deprecates its use for digital signatures  and approves only the newer SHA 2 algorithms for such applications from 2013 on   A new hash standard  SHA 3  has recently been selected through the competition concluded October 2  2012 with the selection of Keccak as the algorithm  The process to select SHA 3 was similar to the one held in choosing the AES  but some doubts have been cast over it  since fundamental modifications have been made to Keccak in order to turn it into a standard  These changes potentially undermine the cryptanalysis performed during the competition and reduce the security levels of the algorithm   7 5  Dual EC DRBG random number generator  NSA promoted the inclusion of a random number generator called Dual EC DRBG in the U S  National Institute of Standards and Technology s 2007 guidelines  This led to speculation of a backdoor which would allow NSA access to data encrypted by systems using that pseudo random number generator   This is now deemed to be plausible based on the fact that the output of the next iterations of the PRNG can provably be determined if the relation between two internal elliptic curve points is known  Both NIST and RSA are now officially recommending against the use of this PRNG   7 6  Clipper chip  Because of concerns that widespread use of strong cryptography would hamper government use of wiretaps  NSA proposed the concept of key escrow in 1993 and introduced the Clipper chip that would offer stronger protection than DES but would allow access to encrypted data by authorized law enforcement officials  The proposal was strongly opposed and key escrow requirements ultimately went nowhere  However  NSA s Fortezza hardware based encryption cards  created for the Clipper project  are still used within government  and NSA ultimately declassified and published the design of the Skipjack cipher used on the cards   7 7  Perfect Citizen  Perfect Citizen is a program to perform vulnerability assessment by the NSA on U S  critical infrastructure  It was originally reported to be a program to develop a system of sensors to detect cyber attacks on critical infrastructure computer networks in both the private and public sector through a network monitoring system named Einstein  It is funded by the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative and thus far Raytheon has received a contract for up to $100 million for the initial stage   7 8  Academic research  NSA has invested many millions of dollars in academic research under grant code prefix MDA904  resulting in over 3 000 papers  as of 2007 10 11   NSA CSS has  at times  attempted to restrict the publication of academic research into cryptography  for example  the Khufu and Khafre block ciphers were voluntarily withheld in response to an NSA request to do so  In response to a FOIA lawsuit  in 2013 the NSA released the 643 page research paper titled   Untangling the Web  A Guide to Internet Research    written and compiled by NSA employees to assist other NSA workers in searching for information of interest to the agency on the public Internet   7 9  Patents  NSA has the ability to file for a patent from the U S  Patent and Trademark Office under gag order  Unlike normal patents  these are not revealed to the public and do not expire  However  if the Patent Office receives an application for an identical patent from a third party  they will reveal NSA s patent and officially grant it to NSA for the full term on that date   One of NSA s published patents describes a method of geographically locating an individual computer site in an Internet like network  based on the latency of multiple network connections  Although no public patent exists  NSA is reported to have used a similar locating technology called trilateralization that allows real time tracking of an individual’s location  including altitude from ground level  using data obtained from cellphone towers   8  NSANet  NSA s Intranet   NSANet stands for National Security Agency Network and is the official NSA intranet  It is a classified network  for information up to the level of TS SCI to support the use and sharing of intelligence data between NSA and the signals intelligence agencies of the four other nations of the Five Eyes partnership  The management of NSANet has been delegated to the Central Security Service Texas  CSSTEXAS    NSANet is a highly secured computer network consisting of fiber optic and satellite communication channels which are almost completely separated from the public internet  The network allows NSA personnel and civilian and military intelligence analysts anywhere in the world to have access to the agency s systems and databases  This access is tightly controlled and monitored  For example  every keystroke is logged  activities are audited at random and downloading and printing of documents from NSANet are recorded   In 1998  NSANet  along with NIPRNET and SIPRNET  had  significant problems with poor search capabilities  unorganized data and old information   In 2004  the network was reported to have used over twenty commercial off the shelf operating systems  Some universities that do highly sensitive research are allowed to connect to it   The thousands of Top Secret internal NSA documents that were taken by Edward Snowden in 2013 were stored in  a file sharing location on the NSA s intranet site  so they could easily be read online by NSA personnel  Everyone with a TS SCI clearance had access to these documents and as a system administrator  Snowden was responsible for moving accidentally misplaced highly sensitive documents to more secure storage locations   9  National Computer Security Center  The DoD Computer Security Center was founded in 1981 and renamed the National Computer Security Center  NCSC  in 1985  NCSC was responsible for computer security throughout the federal government  NCSC was part of NSA  and during the late 1980s and the 1990s  NSA and NCSC published Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria in a six foot high Rainbow Series of books that detailed trusted computing and network platform specifications  The Rainbow books were replaced by the Common Criteria  however  in the early 2000s   On July 18  2013  Greenwald said that Snowden held  detailed blueprints of how the NSA does what they do   thereby sparking fresh controversy   10  Legality  10 1  Legality in US  In the United States  there has been legal controversy over what signal intelligence can be used for and how much freedom the National Security Agency has to use signal intelligence  Therefore  the government has recently changed how it uses and collects certain types of data  specifically phone records  President Barack Obama has asked lawyers and his national security team to look at the tactics that are being used by the NSA  President Obama made a speech on January 17  2014 where he defended the national security measures  including the NSA  and their intentions for keeping the country safe through surveillance  He said that it is difficult to determine where the line should be drawn between what is too much surveillance and how much is needed for national security because technology is ever changing and evolving  therefore  the laws cannot keep up with the rapid advancements   However  President Obama did make some changes to national security regulations and how much data can be collected and surveyed  The first thing that was added  was more presidential directive and oversight so that privacy and basic rights are not violated  The president would look over requests on behalf of American citizens to make sure that their personal privacy is not violated by the data that is being requested  Secondly  surveillance tactics and procedures are becoming more public  including over 40 rulings of the FISC that have been declassified  Thirdly  further protections are being placed on activities that are justified under Section 702  such as the ability to retain  search and use data collected in investigations  which allows the NSA to monitor and intercept interaction of targets overseas  Finally  national security letters  which are secret requests for information that the FBI uses in their investigations  are becoming less secretive  The secrecy of the information requested will not be definite and will terminate after a set time if future secrecy is not required  Concerning the bulk surveillance of American s phone records  President Obama also ordered a transition from bulk surveillance under Section 215 to a new policy that will eliminate un necessary bulk collection of metadata   The details of this transition are still being worked out  One of the proposals being investigated is an outside third party source holding the bulk metadata  where the NSA would then need to ask permission to access the data if it is relevant to national security  President Obama emphasized that the government is not spying on ordinary citizens  but rather working to keep America safe   11  See also  Five Eyes Canadian   American   Australian   British   New Zealander
