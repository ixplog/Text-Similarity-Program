Mythology can refer either to the collected myths of a group of peopletheir body of stories which they tell to explain nature  history  and customsor to the study of such myths   As a collection of such stories  mythology is an important feature of every culture  Various origins for myths have been proposed  ranging from personification of natural phenomena to truthful or hyperbolic accounts of historical events  to explanations of existing ritual  Although the term is complicated by its implicit condescension  mythologizing is not just an ancient or primitive practice  as shown by contemporary mythopoeia such as urban legends and the expansive fictional mythoi created by fantasy novels and Japanese manga  A culture s collective mythology helps convey belonging  shared and religious experience  behavioral models  and moral and practical lessons   As the study of myth  mythology dates back to antiquity  Rationalists in ancient Greece and China devised allegorical interpretations of their traditional stories  Rival classifications of the Greek myths by Euhemerus  Plato s Phaedrus  and Sallustius were developed by the Neoplatonists and revived by Renaissance mythographers  Nineteenth century comparative mythology reinterpreted myth as a primitive and failed counterpart of science  E  B  Tylor   a  disease of language   Max Müller   or a misinterpretation of magical ritual  James Frazer    Some  recent  approaches have rejected a conflict between the value of myth and rational thought  often viewing myths  rather than being merely inaccurate historical accounts  as expressions for understanding general psychological  cultural or societal truths   1  Etymology  The English term mythology predates the word myth by centuries  It appeared in the 15th century  borrowed whole from Middle French mythologie  Both terms translated the subject of Fulgentius s 5th century Mythologiæ  which was concerned with the explication of Greek and Roman stories about their gods  Although the African author Fulgentius s conflation with the contemporary African saint Fulgentius is now questioned  the Mythologiæ explicitly treated its subject matter as allegories requiring interpretation and not as true events   The word mythología    appears in Plato but was a general term for  fiction  or  story telling  of any kind  combining mỹthos     narrative  fiction   and  logía     discourse  able to speak about     From Lydgate until the 17th or 18th century   mythology  was similarly used to mean a moral  a fable  an allegory  or a parable  From its earliest use in reference to a collection of traditional stories or beliefs  it has implied the falsehood of the stories being described  remaining associated with sacred tales of the Greeks and Romans  though  it came to be applied by analogy with similar bodies of traditional stories among other polytheistic cultures around the world  The Greek loanword mythos  pl  mythoi  and Latinate mythus  pl  mythi  both appeared in English before the first attestation of myth in 1830   2  Terminology  In present use   mythology  usually refers to the collected myths of a group of people but may also mean the study of such myths  For example  Greek mythology  Roman mythology and Hittite mythology all describe the body of myths retold among those cultures  but landscape mythology describes the study of landscape used across various totemistic peoples  Alan Dundes defined myth as a sacred narrative which explains how the world and humanity evolved into their present form   a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society   Bruce Lincoln defined it as  ideology in narrative form   Many scholars in other fields use the term  myth  in somewhat different ways  in a very broad sense  the word can refer to any traditional story or any popular misconception or imaginary entity  Because of this pejorative sense  some opt to return to the earlier mythos  although its use was similarly pejorative and it now more commonly refers to its Aristotlean sense as a  plot point  or to a collective mythology  as in the worldbuilding of H P  Lovecraft   Mythology is now often sharply distinguished from didactic literature such as fables  but its relationship with other traditional stories such as legends and folktales is much more nebulous  The main characters in myths are usually gods  demigods  or supernatural humans  while legends generally feature humans as their main characters  but many exceptions or combinations exist  as in the Iliad  Odyssey  and Aeneid  Myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests and closely linked to religion or spirituality  In fact  many societies group their myths  legends  and history together  considering myths to be true accounts of their remote past  Creation myths  particularly  take place in a primordial age when the world had not yet achieved its current form  but other myths explain how the society s customs  institutions and taboos were established and sanctified  A separate space is created for folktales  which are not considered true by the people who tell them  As stories spread to other cultures or as faiths change  however  myths can come to be considered folktales  sometimes even to the point of being reinterpreted as one  its divine characters recast as humans or as demihumans such as giants  elves  and faeries   3  Origins  3 1  Euhemerism  One theory claims that myths are distorted accounts of real historical events  According to this theory  storytellers repeatedly elaborated upon historical accounts until the figures in those accounts gained the status of gods  For example  one might argue that the myth of the wind god Aeolus evolved from a historical account of a king who taught his people to use sails and interpret the winds  Herodotus  5th century BC  and Prodicus made claims of this kind  This theory is named  euhemerism  after the mythologist Euhemerus  c 320 BC   who suggested that the Greek gods developed from legends about human beings   3 2  Allegory  Some theories propose that myths began as allegories  According to one theory  myths began as allegories for natural phenomena  Apollo represents the sun  Poseidon represents water  and so on  According to another theory  myths began as allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts  Athena represents wise judgment  Aphrodite represents desire  etc  The 19th century Sanskritist Max Müller supported an allegorical theory of myth  He believed that myths began as allegorical descriptions of nature  but gradually came to be interpreted literally  for example  a poetic description of the sea as  raging  was eventually taken literally  and the sea was then thought of as a raging god   3 3  Personification  Some thinkers believe that myths resulted from the personification of inanimate objects and forces  According to these thinkers  the ancients worshipped natural phenomena such as fire and air  gradually coming to describe them as gods  For example  according to the theory of mythopoeic thought  the ancients tended to view things as persons  not as mere objects  thus  they described natural events as acts of personal gods  thus giving rise to myths   3 4  Myth ritual theory  According to the myth ritual theory  the existence of myth is tied to ritual  In its most extreme form  this theory claims that myths arose to explain rituals  This claim was first put forward by the biblical scholar William Robertson Smith  According to Smith  people begin performing rituals for some reason that is not related to myth  later  after they have forgotten the original reason for a ritual  they try to account for the ritual by inventing a myth and claiming that the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth  The anthropologist James Frazer had a similar theory  Frazer believed that primitive man starts out with a belief in magical laws  later  when man begins to lose faith in magic  he invents myths about gods and claims that his formerly magical rituals are religious rituals intended to appease the gods   4  Functions of myth  Mircea Eliade argued that one of the foremost functions of myth is to establish models for behavior and that myths may also provide a religious experience  By telling or reenacting myths  members of traditional societies detach themselves from the present and return to the mythical age  thereby bringing themselves closer to the divine   Lauri Honko asserts that  in some cases  a society will reenact a myth in an attempt to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age  For example  it will reenact the healing performed by a god at the beginning of time in order to heal someone in the present  Similarly  Roland Barthes argues that modern culture explores religious experience  Because it is not the job of science to define human morality  a religious experience is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past  which is in contrast with the technological present   Joseph Campbell writes   In the long view of the history of mankind  four essential functions of mythology can be discerned  The first and most distinctive – vitalizing all – is that of eliciting and supporting a sense of awe before the mystery of being    The second function of mythology is to render a cosmology  an image of the universe that will support and be supported by this sense of awe before the mystery of the presence and the presence of a mystery    A third function of mythology is to support the current social order  to integrate the individual organically with his group    The fourth function of mythology is to initiate the individual into the order of realities of his own psyche  guiding him toward his own spiritual enrichment and realization    In a later work Campbell explains the relationship of myth to civilisation   And yet the history of civilisation is not one of harmony   Campbell gives his answer to the question  what is the function of myth today  in episode 2 of Bill Moyers s The Power of Myth series   5  Study of mythology  Historically  the important approaches to the study of mythology have been those of Vico  Schelling  Schiller  Jung  Freud  Lévy Bruhl  Lévi Strauss  Frye  the Soviet school  and the Myth and Ritual School   5 1  Pre modern theories  The critical interpretation of myth goes back as far as the Presocratics  Euhemerus was one of the most important pre modern mythologists  He interpreted myths as accounts of actual historical events  distorted over many retellings  Sallustius  for example  divides myths into five categories – theological  physical  or concerning natural laws   animastic  or concerning soul   material and mixed  This last being those myths which show the interaction between two or more of the previous categories and which  he says  are particularly used in initiations   To ones who are even trying to change content of the myth according to probability would be found criticism in Plato Phaedrus  229d   in which Socrates says that it is the province of one who is  vehemently curious and laborious  and not entirely happy          Although Plato famously condemned poetic myth when discussing the education of the young in the Republic  primarily on the grounds that there was a danger that the young and uneducated might take the stories of Gods and heroes literally  nevertheless he constantly refers to myths of all kinds throughout his writings  As Platonism developed in the phases commonly called  middle Platonism  and neoplatonism  such writers as Plutarch  Porphyry  Proclus  Olympiodorus and Damascius wrote explicitly about the symbolic interpretation of traditional and Orphic myths  Interest in polytheistic mythology revived in the Renaissance  with early works on mythography appearing in the 16th century  such as the Theologia mythologica  1532  Myths are not the same as fables  legends  folktales  fairy tales  anecdotes  or fiction  but the concepts may overlap  Notably  during the nineteenth century period of Romanticism  folktales and fairy tales were perceived as eroded fragments of earlier mythology  famously by the Brothers Grimm and Elias Lönnrot   Mythological themes are also very often consciously employed in literature  beginning with Homer  The resulting work may expressly refer to a mythological background without itself being part of a body of myths  Cupid and Psyche   The medieval romance in particular plays with this process of turning myth into literature  Euhemerism refers to the process of rationalization of myths  putting themes formerly imbued with mythological qualities into pragmatic contexts  for example following a cultural or religious paradigm shift  notably the re interpretation of pagan mythology following Christianization    Conversely  historical and literary material may acquire mythological qualities over time  for example the Matter of Britain referring to the legendary history of Great Britain  especially those focused on King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table  and the Matter of France  based on historical events of the fifth and eighth centuries  respectively  were first made into epic poetry and became partly mythological over the following centuries   Conscious generation  of mythology has been termed mythopoeia by J  R  R  Tolkien 16   and was notoriously also suggested  very separately  by Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg   5 2  19th century theories  The first scholarly theories of myth appeared during the second half of the 19th century  In general  these 19th century theories framed myth as a failed or obsolete mode of thought  often by interpreting myth as the primitive counterpart of modern science   For example  E  B  Tylor interpreted myth as an attempt at a literal explanation for natural phenomena  unable to conceive of impersonal natural laws  early man tried to explain natural phenomena by attributing souls to inanimate objects  giving rise to animism  According to Tylor  human thought evolves through various stages  starting with mythological ideas and gradually progressing to scientific ideas  Not all scholars — not even all 19th century scholars — have agreed with this view  For example  Lucien Lévy Bruhl claimed that  the primitive mentality is a condition of the human mind  and not a stage in its historical development    Max Müller called myth a  disease of language   He speculated that myths arose due to the lack of abstract nouns and neuter gender in ancient languages  anthropomorphic figures of speech  necessary in such languages  were eventually taken literally  leading to the idea that natural phenomena were conscious beings  gods   The anthropologist James Frazer saw myths as a misinterpretation of magical rituals  which were themselves based on a mistaken idea of natural law  According to Frazer  man begins with an unfounded belief in impersonal magical laws  When he realizes that his applications of these laws don t work  he gives up his belief in natural law  in favor of a belief in personal gods controlling nature — thus giving rise to religious myths  Meanwhile  man continues practicing formerly magical rituals through force of habit  reinterpreting them as reenactments of mythical events  Finally  Frazer contends  man realizes that nature does follow natural laws  but now he discovers their true nature through science  Here  again  science makes myth obsolete  as Frazer puts it  man progresses  from magic through religion to science    Robert Segal asserts that by pitting mythical thought against modern scientific thought  such theories implied that modern man must abandon myth   5 3  20th century theories  Many 20th century theories of myth rejected the 19th century theories  opposition of myth and science  In general   twentieth century theories have tended to see myth as almost anything but an outdated counterpart to science  …  Consequently  moderns are not obliged to abandon myth for science    Swiss psychologist Carl Jung  1873–1961  tried to understand the psychology behind world myths  Jung asserted that all humans share certain innate unconscious psychological forces  which he called archetypes  Jung believed that the similarities between the myths from different cultures reveals the existence of these universal archetypes   Joseph Campbell believed that there were two different orders of mythology  myths that  are metaphorical of spiritual potentiality in the human being   and myths  that have to do with specific societies    Joseph Campbell s major work is The Masks of God I IV  In the first volume  Primitive Mythology  he outlines clearly his intention   In his fourth volume however he coins the phrase  creative mythology  which he explains as   Claude Lévi Strauss believed that myths reflect patterns in the mind and interpreted those patterns more as fixed mental structures — specifically  pairs of opposites  i e  good evil  compassionate callous  — than as unconscious feelings or urges   In his appendix to Myths  Dreams and Mysteries  and in The Myth of the Eternal Return  Mircea Eliade attributed modern man’s anxieties to his rejection of myths and the sense of the sacred   In the 1950s  Roland Barthes published a series of essays examining modern myths and the process of their creation in his book Mythologies   6  Comparative mythology  Comparative mythology is the systematic comparison of myths from different cultures  It seeks to discover underlying themes that are common to the myths of multiple cultures  In some cases  comparative mythologists use the similarities between different mythologies to argue that those mythologies have a common source  This common source may be a common source of inspiration  e g  a certain natural phenomenon that inspired similar myths in different cultures  or a common  protomythology  that diverged into the various mythologies we see today   Nineteenth century interpretations of myth were often highly comparative  seeking a common origin for all myths  However  modern day scholars tend to be more suspicious of comparative approaches  avoiding overly general or universal statements about mythology  One exception to this modern trend is Joseph Campbell s book The Hero With a Thousand Faces  1949   which claims that all hero myths follow the same underlying pattern  This theory of a  monomyth  is out of favor with the mainstream study of mythology   7  Modern mythology  In modern society  myth is often regarded as historical or obsolete  Many scholars in the field of cultural studies are now beginning to research the idea that myth has worked itself into modern discourses  Modern formats of communication allow for widespread communication across the globe  thus enabling mythological discourse and exchange among greater audiences than ever before  Various elements of myth can now be found in television  cinema and video games   Although myth was traditionally transmitted through the oral tradition on a small scale  the technology of the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film dissemination  Singer  “Mythmaking  Philosophy in Film”  3–6   In the psychology of Carl Jung  myths are the expression of a culture or society’s goals  fears  ambitions and dreams  Indick  “Classical Heroes in Modern Movies  Mythological Patterns of the Superhero   93–95   Film is ultimately an expression of the society in which it was credited  and reflects the norms and ideals of the time and location in which it is created  In this sense  film is simply the evolution of myth  The technological aspect of film changes the way the myth is distributed  but the core idea of the myth is the same   The basis of modern storytelling in both cinema and television lies deeply rooted in the mythological tradition  Many contemporary and technologically advanced movies often rely on ancient myths to construct narratives  The Disney Corporation is notorious among cultural study scholars for “reinventing” traditional childhood myths  Koven  “Folklore Studies and Popular Film and Television  A Necessary Critical Survey”  176–195   While many films are not as obvious as Disney fairy tales in respect to the employment of myth  the plots of many films are largely based on the rough structure of the myth  Mythological archetypes such as the cautionary tale regarding the abuse of technology  battles between gods  and creation stories are often the subject of major film productions  These films are often created under the guise of cyberpunk action movies  fantasy dramas  and apocalyptic tales  Although the range of narratives  as well as the medium in which it is being told is constantly increasing  it is clear that myth continues to be a pervasive and essential component of the collective imagination  Cormer   Narrative   Critical Ideas in Television Studies  47–59    Recent films such as Clash of the Titans  Immortals  or Thor continue the trend of mining traditional mythology in order to directly create a plot for modern consumption   With the invention of modern myths such as urban legends  the mythological traditional will carry on to the increasing variety of mediums available in the 21st century and beyond  The crucial idea is that myth is not simply a collection of stories permanently fixed to a particular time and place in history  but an ongoing social practice within every society   8
