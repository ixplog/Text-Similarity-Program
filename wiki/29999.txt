psychic abilities that allow Danny to see the horrific past of the hotel  Soon  after a winter storm leaves them snowbound  the supernatural forces inhabiting the hotel influence Jack s sanity  leaving his wife and son in incredible danger   The Shining was adapted into a feature film in 1980 by director Stanley Kubrick  with a screenplay co written with Diane Johnson  which is regarded by some as one of the greatest films of all time  King himself was disappointed with the film  stating it had abandoned several of his book s major themes  The Shining was later adapted into a television mini series in 1997  closely monitored by King to ensure it followed the book  King wrote the series himself and was reportedly unable to criticize the Kubrick version due to his contract   1  Plot summary  The Shining mainly takes place in the fictional Overlook Hotel  an isolated  haunted resort located in the Colorado Rockies  The history of the hotel  which is described in backstory by several characters  includes the deaths of some of its guests and of former winter caretaker Delbert Grady  who succumbed to cabin fever and killed his family and himself   The plot centers on Jack Torrance  his wife Wendy  and their five year old son Danny  who move into the hotel after Jack accepts the position as winter caretaker  Jack is characterized as an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic with anger issues troubled by past binges that  prior to the story  had caused him to accidentally break Danny s arm and lose his position as a teacher  Jack hopes that the seclusion at the hotel will help him reconnect with his family and give him the motivation needed to work on a play  Danny  unbeknownst to his parents  possesses telepathic abilities referred to as the  shining  that enable him to read minds and experience premonitions  Dick Hallorann  the chef of the Overlook  senses Danny s abilities and helps to explain them to him  giving Hallorann and Danny a special connection   As the Torrances settle in at the Overlook  Danny sees frightening ghosts and visions  Although Danny is close to his parents  he does not tell either of them about his visions because he senses that the care taking job is important to his father and the family s future  Wendy considers leaving Jack at the Overlook to finish the job on his own  Danny refuses  thinking his father will be happier if they stay  However  Danny soon realizes that his presence in the hotel makes the supernatural activity more powerful  turning echoes of past tragedies into dangerous threats  Apparitions take form  and the garden s topiary animals come to life   The Overlook has difficulty possessing Danny  so it begins to possess Jack  frustrating his need and desire to work  Jack starts to develop cabin fever  and the sinister ghosts of the hotel gradually begin to overtake him  making him increasingly unstable  One day  after a fight with Wendy  Jack finds the hotel s bar fully stocked with alcohol despite being previously empty  and witnesses a party at which he meets the ghost of a bartender named Lloyd  As he gets drunk  the hotel urges Jack to kill his wife and son  He initially resists  but the increasing influence of the hotel proves too great  He becomes a monster under the control of the hotel  truly unable to control his dark side  Wendy and Danny get the better of Jack  locking him into the walk in pantry  but the ghost of Delbert Grady releases him after he makes Jack promise to bring him Danny and to kill Wendy  Jack attacks Wendy with one of the hotel s roque mallets  but she escapes to the caretaker s suite and locks herself in the bathroom  Jack tries to break the door with the mallet  but she slashes his hand with a razor blade to slow him down   Meanwhile  Dick Hallorann receives a psychic distress call from Danny while working at a winter resort in Florida  Hallorann rushes back to the Overlook  only to be attacked by the topiary animals and badly injured by Jack  As Jack pursues Danny through the Overlook  he briefly gains control of himself just long enough to tell Danny to run away  and that he loves him  The hotel takes control of Jack again  causing him to violently batter his own face and skull with the mallet so Danny can no longer recognize him  and Danny tells him that the unstable boiler in the basement is about to explode  Jack hurries down to relieve the pressure as Danny  Wendy  and Hallorann flee  Jack is too late  the boiler explodes and destroys the Overlook  Fighting off a last attempt by the hotel to possess him  Hallorann guides Danny and Wendy to safety   The book s epilogue is set during the next summer  Hallorann  who has taken a chef s job at a resort in Maine  comforts Danny over the loss of his father   2  Background  After writing Carrie and Salem s Lot  both of which are set in small towns in King s home state of Maine  King was looking for a change of pace for the next book   I wanted to spend a year away from Maine so that my next novel would have a different sort of background   King opened an atlas of the US on the kitchen table and randomly pointed to a location  which turned out to be Boulder  Colorado   On October 30  1974  Stephen and his wife Tabitha King checked into the Stanley Hotel in nearby Estes Park  Colorado  Stephen and Tabitha were the only two guests in the hotel that night   When we arrived  they were just getting ready to close for the season  and we found ourselves the only guests in the place â€” with all those long  empty corridors        They checked into room 217 which they found out was said to be haunted  This is where room 217 comes from in the book   Ten years prior  King had read Ray Bradbury s The Veldt and was inspired to someday write a story about a person whose dreams would become real  In 1972 King started a novel entitled Darkshine  which was to be about a psychic boy in a psychic amusement park  but the idea never came to fruition and King abandoned the book  During the night at the Stanley  this story came back to him   Tabitha and Stephen had dinner that evening in the grand dining room  totally alone  They were offered one choice for dinner  the only meal still available  Taped orchestral music played in the room and theirs was the only table set for dining   Except for our table all the chairs were up on the tables  So the music is echoing down the hall  and  I mean  it was like God had put me there to hear that and see those things  And by the time I went to bed that night  I had the whole book in my mind    After dinner  Tabitha decided to turn in  but Stephen took a walk around the empty hotel  He ended up in the bar and was served drinks by a bartender named Grady    That night I dreamed of my three year old son running through the corridors  looking back over his shoulder  eyes wide  screaming  He was being chased by a fire hose  I woke up with a tremendous jerk  sweating all over  within an inch of falling out of bed  I got up  lit a cigarette  sat in a chair looking out the window at the Rockies  and by the time the cigarette was done  I had the bones of the book firmly set in my mind    The Shining was also heavily influenced by Shirley Jackson s The Haunting of Hill House  Edgar Allan Poe s The Masque of the Red Death and The Fall of the House of Usher  and Robert Marasco s Burnt Offerings  The story has been often compared to Guy de Maupassant s story  The Inn    Prior to writing The Shining  King had written Roadwork and The Body which were both published later  The first draft of The Shining took less than four months to complete and he was able to publish it before the others  The title was inspired by the John Lennon song  Instant Karma    which contained the line  We all shine on       Bill Thompson  King s editor at Doubleday  tried to talk King out of The Shining as he felt after Carrie and  Salem s Lot  King would get  typed  as a horror writer  King considered that a compliment   3  Reception  The Shining currently holds a rating of 4 09 out of 5 stars on Goodreads  and a 4 7 out of 5 stars on Amazon com   4  Before the Play  Originally there was a prologue titled  Before the Play  that chronicled earlier events in the Overlook s nightmarish history   5  Sequel  On November 19  2009  during a reading at the Canon Theatre in Toronto  King described to the audience an idea for a sequel to The Shining  The idea was prompted by the occasional person asking   What ever happened to Danny   The story would follow Danny Torrance  now in his 40s  living in New Hampshire  where he works as an orderly at a hospice and helps terminally ill patients pass away with the aid of some extraordinary powers  Later  on December 1  2009  King posted a poll on his official website  asking visitors to vote for which book he should write next  Doctor Sleep or the next Dark Tower novel   Voting ended on December 31  2009  and it was revealed that Doctor Sleep received 5 861 votes  while The Wind Through the Keyhole received 5 812   In 2011  King posted an update confirming that Doctor Sleep was in the works and that the plot includes a traveling group of psychic vampires called The True Knot   Doctor Sleep was published on September 24  2013   6  Footnotes  7  External links    How to identify first edition copies of The Shining by
