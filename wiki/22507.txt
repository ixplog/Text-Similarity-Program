the Iran–Contra affair  a political scandal during the Reagan administration  in which he claimed partial responsibility for the sale of weapons through intermediaries to Iran  with the profits being channeled to the Contras in Nicaragua  It was alleged that he was responsible for the establishment of a covert network which subsequently funneled those funds to the Contras  Congress passed the Boland Amendment  to the House Appropriations Bill of 1982 and following years   which prohibited the appropriation of U S  funds by intelligence agencies for the support of the Contras  The money was passed through a shell organization  the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty  to the Palmer National Bank of Washington  D C   and then to the Contras   In an August 23  1986  e mail to National Security Adviser John Poindexter  North described a meeting with a representative of Panamanian president Manuel Noriega  “You will recall that over the years Manuel Noriega in Panama and I have developed a fairly good relationship ” North writes before explaining Noriega’s proposal  If U S  officials can “help clean up his image” and lift the ban on arms sales to the Panamanian Defense Force  Noriega will “‘take care of’ the Sandinista leadership for us ”  North told Poindexter that President Noriega could assist with sabotage against the ruling party of Nicaragua  the Sandinista National Liberation Front  North supposedly suggested that Noriega be paid one million dollars in cash  from Project Democracy funds raised from the sale of U S  arms to Iran—for the Panamanian leader’s help in destroying Nicaraguan economic installations   In November 1986  as the sale of weapons was made public  North was dismissed by President Ronald Reagan  On February 11  1987  the FBI detected an attack on North’s family from the Peoples Committee for Libyan Students  a sleeper cell for the Islamic Jihad  with an order to kill North  His family was moved to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and lived with federal agents until North retired from the Marine Corps the following year   In July 1987  North was summoned to testify before televised hearings of a joint congressional committee that was formed to investigate Iran–Contra  During the hearings  North admitted that he had lied to Congress previously  for which and other actions he was later charged  He defended his actions by stating that he believed in the goal of aiding the Contras  whom he saw as freedom fighters  against the Sandinistas and said that he viewed the Iran–Contra scheme as a “neat idea ” North admitted shredding government documents related to his Contra and Iranian activities  at William Casey’s suggestion  when the Iran–Contra scandal became public  He also testified that Robert McFarlane had asked him to alter official records to delete references to direct assistance to the Contras and that he had helped   North was tried in 1988  He was indicted on 16 felony counts  and on May 4  1989  he was initially convicted of three  accepting an illegal gratuity  aiding and abetting in the obstruction of a congressional inquiry  and ordering the destruction of documents through his secretary  Fawn Hall  He was sentenced by U S  District Judge Gerhard A  Gesell on July 5  1989  to a three year suspended prison term  two years probation  $150 000 in fines  and 1 200 hours of community service  North performed some of his community service within Potomac Gardens  a public housing project in Southeast Washington  D C   However  on July 20  1990  with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU   North’s convictions were vacated  after the appeals court found that witnesses in his trial might have been impermissibly affected by his immunized congressional testimony   Because North had been granted limited immunity for his congressional testimony  the law prohibited a prosecutor from using that testimony as part of a criminal case against him  To prepare for the expected defense challenge that North’s testimony had been used  the prosecution team had—before North’s congressional testimony had been given—listed and isolated all of its evidence  Further  the individual members of the prosecution team had isolated themselves from news reports and discussion of North’s testimony  While the defense could show no specific instance in which North’s congressional testimony was used in his trial  the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge had made an insufficient examination of the issue  Consequently  North’s convictions were reversed  After further hearings on the immunity issue  Judge Gesell dismissed all charges against North on September 16  1991   4 1  Allegations of involvement with drug traffickers  Allegations were made  most notably by the Kerry subcommittee  that North and other senior officials created a privatized Contra network that attracted drug traffickers looking for cover for their operations  then turned a blind eye to repeated reports of drug smuggling related to the Contras  and actively worked with known drug smugglers such as Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to assist the Contras  Journalist Gary Webb asserted in his journalistic series and book Dark Alliance  that North developed the idea of using drug money to support the resistance movement  Most Contra associates found guilty of trafficking by the Kerry committee were involved in the supply chain  ostensibly for “humanitarian goods ” though the supply chain was later found to have serviced the transport of arms   which had been set up by North  Organizations and individuals involved in the supply chain under investigation for trafficking included the company SETCO  operated by large scale trafficker Juan Matta Ballesteros   the fruit company Frigorificos de Puntarenas  rancher John Hull  and several Cuban exiles  North and other U S  government officials were criticized by the Kerry Report for their practice of “ticket punching” for these parties  whereby people under active investigation for drug trafficking were given cover and pay by joining in the Contra supply chain  Notably  cocaine trafficker and Contra Oscar Danilo Blandon was granted political asylum in the U S  despite knowledge of his running a drug ring  In addition to the Kerry committee’s investigation  the Costa Rican government of Óscar Arias conducted an investigation of Contra related drug trafficking  and as a result of this investigation  North and several other U S  government officials were permanently banned from entering Costa Rica   5  Later life and career  5 1  Politics  In the 1994 election  North unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate as the Republican Party candidate in Virginia

Charles Robb  a son in law of President Lyndon B  Johnson  Coleman received 11%  North s candidacy was documented in the 1996 film A Perfect Candidate   In his failed bid to unseat Robb  North raised
