Pi Day is an annual celebration commemorating the mathematical constant  pi   Pi Day is observed on March 14  or 3 14 in the month day date format   since 3  1  and 4 are the first three significant digits of in decimal form  In 2009  the United States House of Representatives supported the designation of Pi Day   Pi Approximation Day is observed on July 22  or 22 7 in the day month date format   since the fraction 22‚ÅÑ7 is a common approximation of   which dates from Archimedes   A sequential time will occur on 3 14 15 at 9 26 53 following the sequence of pi   1  History  The earliest known official or large scale celebration of Pi Day was organized by Larry Shaw in 1988 at the San Francisco Exploratorium  where Shaw worked as a physicist  with staff and public marching around one of its circular spaces  then consuming fruit pies  The Exploratorium continues to hold Pi Day celebrations   On March 12  2009  the U S  House of Representatives passed a non binding resolution  HRES 224   recognizing March 14  2009 as National Pi Day   For Pi Day 2010  Google presented a Google Doodle celebrating the holiday  with the word Google laid over images of circles and pi symbols   The entire month of March 2014  3 14  has been observed by some to be  Pi Month    In the year 2015  Pi Day will have special significance on 3 14 15 at 9 26 53 a m  and p m   with the date and time representing the first 10 digits of   That same second will also contain a precise instant corresponding to all of the digits of   However  some argue that 9 26 54 a m  and p m  on 3 14 15 are more accurate because of the 11th digit of being 5  which would cause the 10th digit to round up to 4   2  Observance  Pi Day has been observed in many ways  including eating pie  throwing pies and discussing the significance of the number   Some schools hold competitions as to which student can recall Pi to the highest number of decimal places   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  has often mailed its application decision letters to prospective students for delivery on Pi Day  Starting in 2012  MIT has announced it will post those decisions  privately  online on Pi Day at exactly 6 28 pm  which they have called  Tau Time   to honor the rival numbers Pi and Tau equally   The town of Princeton  New Jersey  hosts numerous events in a combined celebration of Pi Day and Albert Einstein s birthday  which is also March 14  Einstein lived in Princeton for more than twenty years while working at the Institute for Advanced Study  In addition to pie eating and recitation contests  there is an annual Einstein look alike contest   3  See also  Mole Day  Square Root Day  Sequential time  4  References  5  External links
