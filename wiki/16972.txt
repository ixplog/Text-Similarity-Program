The Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem  KAM theorem  is a result in dynamical systems about the persistence of quasi periodic motions under small perturbations  The theorem partly resolves the small divisor problem that arises in the perturbation theory of classical mechanics   The problem is whether or not a small perturbation of a conservative dynamical system results in a lasting quasiperiodic orbit  The original breakthrough to this problem was given by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1954  This was rigorously proved and extended by Vladimir Arnold  in 1963 for analytic Hamiltonian systems  and Jürgen Moser  in 1962 for smooth twist maps   and the general result is known as the KAM theorem  The KAM theorem  as it was originally stated  could not be applied directly as a whole to the motions of the solar system  However  it is useful in generating corrections of astronomical models  and to prove long term stability and the avoidance of orbital resonance in solar system  Arnold used the methods of KAM to prove the stability of elliptical orbits in the planar three body problem   1  Statement  The KAM theorem is usually stated in terms of trajectories in phase space of an integrable Hamiltonian system  The motion of an integrable system is confined to a doughnut shaped surface  an invariant torus  Different initial conditions of the integrable Hamiltonian system will trace different invariant tori in phase space  Plotting the coordinates of an integrable system would show that they are quasi periodic   The KAM theorem states that if the system is subjected to a weak nonlinear perturbation  some of the invariant tori are deformed and survive  while others are destroyed  The ones that survive are those that meet the non resonance condition  i e   they have “sufficiently irrational” frequencies  This implies that the motion continues to be quasiperiodic  with the independent periods changed  as a consequence of the non degeneracy condition   The KAM theorem specifies quantitatively what level of perturbation can be applied for this to be true  An important consequence of the KAM theorem is that for a large set of initial conditions the motion remains perpetually quasiperiodic   The methods introduced by Kolmogorov  Arnold  and Moser have developed into a large body of results related to quasi periodic motions  now known as KAM theory  Notably  it has been extended to non Hamiltonian systems  starting with Moser   to non perturbative situations  as in the work of Michael Herman  and to systems with fast and slow frequencies  as in the work of Mikhail B  Sevryuk    The non resonance and non degeneracy conditions of the KAM theorem become increasingly difficult to satisfy for systems with more degrees of freedom  As the number of dimensions of the system increases  the volume occupied by the tori decreases   Those KAM tori that are not destroyed by perturbation become invariant Cantor sets  named Cantori by Ian C  Percival in 1979   As the perturbation increases and the smooth curves disintegrate we move from KAM theory to Aubry Mather theory which requires less stringent hypotheses and works with the Cantor like sets   2  See also  Arnold diffusion  Nekhoroshev estimates  Ergodic theory  3  References  Arnold  Weinstein  Vogtmann  Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics  2nd ed   Appendix 8  Theory of perturbations of conditionally periodic motion  and Kolmogorov s theorem  Springer 1997   Rafael de la Llave  2001     from Scholarpedia  H Scott Dumas    2014  World Scientific Publishing  ISBN 978 981 4556 58 3
