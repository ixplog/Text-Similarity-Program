Plutarch      Ploútarkhos    later named  upon becoming a Roman citizen  Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus     c  AD 46 – AD 120   was a Greek historian  biographer  and essayist  known primarily for his Parallel Lives and Moralia  He is considered today to be a Middle Platonist   1  Early life  Plutarch was born to a prominent family in the small town of Chaeronea about twenty miles east of Delphi in the Greek region known as Boeotia  His family was wealthy  The name of Plutarch s father has not been preserved  but it was probably Nikarchus     from the common habit of Greek families to repeat a name in alternate generations  The name of Plutarch s grandfather was Lamprias  as he attested in Moralia and in his Life of Antony   His brothers  Timon and Lamprias  are frequently mentioned in his essays and dialogues  where Timon is spoken of in the most affectionate terms  Rualdus  in his 1624 work Life of Plutarchus  recovered the name of Plutarch s wife  Timoxena  from internal evidence afforded by his writings  A letter is still extant  addressed by Plutarch to his wife  bidding her not give way to excessive grief at the death of their two year old daughter  who was named Timoxena after her mother  Interestingly  he hinted at a belief in reincarnation in that letter of consolation   The exact number of his sons is not certain  although two of them  Autobulus and second Plutarch  are often mentioned  Plutarch s treatise De animae procreatione in Timaeo is dedicated to them  and the marriage of his son Autobulus is the occasion of one of the dinner parties recorded in the  Table Talk   Another person  Soklarus  is spoken of in terms which seem to imply that he was Plutarch s son  but this is nowhere definitely stated  His treatise on marriage questions  addressed to Eurydice and Pollianus  seems to speak of her as having been recently an inmate of his house  but without enabling us to form an opinion whether she was his daughter or not   Plutarch studied mathematics and philosophy at the Academy of Athens under Ammonius from 66 to 67  He had a number of influential friends  including Quintus Sosius Senecio and Fundanus  both important senators  to whom some of his later writings were dedicated  Plutarch travelled widely in the Mediterranean world  including central Greece  Sparta  Corinth  Patrae  Patras   Sardis  Alexandria  and two trips to Rome   At some point  Plutarch took up Roman citizenship  As evidenced by his new name  Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus  his sponsor for citizenship was Lucius Mestrius Florus  a Roman of consular status whom Plutarch also used as a historical source for his Life of Otho   He lived most of his life at Chaeronea  and was initiated into the mysteries of the Greek god Apollo  However  his duties as the senior of the two priests of Apollo at the Oracle of Delphi  where he was responsible for interpreting the auguries of the Pythia  apparently occupied little of his time  He led an active social and civic life while producing an extensive body of writing  much of which is still extant   For many years Plutarch served as one of the two priests at the temple of Apollo at Delphi  the site of the famous Delphic Oracle  twenty miles from his home  By his writings and lectures Plutarch became a celebrity in the Roman empire  yet he continued to reside where he was born  and actively participated in local affairs  even serving as mayor  At his country estate  guests from all over the empire congregated for serious conversation  presided over by Plutarch in his marble chair  Many of these dialogues were recorded and published  and the 78 essays and other works which have survived are now known collectively as the Moralia   2  Work as magistrate and ambassador  In addition to his duties as a priest of the Delphic temple  Plutarch was also a magistrate in Chaeronea and he represented his home on various missions to foreign countries during his early adult years  Plutarch held the office of archon in his native municipality  probably only an annual one which he likely served more than once  He busied himself with all the little matters of the town and undertook the humblest of duties   The Suda  a medieval Greek encyclopedia  states that emperor Trajan made Plutarch procurator of Illyria  However  most historians consider this unlikely  since Illyria was not a procuratorial province  and Plutarch probably did not speak Illyrian   According to the 8th 9th century historian George Syncellus  late in Plutarch s life  emperor Hadrian appointed him nominal procurator of Achaea – a position that entitled him to wear the vestments and ornaments of a consul himself   Plutarch died between the years AD 119 and 127   3  Lives of the Roman emperors  The first biographical works to be written by Plutarch were the Lives of the Roman Emperors from Augustus to Vitellius  Of these  only the Lives of Galba and Otho survive  The Lives of Tiberius and Nero are extant only as fragments  provided by Dasmascius  Life of Tiberius  cf  his Life of Isidore  and Plutarch himself  Life of Nero  cf  Galba 2 1   respectively  These early emperors’ biographies were probably published under the Flavian dynasty or during the reign of Nerva  CE 96–98    There is reason to believe that the two Lives still extant  those of Galba and Otho  “ought to be considered as a single work ” Therefore they do not form a part of the Plutarchian canon of single biographies – as represented by the Life of Aratus of Sicyon and the Life of Artaxerxes II  the biographies of Hesiod  Pindar  Crates and Daiphantus were lost   Unlike in these biographies  in Galba Otho the individual characters of the persons portrayed are not depicted for their own sake but instead serve as an illustration of an abstract principle  namely the adherence or non adherence to Plutarch’s morally founded ideal of governing as a Princeps  cf  Galba 1 3  Moralia 328D–E    Arguing from the perspective of Platonian political philosophy  cf  Republic 375E  410D E  411E 412A  442B C   in Galba Otho Plutarch reveals the constitutional principles of the Principate in the time of the civil war after Nero’s death  While morally questioning the behavior of the autocrats  he also gives an impression of their tragic destinies  ruthlessly competing for the throne and finally destroying each other  “The Caesars’ house in Rome  the Palatium  received in a shorter space of time no less than four Emperors ” Plutarch writes  “passing  as it were  across the stage  and one making room for another to enter”  Galba 1    Galba Otho was handed down through different channels  It can be found in the appendix to Plutarch’s Parallel Lives as well as in various Moralia manuscripts  most prominently in Maximus Planudes’s edition where Galba and Otho appear as “Opera” XXV and XXVI  Thus it seems reasonable to maintain that Galba Otho was from early on considered as an illustration of a moral ethical approach  possibly even by Plutarch himself   4  Parallel Lives  Plutarch s best known work is the Parallel Lives  a series of biographies of famous Greeks and Romans  arranged in pairs to illuminate their common moral virtues and vices  The surviving Lives contain 23 pairs  each with one Greek Life and one Roman Life  as well as four unpaired single Lives   As is explained in the opening paragraph of his Life of Alexander  Plutarch was not concerned with history so much as the influence of character  good or bad  on the lives and destinies of men  Whereas sometimes he barely touched on epoch making events  he devoted much space to charming anecdote and incidental triviality  reasoning that this often said far more for his subjects than even their most famous accomplishments  He sought to provide rounded portraits  likening his craft to that of a painter  indeed  he went to tremendous lengths  often leading to tenuous comparisons  to draw parallels between physical appearance and moral character  In many ways  he must be counted amongst the earliest moral philosophers   Some of the Lives  such as those of Heracles  Philip II of Macedon and Scipio Africanus  no longer exist  many of the remaining Lives are truncated  contain obvious lacunae or have been tampered with by later writers  Extant Lives include those on Solon  Themistocles  Aristides  Agesilaus II  Pericles  Alcibiades  Nicias  Demosthenes  Pelopidas  Philopoemen  Timoleon  Dion of Syracuse  Eumenes  Alexander the Great  Pyrrhus of Epirus  Romulus  Numa Pompilius  Coriolanus  Theseus  Aemilius Paullus  Tiberius Gracchus  Gaius Gracchus  Gaius Marius  Sulla  Sertorius  Lucullus  Pompey  Julius Caesar  Cicero  Cato the Younger  Mark Antony  and Marcus Junius Brutus   4 1  Spartan lives and sayings  Since Spartans wrote no history prior to the Hellenistic period  and since their only extant literature is fragments of seventh century lyrics  Plutarch s five Spartan lives and Sayings of Spartans and Sayings of Spartan Women  rooted in sources that have since disappeared  are one of the richest sources for historians of Lacedaemonia  But they are also controversial  Plutarch lived centuries after the Sparta he writes about  and a full millennium separates him from the earliest events he records  and even though he visited Sparta  many of the ancient customs he reports had been long abandoned  meaning he never actually saw with his eyes what he detailed with his pen  Plutarch s sources themselves can be problematic  As the historians Sarah Pomeroy  Stanley Burstein  Walter Donlan  and Jenniefer Tolbert Roberts have written   Plutarch was influenced by histories written after the decline of Sparta and marked by nostalgia for a happier past  real or imagined   Turning to Plutarch himself  they write   the admiration writers like Plutarch and Xenophon felt for Spartan society led them to exaggerate its monolithic nature  minimizing departures from ideals of equality and obscuring patterns of historical change   But while they fault Plutarch for inflating Spartans  egalitarianism and heroic immunity to pain  they find value in his  large quantities of information  and claim that  for better or worse   Plutarch s writings on Sparta  more than those of any other ancient author  have shaped later views of Sparta    4 2  Life of Alexander  Plutarch s Life of Alexander  written as a parallel to that of Julius Caesar  is one of only five extant tertiary sources on the Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great  It includes anecdotes and descriptions of events that appear in no other source  just as Plutarch s portrait of Numa Pompilius  the putative second king of Rome  holds much that is unique on the early Roman calendar   Plutarch devotes a great deal of space to Alexander s drive and desire  and strives to determine how much of it was presaged in his youth  He also draws extensively on the work of Lysippus  Alexander s favourite sculptor  to provide what is probably the fullest and most accurate description of the conqueror s physical appearance   When it comes to his character  however  Plutarch is often rather less accurate  ascribing inordinate amounts of self control to a man who very often lost it  It is significant  though  that the subject incurs less admiration from his biographer as the narrative progresses and the deeds that it recounts become less savoury   Much  too  is made of Alexander s scorn for luxury   He desired not pleasure or wealth  but only excellence and glory   This is mostly true  for Alexander s tastes grew more extravagant as he grew older only in the last year of his life and only as a means of approaching the image of a ruler his Persian subjects were better accustomed to — thus making it easier for him to succeed in uniting the Greek and Persian worlds together  according to the plan he had announced in his famous Speech given in Opis in 324 BC   4 3  Life of Caesar  Together with Suetonius s The Twelve Caesars this Life is the main account of Julius Caesar s feats by ancient historians  Plutarch starts by telling us the audacity of Caesar and his refusal of dismissing Cinna s daughter  Cornelia  Other important parts are these containing his military deeds  accounts of battles and Caesar s capacity of inspiring the soldiers   However  this Life shows few differences between Suetonius  work and Caesar s own works  see De Bello Gallico and De Bello Civili   Sometimes  Plutarch quotes directly from the De Bello Gallico and even tells us of the moments when Caesar was dictating his works   In the final part of this Life  Plutarch counts Caesar s assassination  and several details  The book ends on telling the destiny of his murderers  and says that Caesar s  great guardian genius  avenged him after life   4 4  Life of Pyrrhus  Plutarch s Life of Pyrrhus is a key text because it is the main historical account on Roman history for the period from 293 to 264 BC  for which neither Dionysius nor Livy have surviving texts   4 5  Criticism of Parallel Lives  Plutarch stretches and occasionally fabricates the similarities between famous Greeks and Romans in order to be able to write their biographies as parallel  The lives of Nicias and Crassus  for example  have nothing in common except that both were rich and both suffered great military defeats at the ends of their lives   In his Life of Pompey  Plutarch praises Pompey s trustworthy character and tactful behaviour in order to conjure a moral judgement that opposes most historical accounts  Plutarch delivers anecdotes with moral points  rather than in depth comparative analyses of the causes of the fall of the Achaemenid Empire and the Roman Republic  and tends on occasion to fit facts to hypotheses   On the other hand  he generally sets out his moral anecdotes in chronological order  unlike  say  his Roman contemporary Suetonius  and is rarely narrow minded and unrealistic  almost always prepared to acknowledge the complexity of the human condition where moralising cannot explain it   5  Moralia  The remainder of Plutarch s surviving work is collected under the title of the Moralia  loosely translated as Customs and Mores   It is an eclectic collection of seventy eight essays and transcribed speeches  which includes On Fraternal Affection—a discourse on honour and affection of siblings toward each other  On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great—an important adjunct to his Life of the great king  On the Worship of Isis and Osiris  a crucial source of information on Egyptian religious rites   along with more philosophical treatises  such as On the Decline of the Oracles  On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance  On Peace of Mind and lighter fare  such as Odysseus and Gryllus  a humorous dialogue between Homer s Odysseus and one of Circe s enchanted pigs  The Moralia was composed first  while writing the Lives occupied much of the last two decades of Plutarch s own life   5 1  On the Malice of Herodotus  In On the Malice of Herodotus Plutarch criticizes the historian Herodotus for all manner of prejudice and misrepresentation  It has been called the “first instance in literature of the slashing review ” The 19th century English historian George Grote considered this essay a serious attack upon the works of Herodotus  and speaks of the  honourable frankness which Plutarch calls his malignity   Plutarch makes some palpable hits  catching Herodotus out in various errors  but it is also probable that it was merely a rhetorical exercise  in which Plutarch plays devil s advocate to see what could be said against so favourite and well known a writer  According to Plutarch scholar R  H  Barrow  Herodotus’ real failing in Plutarch’s eyes was to advance any criticism at all of those states that saved Greece from Persia  “Plutarch ” he concluded  “is fanatically biased in favor of the Greek cities  they can do no wrong ”  5 2  Questions  Book IV of the Moralia contains the Roman and Greek Questions  Αἰτίαι Ῥωμαϊκαί and Αἰτίαι Ἑλλήνων   The customs of Romans and Greeks are illuminated in little essays that pose questions such as  Why were patricians not permitted to live on the Capitoline   and then suggests answers to them  often several mutually exclusive   5 3  Pseudo Plutarch  Pseudo Plutarch is the conventional name given to the unknown authors of a number of pseudepigrapha attributed to Plutarch  Some editions of the Moralia include several works now known to be pseudepigrapha  among these are the Lives of the Ten Orators  biographies of the Ten Orators of ancient Athens  based on Caecilius of Calacte   The Doctrines of the Philosophers  and On Music  One  pseudo Plutarch  is held responsible for all of these works  though their authorship is of course unknown  The thoughts and opinions recorded are not Plutarch s and come from a slightly later era  though they are all classical in origin   6  Other works  Symposiacs  Συμποσιακά   7  Lost works  The Romans loved the Lives  and enough copies were written out over the centuries so that a copy of most of the lives managed to survive to the present day  Some scholars  however  believe that only a third to one half of Plutarch’s corpus is extant  The lost works of Plutarch are determined by references in his own texts to them and from other authors  references over time  There are traces of twelve more Lives that are now lost   Plutarch s general procedure for the Lives was to write the life of a prominent Greek  then cast about for a suitable Roman parallel  and end with a brief comparison of the Greek and Roman lives  Currently  only nineteen of the parallel lives end with a comparison while possibly they all did at one time  Also missing are many of his Lives which appear in a list of his writings  those of Hercules  the first pair of Parallel Lives  Scipio Africanus and Epaminondas  and the companions to the four solo biographies  Even the lives of such important figures as Augustus  Claudius and Nero have not been found and may be lost forever   8  Philosophy  Plutarch was a Platonist  but was open to the influence of the Peripatetics  and in some details even to Stoicism despite his polemics against their principles  He rejected absolutely only Epicureanism  He attached little importance to theoretical questions and doubted the possibility of ever solving them  He was more interested in moral and religious questions   In opposition to Stoic materialism and Epicurean  atheism  he cherished a pure idea of God that was more in accordance with Plato  He adopted a second principle  Dyad  in order to explain the phenomenal world  This principle he sought  however  not in any indeterminate matter but in the evil world soul which has from the beginning been bound up with matter  but in the creation was filled with reason and arranged by it  Thus it was transformed into the divine soul of the world  but continued to operate as the source of all evil  He elevated God above the finite world  and thus daemons became for him agents of God s influence on the world  He strongly defends freedom of the will  and the immortality of the soul   Platonic Peripatetic ethics were upheld by Plutarch against the opposing theories of the Stoics and Epicureans  The most characteristic feature of Plutarch s ethics is  however  its close connection with religion  However pure Plutarch s idea of God is  and however vivid his description of the vice and corruption which superstition causes  his warm religious feelings and his distrust of human powers of knowledge led him to believe that God comes to our aid by direct revelations  which we perceive the more clearly the more completely that we refrain in  enthusiasm  from all action  this made it possible for him to justify popular belief in divination in the way which had long been usual among the Stoics   His attitude to popular religion was similar  The gods of different peoples are merely different names for one and the same divine Being and the powers that serve it  The myths contain philosophical truths which can be interpreted allegorically  Thus Plutarch sought to combine the philosophical and religious conception of things and to remain as close as possible to tradition   9  Influence  Plutarch s writings had an enormous influence on English and French literature  Shakespeare paraphrased parts of Thomas North s translation of selected Lives in his plays  and occasionally quoted from them verbatim   Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalists were greatly influenced by the Moralia — so much so  in fact  that Emerson called the Lives  a bible for heroes  in his glowing introduction to the five volume 19th century edition  He also opined that it was impossible to  read Plutarch without a tingling of the blood  and I accept the saying of the Chinese Mencius   A sage is the instructor of a hundred ages  When the manners of Loo are heard of  the stupid become intelligent  and the wavering  determined     Montaigne s Essays draw extensively on Plutarch s Moralia and are consciously modelled on the Greek s easygoing and discursive inquiries into science  manners  customs and beliefs  Essays contains more than 400 references to Plutarch and his works   James Boswell quoted Plutarch on writing lives  rather than biographies  in the introduction to his own Life of Samuel Johnson  Other admirers included Ben Jonson  John Dryden  Alexander Hamilton  John Milton  Louis L amour  and Francis Bacon  as well as such disparate figures as Cotton Mather and Robert Browning   Plutarch s influence declined in the 19th and 20th centuries  but it remains embedded in the popular ideas of Greek and Roman history  One of his most famous quotes was one that he included in one of his earliest works   The world of man is best captured through the lives of the men who created history    Plutarch Heavensbee is a character from the The Hunger Games trilogy by American author Suzanne Collins  presumably based on Plutarch  adding to a line of many ancient Greek and Roman or Greek  or Roman sounding names in Collins  work  the inspirations often taken from literature  myths  religions or philosophy   which may or may not also include Cinna  Caesar  Coriolanus and the name of the country in the series  Panem  which is taken from the old phrase  panem et circenses  AKA  bread and circuses    10  Translations of Lives and

text of Plutarch  from which he published a French translation of the Lives in 1559 and Moralia in 1572  which were widely read by educated Europe  Amyot s translations had as deep an impression in England as France  because Thomas North later published his English translation of the Lives in 1579 based on Amyot’s French translation instead of the original Greek   10 3  English translations  Plutarch s Lives were translated into English  from Amyot s version  by Sir Thomas North in 1579  The complete Moralia was first translated into English from the original Greek by Philemon Holland in 1603   In 1683  John Dryden began a life of Plutarch and oversaw a translation of the Lives by several hands and based on the original Greek  This translation has been reworked and revised several times  most recently in the 19th century by the English poet and classicist Arthur Hugh Clough which can be found in Random House  Inc  translation   In 1770  English brothers John and William Langhorne published  Plutarch s Lives from the original Greek  with notes critical and historical  and a new life of Plutarch  in 6 volumes and dedicated to Lord Folkestone  Their translation was re edited by Archdeacon Wrangham in the year 1819   From 1901–1912  American classicist produced a new translation of the Lives for the Loeb Classical Library series  The Moralia are also included in the Loeb series  though are translated by various authors   10 4  Latin translations  There are multiple translations of Parallel Lives into Latin  most notably the one titled  Pour le Dauphin   French

three volumes by the Bialik Institute in 1954  1971 and 1973  The first volume  Roman Lives  first published in 1954  presents the translations of Joseph G  Liebes to the biographies of Coriolanus  Fabius Maximus  Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus  Cato the Elder and Cato the Younger  Gaius Marius  Sulla  Sertorius  Lucullus  Pompey  Crassus  Cicero  Julius Caesar  Brutus and Mark Anthony   The second volume  Greek Lives  first published in 1971 presents A  A  Halevy s translations of the biographies of Lycurgus  Aristides  Cimon  Pericles  Nicias  Lysander  Agesilaus  Pelopidas  Dion  Timoleon  Demosthenes  Alexander the Great  Eumenes and Phocion  Three more biographies presented in this volume  those of Solon  Themistocles and Alcibiades were translated by M  H  Ben Shamai   The third volume  Greek and Roman Lives  published in 1973  presented the remaining biographies and parallels as translated by Halevy  Included are the biographies of Demetrius  Pyrrhus  Agis and Cleomenes  Aratus and Artaxerxes  Philopoemen  Camillus  Marcellus  Flamininus  Aemilius Paulus  Galba and Otho  Theseus  Romulus  Numa Pompilius and Poplicola  It completes the translation of the known remaining biographies  In the introduction to the third volume Halevy explains that originally the Bialik Institute intended to publish only a selection of biographies  leaving out mythological figures and biographies that had no parallels  Thus  to match the first volume in scope the second volume followed the same path and the third volume was required   11  See also  Middle Platonism
