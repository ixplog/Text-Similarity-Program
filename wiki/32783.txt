It has been argued that the New Testament contributed toward subsequent antisemitism in the Christian community  A  Roy Eckardt has asserted that the foundation of antisemitism and responsibility for the Holocaust lies ultimately in the New Testament   1  The New Testament and Christian antisemitism  A  Roy Eckardt  a pioneer in the field of Jewish Christian relations  asserted that the foundation of antisemitism and responsibility for the Holocaust lies ultimately in the New Testament  Eckardt insisted that Christian repentance must include a reexamination of basic theological attitudes toward Jews and the New Testament in order to deal effectively with antisemitism   According to Rabbi Michael J  Cook  Professor of Intertestamental and Early Christian Literature at the Hebrew Union College  there are ten themes in the New Testament that are the greatest sources of anxiety for Jews concerning Christian antisemitism   The Jews are culpable for crucifying Jesus   as such they are guilty of deicide  The tribulations of the Jewish people throughout history constitute God s punishment of them for killing Jesus  Jesus originally came to preach only to the Jews  but when they rejected him  he abandoned them for gentiles instead  The Children of Israel were God s original chosen people by virtue of an ancient covenant  but by rejecting Jesus they forfeited their chosenness   and now  by virtue of a New Covenant  or  testament    Christians have replaced the Jews as God s chosen people  the Church having become the  People of God    The Jewish Bible  the so called  Old Testament   repeatedly portrays the opaqueness and stubbornness of the Jewish people and their disloyalty to God   The Jewish Bible contains many predictions of the coming of Jesus as the Messiah  or  Christ    yet the Jews are blind to the meaning of their own Bible   By the time of Jesus  ministry  Judaism had ceased to be a living faith   Judaism s essence is a restrictive and burdensome legalism   Christianity emphasizes excessive love  while Judaism maintains a balance of justice  God of wrath and love of peace   Judaism s oppressiveness reflects the disposition of Jesus  opponents called  Pharisees   predecessors of the  rabbis    who in their teachings and behavior were hypocrites  see Woes of the Pharisees   Cook believes that both contemporary Jews and contemporary Christians need to reexamine the history of early Christianity  and the transformation of Christianity from a Jewish sect consisting of followers of a Jewish Jesus  to a separate religion often dependent on the tolerance of Rome while proselytizing among Gentiles loyal to the Roman empire  to understand how the story of Jesus came to be recast in an anti Jewish form as the Gospels took their final form   Some scholars assert that critical verses in the New Testament have been used to incite prejudice and violence against Jewish people  Professor Lillian C  Freudmann  author of Antisemitism in the New Testament  University Press of America  1994  has published a study of such verses and the effects that they have had in the Christian community throughout history  Similar studies have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars  including  Professors Clark Williamsom  Christian Theological Seminary   Hyam Maccoby  The Leo Baeck Institute   Norman A  Beck  Texas Lutheran College   and Michael Berenbaum  Georgetown University    2  Jewish Christian conflict in the New Testament  There are some verses in the New Testament that describe Jews in a positive way  attributing to them salvation or divine love  In the story of the crucifixion  meanwhile  Jews prompt Jesus  execution and say  His blood be on us  and on our children   referred to as the blood curse  In the Book of John  Jesus calls certain Pharisees  children of the devil    According to the New Testament Gospels  Jesus  on his fateful entry into Jerusalem before Passover  was received by a great crowd of people  Jesus was arrested and tried by the Sanhedrin  After the trial  Jesus was handed over to Pontius Pilate  who duly tried him again and  at the urging of the people  had him crucified   The New Testament records that Jesus  disciple Judas Iscariot  the Roman governor Pontius Pilate along with Roman forces and the leaders and people of Jerusalem were  to varying degrees  responsible for the death of Jesus   2 1  Gospel of Mark  According to the Gospel of Mark  Jesus  crucifixion was authorized by Roman authorities at the insistence of leading Jews  Judeans  from the Sanhedrin   Paul H  Jones writes   2 2  Gospel of Matthew  As Matthew s narrative marches toward the passion  the anti Jewish rhetoric increases  In chapter 21  the parable of the vineyard is followed by the great  stone  text  an early Christological interpretation of    The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone   Then  in chapters 23 and 24  three successive hostile pericopes are recorded  First  a series of  woes  are pronounced against the Pharisees   Then  Jesus laments over the capital   Jerusalem  Jerusalem  the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it   See  your house is left to you  desolate      And finally  Jesus predicts the demise of the Temple   Truly I tell you  not one stone will be left here upon another  all will be thrown down       The culmination of this rhetoric  and arguably the one verse that has caused more Jewish suffering than any other second Testament passage  is the uniquely Matthean attribution to the Jewish people   His  Jesus s  blood be on us and on our children       This so called  blood guilt  text has been interpreted to mean that all Jews  of Jesus  time and forever afterward  accept responsibility for the death of Jesus   Shelly Matthews writes   Douglas Hare noted that the Gospel of Matthew avoids sociological explanations for persecution   The term  Jews  in the Gospel of Matthew is applied to those who deny the resurrection of Jesus and believe that the disciples stole Jesus s corpse   2 3  Gospel of John  The Gospel of John collectively describes the enemies of Jesus as  the Jews   In none of the other gospels do  the Jews  demand  en masse  the death of Jesus  instead  the plot to put him to death is always presented as coming from a small group of priests and rulers  the Sadducees  John s gospel is thus the primary source of the image of  the Jews  acting collectively as the enemy of Jesus  which later became fixed in the Christian mind   For example  in Jesus moves around in Galilee but avoids Judea  because  the Jews  were looking for a chance to kill him  In some said  he is a good man  whereas others said he deceives the people  but these were all  whispers   no one would speak publicly for  fear of the Jews   Jewish rejection is also recorded in       and   says many did believe  but they kept it private  for fear the Pharisees would exclude them from the Synagogue  After the crucifixion  has the disciples hiding behind locked doors   for fear of the Jews    In several places John s gospel also associates  the Jews  with darkness and with the devil  In John 8 37 39  44 47  Jesus says  speaking to a group of Pharisees   John s use of the term  Jews  is a complex and debated area of biblical scholarship  Some scholars argue that the author most likely considered himself Jewish and was probably speaking to a largely Jewish community  New Testament scholar J G  Dunn writes   Because of this controversy some modern English translations  such as Today s New International Version  remove the term  Jews  and replace it with more specific terms to avoid anti Semitic connotations  For example  the Jesus Seminar translates this as  Judeans   i e  residents of Judea  in contrast to residents of Galilee  Most critics of these translations  while conceding this point  argue that the context  since it is obvious that Jesus  John himself  and the other disciples were all Jews  makes John s true meaning sufficiently clear  and that a literal translation is preferred   Paul Jones writes   2 4  Book of Revelation  In Revelation 2 9 and 3 9 Jews appear to be called a synagogue of Satan  The idea of a Jewish Antichrist developed from these verses   2 4 1  Later commentary  Successive generations of Christians read in the Gospel of John the collective guilt of Jews  universally and in all generations  in the death of Christ  John s use of the collective expression  the Jews  is likely explained by the historical circumstances in which and audience for which he wrote  After the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD  the Jewish priesthood  and thus the class of the Sadducees  no longer existed  As John wrote his Gospel after these events  for a gentile audience  he spoke generically of Jews  rather than specifying a group within Judaism that no longer existed and that would have been unfamiliar to his readers   3  Christian responses  The Catholic Church has denounced antisemitic views held by Christians in the past with a series of statements beginning in 1937  cf  Mit Brennender Sorge of Pope Pius XI   In the decree Nostra Aetate  Pope Paul VI in Council declared that    The Church believes that by His cross Christ  Our Peace  reconciled Jews and Gentiles  making both one in Himself     God holds the Jews most dear for the sake of their Fathers  He does not repent of the gifts He makes or of the calls He issues     the death of Christ     cannot be charged against all the Jews  without distinction  then alive  nor against the Jews of today     the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God  as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures     the Church     decries hatred  persecutions  displays of anti Semitism  directed against Jews at any time and by anyone   Norman Beck  professor of theology and classical languages at Texas Lutheran University  has proposed that Christian lectionaries remove what he calls  … the specific texts identified as most problematic …   Beck identifies what he deems to be offensive passages in the New Testament and indicates the instances in which these texts or portions thereof are included in major lectionary series   Daniel Goldhagen  former Associate Professor of Political Science at Harvard University  also suggested in his book A Moral Reckoning that the Roman Catholic Church should change its doctrine and the accepted Biblical canon to excise statements he labels as antisemitic  to indicate that  The Jews  way to God is as legitimate as the Christian way    4  See also  Christianity and Judaism  Origins of Christianity  5  Further reading  Eckhardt  A  Roy  Elder and Younger Brothers  The Encounter of Jews and
