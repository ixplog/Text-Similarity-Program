Tacitus      c  200 â€“ June 276   was Roman Emperor from 275 to 276  During his short reign he campaigned against the Goths and the Heruli  for which he received the title Gothicus Maximus   1  Early life  Tacitus was born in Interamna  Terni   in Italia  He circulated copies of the historian Gaius Cornelius Tacitus  work  which was barely read at the time  and so we perhaps have him to thank for the partial survival of Tacitus  work  however  modern historiography rejects his claimed descent from the historian as forgery  In the course of his long life he discharged the duties of various civil offices  including that of consul in 273  with universal respect   2  Emperor  After the assassination of Aurelian  Tacitus was chosen by the Senate to succeed him  and the choice was cordially ratified by the army  This was the last time the Senate elected a Roman Emperor  There was an interregnum between Aurelian and Tacitus  and there is substantial evidence that Aurelian s wife  Ulpia Severina  ruled in her own right before the election of Tacitus  At any rate  Tacitus was situated at Campania when he heard the news of his election  and he quickly rushed to Rome  He decided to re involve the Senate in some consultative manner in the mechanisms of government and asked the Senate to deify Aurelian  before arresting and executing Aurelian s murderers   2 1  Fighting barbarians  Next he moved against the barbarian mercenaries that had been gathered by Aurelian to supplement Roman forces for his Eastern campaign  These mercenaries had plundered several towns in the Eastern Roman provinces after Aurelian had been murdered and the campaign cancelled  His half brother  the Praetorian Prefect Florianus  and Tacitus himself won a victory against these tribes  among which were the Heruli  gaining the emperor the title Gothicus Maximus   2 2  Death  On his way back to the west to deal with a Frankish and Alamannic invasion of Gaul  according to Aurelius Victor  Eutropius and the Historia Augusta  Tacitus died of fever at Tyana in Cappadocia in June 276  It was reported that he began acting strangely  declaring that he would alter the names of the months to honor himself  before succumbing to a fever  In a contrary account  Zosimus claims he was assassinated  after appointing one of his relatives to an important command in Syria   3  In popular culture  He appears in Harry Sidebottom s historical fiction novel series Warrior Of Rome   4  Sources  4 1  Primary sources  Historia Augusta  Vita Taciti   Eutropius  Breviarium ab urbe condita  ix  16   Aurelius Victor   Epitome de Caesaribus    Zosimus   Historia Nova    Joannes Zonaras  Compendium of History  4 2  Secondary sources  Jones  A H M   Martindale  J R  The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire  Vol  I  AD260 395  Cambridge University Press  1971  Southern  Pat  The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine  Routledge  2001  Gibbon  Edward Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire  1888   5  References  6  Further reading  Constantine P  Cavafy  The Complete Poems  Harcourt  Brace & World  1961   p  201  Alan Dugan  Poems 2  Yale University Press  1963   p  33  7  External links
