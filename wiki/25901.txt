signing with the Dodgers on February 19  1954  The climate and language differences affected him early on  but he received the assistance of his teammate Joe Black  who was able to speak Spanish  Clyde Sukeforth  a scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates  noticed that Clemente was being used as a bench player for the Royals and discussed the possibility of drafting Clemente to the Pittsburgh Pirates with the team s manager  Max Macon  Clemente hit  257 in 87 games that summer  The Pirates selected Clemente as the first selection of the rookie draft that took place on November 22  1954   2 3  Major League Baseball  2 3 1  Pittsburgh Pirates  1955–1972   2 3 2  The 1950s  Clemente debuted with the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 17  1955  in the first game of a double header against the Brooklyn Dodgers  At the beginning of his time with the Pirates  he experienced frustration because of racial tension with the local media and some teammates  Clemente responded to this by stating   I don t believe in color   He noted that  during his upbringing  he was taught to never discriminate against someone based on ethnicity   Clemente was at a double disadvantage  as he was a Latino who knew very little English  and of mixed African descent  The year before  the Pirates had become the fifth team in the National League and ninth in the majors to break the baseball color line when they hired Curt Roberts who debuted with the team  This was seven years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball s color line with the Dodgers  Upon arriving in Pittsburgh  Roberts befriended Clemente and helped him adjust to life in the majors  as well as to get used to life in Pittsburgh   During the middle of the season  Clemente was involved in a car accident due to a drunk driver  this caused him to miss several games with an injury in his lower back  He finished his rookie season with an average of  255  despite confronting trouble hitting certain types of pitches  His defensive skills were highlighted during this season   2 3 2 1  Marine Corps Reserve  During the off season  Clemente played with the Santurce Crabbers in the Puerto Rican baseball winter league  where he was already considered a star  He was traded to the Criollos de Caguas team  Caribbean baseball  and played for them during the 1957–1958 season  The Pirates experienced several difficult seasons through the

reserve player   He participated in both of the two All Star games that were played that season   During 1961 spring training  following advice from Pirates  batting coach George Sisler  Clemente tried to modify his batting technique by using a heavier bat to slow the speed of his swing  During the 1961 season  Clemente was selected as the National League starting right fielder in the All Star game  He hit a triple on his first at bat and scored the team s first run  With the American League ahead 4–3 in the tenth inning  Clemente hit a double to give the National League a decisive 5–4 win

San Juan  as well as playing with the team during the Major League offseason  During the course of the winter league  Clemente was injured and only participated as a pinch hitter in the league s All Star game  He experienced a complication on his injury during the course of this game and underwent surgery shortly after being carried off the playing field   This condition limited his role with the Pirates in the first half of the 1965 season  during which he batted an average of  257  He was inactive for several games during this stage of the campaign before being fully active  when he returned to the starting lineup  he hit in thirty three out of thirty four games and his average improved to  340  Roberto and Vera had their first son on August 17  1965  when Roberto Clemente  Jr  was born

1970 season was the last one that the Pittsburgh Pirates played in Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium  for Clemente  abandoning this stadium was an emotional situation  The Pirates  final game at Forbes Field occurred on June 28  1970  That day  Clemente noted that it was hard to play in a different field  saying   I spent half my life there   The night of July 24  1970  was declared  Roberto Clemente Night   on this day  several Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three Rivers Stadium and cheered Clemente while wearing traditional Puerto Rican indumentary  A ceremony to honor Clemente took place  during which he received a scroll with 300 000 signatures compiled in Puerto Rico  and several thousands of dollars were donated to charity work following Clemente s request   During the 1970 campaign  Clemente compiled an average of  352  the Pirates won the National League East pennant but were subsequently eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds  In the offseason  Clemente

season  the Pirates won the NL East  defeated the San Francisco Giants in four games to win the National League pennant  and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series  Baltimore had won 100 games and swept the American League Championship Series  both for the third consecutive year  and were the defending World Series champions  The Orioles won the first two games in the series  but

massive earthquake on Saturday December 23  1972  Clemente  who had been visiting Managua three weeks before the quake  immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights  He soon learned  however  that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government  never reaching victims of the quake   Clemente decided to accompany the fourth relief flight  hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors  The airplane he chartered for a New Year s Eve flight  a Douglas DC 7  had a history of mechanical problems and sub par flight personnel  and it was overloaded by 4 200 pounds  It crashed into the ocean off the coast of Isla Verde  Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on Sunday December

tomorrow   Clemente s older step brother  Luis  died on December 31  1954 and his step sister a few years later   At the time of his death  Clemente had established several records with the Pirates

film in New York  other cities  and DVD   10  Canonization  The feature film  Baseball s Last Hero  21 Clemente Stories  was a labor of love for Richard Rossi and the cadre of actors and technicians who volunteered their time and donated their services to the project  Rossi s telling of Clemente s story of commitment  loyalty  and devotion attempts to provide a counterpoint to today s baseball culture of players suspected of steroid abuse  The dramatic fulcrum of Baseball’s Last Hero is a conversation Clemente has with a nun   She talks to him about the cross  ’Greater love has no man than to lay down his life for his friends ’ is what the nun quotes to him from Scripture  talking about ’sacrificial love and Christ’s sacrificial love ’  Rossi said   This is the theme I wanted to point out    an allegory of Christ on the cross   Rossi was pressured to delete the scene from the movie for being  too preachy and too Catholic   The controversial scene turned out to be one of the most popular scenes in the film and won over fans to the idea of pitching the Pope for Clemente s canonization as a saint  Rossi  a former evangelical minister  received several messages of support  including a letter showing papal support from Pope Francis in starting the process from the Vatican through the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington  D C  and from Archbishop Jose Horacio Gomez of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles   11  See also  3 000 hit club  Baseball s Last Hero  21 Clemente Stories  Hispanics in the United States Marine Corps  List of baseball players who died during their
