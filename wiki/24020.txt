Pope Benedict XIV    31 March 1675 – 3 May 1758   born Prospero Lorenzo Lambertini  was Pope from 17 August 1740 to his death in 1758   In life  Benedict XIV was loved by the people of the Papal States who praised him  He was incredibly intelligent and witty  had a sense of humour and was dubbed the  Pope of Concordats  during his papacy  He was known to be a proud patron of the arts and of science  He was well known for visiting major edifices and monuments in Rome by carriage and sedan chair to make public appearances   Perhaps one of the greatest scholars in Christendom  he promoted scientific learning  the baroque arts  and the study of the human form  In terms of the governance of the Papal States  he reduced taxation and also encouraged agriculture  He also supported free trade  A scholar  he laid the groundwork for the present Vatican Museum  Benedict XIV  to an extent can be considered a polymath due to his numerous studies of ancient literature  the publishing of ecclesiastical books and documents  the study of the human body  and his great devotion to art   1  Early life  1 1  Birth and studies  Lambertini was born into a noble family of Bologna to Marcello Lambertini and Lucrezia Bulgarini  the third of five children  At the time of his birth  Bologna was the second largest city in the Papal States  At the age of thirteen  he began attending the Collegium Clementianum in Rome  where he studied rhetoric  Latin  philosophy  and theology  During his studies as a young man  he often studied the works of St  Thomas Aquinas  who was his favorite author and saint  While he enjoyed studying at Collegium Clementianum  the bent of his mind was well towards ecclesiastical and civil law  and actively enforcing it  Soon after  in 1694 at the young age of nineteen  he received the degree of Doctor of Sacred Theology and Doctor Utriusque Juris   both ecclesiastical and civil law    1 2  Ecclesiastical Career  On the death of Innocent XII  he was made a consistorial advocate by Clement XI  a Pope with whom he worked closely  Shortly after  he was created a Consultor of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition  then in 1708  Promoter of the Faith  in 1712 a theologian of canon law and assessor of the Sacred Congregation of Rites  in 1713 he was named monsignor  in 1718 secretary of the Sacred Congregation of the Council  and in 1725  titular bishop of Theodosia   He was made Bishop of Ancona in 1727  He was created a cardinal in pectore  his name being published on 30 April 1728  and was subsequently made the Cardinal Priest of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme on 10 May 1728  He also served as the Archbishop of Bologna   2  Ascension to the papacy  After the death of Pope Clement XII  Lambertini attended the papal conclave to choose a successor  It would last for six months  After long deliberation  Lambertini was put forth to the cardinal electors as a compromise candidate  and it is reported that he said to the members of the College of Cardinals  If you wish to elect a saint  choose Gotti  a statesman  Aldrovandi  an honest man  me    Vincenzo Ludovico Gotti  1664舑1742  was professor of philosophy at the College of Saint Thomas  the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas  Angelicum  and perhaps the leading Thomist of his time  Aldrovandi was a canon lawyer and Cardinal of the Catholic Church    This appears to have assisted his cause for winning the election  which also benefited from his reputation for deep learning  gentleness  pomp  wisdom  and piety in policy  On August 17  1740  he was elected in the evening and took his new pontifical name of Benedict XIV in honour of Pope Benedict XIII  He was crowned on August 21  1740  and by August 30  1740  the famous ephemeral baroque structures of the Festival of the Chinea and the triumphal arch of Benedict XIV were erected by Charles III of Spain  who was then a Pontifical vassal and monarch of the Kingdom of Naples   3  Pontificate  Lambertini s papacy as Pope Benedict XIV began in a time of great difficulties  chiefly caused by the disputes between Catholic rulers and the papacy about governmental demands to nominate bishops rather than leaving the appointment to the Church  He managed to overcome most of these problems — the Holy See s disputes with the Kingdom of Naples  Sardinia  Spain  Venice  and Austria were settled   3 1  Reforms  He had a very active papacy  reforming the education of priests  the calendar of feasts of the Church  and many papal institutions  Perhaps the most important act of Benedict XIV s pontificate was the promulgation of his famous laws about missions in the two bulls  Ex quo singulari and Omnium solicitudinum  In these bulls he ruled on the custom of accommodating non  Christian words and usages to express Christian ideas and practices of the native cultures  which had been extensively done by the Jesuits in their Indian and Chinese missions  An example of this is the statues of ancestors – there had long been uncertainty whether honour paid to one s ancestors was unacceptable  ancestor worship   or if it was something more like the Catholic veneration of the saints  This question was especially pressing in the case of an ancestor known not to have been a Christian  The choice of a Chinese translation for the name of God had also been debated since the early 17th century  Benedict XIV denounced these practices in these two bulls  The consequence of this was that many of these converts left the Church   The Apostolic Constitution Sacramentorum Poenitentiae of 1741 assigned to the Holy Office the responsibility of safeguarding the sanctity of the sacrament of penance   3 2  Other activities  On 22 December 1741  Benedict XIV promulgated the papal bull  Immensa Pastorum Principis  against the enslavement of the indigenous peoples of the Americas and other countries   On 18 May 1743  Benedict XIV signed a document addressed to the Archbishops and Bishops of the Kingdom of Poland regarding marriage  communicating his dissatisfaction with the dissolution of Christian marriages  even long stable ones  by the Ecclesiastical Courts of Poland without due cause or in violation of canon law   Benedict XIV was also responsible  along with Cardinal Passionei  for beginning the catalogue of the Vatican Library  Benedetto  Duke of Chablais  a military commander of the French Revolution and member of the House of Savoy  rulers of the kingdom of Sardinia  was named after him  Infanta Benedita of Portugal was also named after him   In 1750  Benedict XIV declared a Holy Year   In one of his encyclicals  Pastoralis Romani Pontificis  which was promulgated on March 30  1740  he is one of many popes to enforce and declare that he  his predecessors  and all his successors hold Papal Infallibility and that ecumenical councils should be discouraged  as they can undermine the one of the principle pillars of the papacy   infallibility   During his papacy  Benedict XIV commissioned a team of architects lead by Nicola Salvi and Luigi Vanvitelli to design a large palace that was to be  more complex and with greater baroque style than the box of a palace Vanvitelli designed in Caserta   The palace was to be built south of St  Peter s Basilica  but was never built  as the plans were quietly ignored by Benedict s successor  Clement XIII  They were brought up once more by Pius VI late in his papacy  but had to stop due to the possibility of invasion   Benedict XIV consecrated the expensive gilded baroque chapel  Chapel of St  John the Baptist   on 15 December 1744 in Sant Antonio dei Portoghesi  The chapel was designed by Nicola Salvi and Luigi Vanvitelli  and was then shipped to Portugal to be placed in the Igreja de Sāo Roque   4  Death and burial  Benedict XIV s health worsened in 1758 and after a battle with gout  he died on 3 May 1758 at the age of 83  His final words to those surrounding him on his deathbed were   I leave you in the hands of God   Following this  he was interred in Saint Peter s Basilica and a large catafalque was erected in his honor   5  See
