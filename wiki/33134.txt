World music is a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the world  including traditional music  neotraditional music  and music where more than one cultural tradition intermingle  World music s inclusive nature and elasticity as a musical category pose obstacles to a universal definition  but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in fRoots magazine s description of the genre as  local music from out there   The term was popularized in the late 20th century as a marketing category for non Western traditional music  Globalization has facilitated the expansion of world music s audiences and scope  It has grown to include hybrid subgenres such as world fusion  global fusion  ethnic fusion and worldbeat   1  Terminology  The term has been credited to ethnomusicologist Robert E  Brown  who coined it in the early 1960s at Wesleyan University in Connecticut  where he developed undergraduate through the doctoral programs in the discipline  To enhance the process of learning  he invited more than a dozen visiting performers from Africa and Asia and began a world music concert series  The term became current in the 1980s as a marketing classificatory device in the media and the music industry  There are several conflicting definitions for world music  One is that it consists of  all the music in the world   though such a broad definition renders the word virtually meaningless  The term also is taken as a classification of music that combines Western popular music styles with one of many genres of non Western music that are also described as folk music or ethnic music  However  world music is not exclusively traditional folk music  It may include cutting edge pop music styles as well  Succinctly  it can be described as  local music from out there   or  someone else s local music   It is a very nebulous term with an increasing number of genres that fall under the umbrella of world music to capture musical trends of combined ethnic style and texture  including Western elements  examples noted in this section    World music may incorporate distinctive non Western scales  modes and or musical inflections  and often features distinctive traditional ethnic instruments  such as the kora  West African harp   the steel drum  the sitar or the didgeridoo   Music from around the world exerts wide cross cultural influence as styles naturally influence one another  and in recent years world music has also been marketed as a successful genre in itself  Academic study of world music  as well as the musical genres and individual artists with which it has been associated  can be found in such disciplines as anthropology  folkloristics  performance studies and ethnomusicology   1 1  Evolving terminology  In the age of digital music production the increased availability of high quality  ethnic music samples  sound bites and loops from every known region are commonly used in commercial music production  which has exposed a vast spectrum of indigenous music texture to developing  independent artists  These influences proliferate quickly in a web based music industry that is now percolating as a much larger  predominantly self promoted menu  via an increasing number of indie artist friendly  streaming Internet options  such as Last fm  Rhapsody  Live365  Jango Artist Airplay and ReverbNation  An amalgamation of roots music in the global  contemporary listening palette has become apparent  which weakens the role major entertainment labels can play in the cultural perception of genre boundaries  As a result  definitions of the genre have become particularly varied  and determined by particularly wide ranging and varied opinions   Similar terminology between distinctly different sub categories under primary music genres  such as world  rock and pop can be as ambiguous and confusing to industry moguls as it is to consumers  This is especially true in the context of world music  where branches of ethnically influenced pop trends are as genre defined by consumer perception as they are by the music industry forums that govern the basis for categorical distinction  Academic scholars tend to agree that  in today s world of consumer music reviews and blogging  global music culture s public perception is what ultimately distils a prevailing basis for definition from genre ambiguity  regardless of how clearly a category has been outlined by corporate marketing forums and music journalism  The world music genre s gradual migration from a clear spectrum of roots music traditions to an extended list of hybrid subgenres is a good example of the motion genre boundaries can exhibit in a globalizing pop culture  The classic  original definition of world music was in part created to instill a perceived authenticity and distinction between indigenous music traditions and those that eventually become diluted by pop culture  and the modern debate over how possible it is to maintain that perception in the richly diverse genre of world music is ongoing   In a report on the 2014 globalFEST National Public Radio s Anastasia Tsioulcas said  Even within the  world music  community  nobody likes the term  world music   It smacks of all kinds of loaded issues  from cultural colonialism to questions about what s  authentic  and what isn t  and who might get to police such inquiries   and forces an incredible array of styles that don t have anything in common under the label of  exotic Other   What s more  I believe that in many people s imaginations   world music  means a kind of fairly awful  gloppy  hippy ish  worldbeat fusion  It s a problematic  horrible term that satisfies absolutely no one    2  Examples  Examples of popular forms of world music include the various forms of non European classical music  e g  Japanese koto music  Indian raga music  Tibetan chants   Eastern European folk music  e g  the village music of the Balkans   Nordic folk music and the many forms of folk and tribal music of the Middle East  Africa  Asia  Oceania and Central and South America  The Breton musician Alan Stivell pioneered the connection between traditional folk music  modern rock music and world music with his 1970 s album Renaissance of the Celtic Harp   The broad category of world music includes isolated forms of ethnic music from diverse geographical regions  These dissimilar strains of ethnic music are commonly categorized together by virtue of their indigenous roots  Over the 20th century  the invention of sound recording  low cost international air travel and common access to global communication among artists and the general public has given rise to a related phenomenon called  crossover  music  Musicians from diverse cultures and locations could readily access recorded music from around the world  see and hear visiting musicians from other cultures and visit other countries to play their own music  creating a melting pot of stylistic influences   While communication technology allows greater access to obscure forms of music  the pressures of commercialization also present the risk of increasing musical homogeneity  the blurring of regional identities  and the gradual extinction of traditional local music making practices   3  Hybrid examples  Since the music industry established this term  the fuller scope of what an average music consumer defines as  world  music in today s market has grown to include various blends of ethnic music tradition  style and interpretation  and derivative world music genres have been coined to represent these hybrids  such as World fusion  Global fusion  Ethnic fusion or Worldbeat  Good examples of hybrid  world fusion are the Irish   West African meld of Afro Celt Sound System  the pan cultural sound of Aomusic and the jazz   Finnish folk music of Värttinä  each of which bear tinges of contemporary  Western influence—an increasingly noticeable element in the expansion genres of world music  World fusion   Worldbeat   Ethnic fusion   Global fusion can also blend specific indigenous sounds with more blatant elements of Western pop  Good examples are Paul Simon s Graceland album  on which South African Mbaqanga music is heard  Peter Gabriel s work with Pakistani Sufi singer  Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan  the Deep Forest project  in which vocal loops from West Africa are blended with Western  contemporary rhythmic textures and harmony structure  and the work of Mango  who combined pop and rock music with world elements   More recent bands who exhibit experimentation with World music Hybrid Forms include Vampire Weekend  The Very Best  Island Cassettes & Yeasayer many of which cite inspiration from the work of Paul Simon   Depending on style and context  world music can sometimes share the new age music genre  which is a category that often includes Ambient music and textural expressions from indigenous roots sources  Good examples are Tibetan bowls  Tuvan throat singing  Gregorian chant or Native American flute music  World music blended with new age music is a sound  loosely classified as the hybrid genre  ethnic fusion  Examples of ethnic fusion are Nicholas Gunn s  Face to Face  from Beyond Grand Canyon  featuring authentic Native American flute combined with synthesizers  and  Four Worlds  from The Music of the Grand Canyon  featuring spoken word from Razor Saltboy of the Navajo Indian Nation   3 1  World fusion  The subgenre world fusion is often  mistakenly assumed to refer exclusively to a blending of Western jazz fusion elements with world music  Although such a hybrid expression falls easily into the world fusion category  the suffix  fusion  in the term world fusion should not be assumed to mean only jazz fusion  Western jazz combined with strong elements of world music is more accurately termed world fusion jazz  ethnic jazz or non Western jazz  World fusion and global fusion are nearly synonymous with the genre term worldbeat  and though these are considered subgenres of popular music  they may also imply universal expressions of the more general term  world music  Throughout the 1970s and 80s  fusion in the jazz music genre implied a blending of jazz and rock music  which is where the misleading assumption is rooted   4  Popular non Western genres  Although it primarily describes traditional music  the world music category also includes popular music from non Western urban communities  e g  South African  township  music  and non European music forms that have been influenced by other so called third world musics  e g  Afro Cuban music   although Western style popular song sourced from non English speaking countries in Western Europe  e g  French pop music  would not generally be considered world music   Paris is one of the great European capitals for world music  For many years  the city has attracted numerous musicians from former colonies in West and North Africa  This scene is aided by the fact that there are many concerts and institutions that help promote the music   Algerian and Moroccan music have an important presence in the French capital  Hundreds of thousands of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants have settled in Paris  bringing the sounds of Amazigh  Berber   raï  and Gnawa music  Algerian raï also found a large French audience   The West African community is also very large  integrated by people from Senegal  Mali  Côte d Ivoire  and Guinea  They have introduced manding jeli music  mbalax and other styles   5  After 1987  WOMAD and beyond  One origin of the term was the initiation of World Music Day  Fête de la Musique  in 1982 in France  World Music Day has been celebrated on 21 June every year since then  On 29 June 1987 a meeting of interested parties gathered to capitalize on the marketing of this genre  Arguably popular interest was sparked with the release in 1986 of Paul Simon s Graceland album  The concept behind the album was to express his own sensibilities using the sounds he had fallen in love with while listening to artists from Southern Africa  including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Savuka  This project and the work of Peter Gabriel and Johnny Clegg among others had  to some degree  introduced non Western music to a wider audience  They saw this as an opportunity which should not be ignored  Zila Khan is one of today s leading singers in World Music   Before 1987  world music had a following but it was still difficult for interested parties to sell their music to the larger music stores  Although specialist music stores had been important in developing the genre over many years  the record companies  broadcasters and journalists had been finding it difficult to build a following because the music  itself  seemed too scarce  However  they were aware that the jazz and classical markets had developed a crossover audience and decided that the best way forward would be to have a collective strategy in order to bring the music to a wider audience   At around this time  Cultural Co operation started the Music Village Festival  A regular series of free world music festivals which are running to this day  A network of world music artists was also created to help promote their work   5 1  1987 meeting  At the outset of the 1987 meeting  the musician Roger Armstrong advised the reason why something needed to be done   The first concern of the meetings was to select the umbrella name that this music would be listed under  Suggestions included  world beat  and prefixing words such as  hot  or  tropical  to existing genre titles   World music  won after a show of hands  but initially it was not meant to be the title for a whole new genre  rather something which all of the record labels could place on the sleeves of records in order to distinguish them during the forthcoming campaign  Afterward they agreed that despite the publicity campaign  this wasn t an exclusive club and that for the good of all  any label which was selling this type of music would be able to take advantage   Another issue which needed to be addressed was the distribution methods which existed at the time  Most of the main labels were unhappy with the lack of specialist knowledge displayed by sales persons which led to poor service  there was also a reluctance amongst many of the larger outlets to carry the music  because they understandably liked larger releases which could be promoted within store  It was difficult to justify a large presentation expense if the stock going into stores was limited   6  Marketing  One of the marketing strategies used in the vinyl market at the time was the use of browser cards  which would appear in the record racks  As part of the  world music  campaign  it was decided that these would be a two color affair designed to carry a special offer package  to aid the retailer a selection of labels would also be included  presumably for shelf or rack edging   In an unprecedented move  all of the world music labels coordinated together and developed a compilation cassette for the cover of the music magazine NME  The overall running time was 90 minutes  each package containing a mini catalog showing the other releases on offer   By the time of a second meeting it was becoming clear that in order for the campaign to be successful  it should have its own dedicated press officer  The press officer would be able to juggle the various deadlines and also be able to sell the music as a concept to not just the national stations  but also regional DJs who were keen to expand the variety of music they could offer  The DJs were a key resource as it was important for  world music  to be seen as something which could be important to people outside London—most regions after all had a similarly rich folk heritage which could be tapped into  A cost effective way of achieving all this would be a leafleting campaign   The next step was to develop a world music chart  gathering together selling information from around fifty shops  so that it would finally be possible to see which were big sellers in the genre — allowing new listeners to see what was particularly popular  It was agreed that the NME could again be involved in printing the chart and also Music Week and the London listings magazine City Limits  It was also suggested that Andy Kershaw might be persuaded to do a run down of this chart on his show regularly   7  Relationship to immigration and multiculturalism  In most wealthy industrialized countries  large amounts of immigration from other regions has been ongoing for many decades  This has introduced non Western music to Western audiences not only has  exotic  imports  but also as local music played by fellow citizens  Caribbean music in the United Kingdom or Chicano rock in the United States would be two obvious examples  But the process is ongoing and continues to produce new forms  In the 2010s several musicians from immigrant communities in the West rose to global popularity  such as Haitian American Wyclef Jean  Somali Canadian K naan  Tamil Briton M I A   or Lebanese Colombian Shakira  often blending the music of their heritage with hip hop or pop   The diverse nature of major Western cities has changed the pace of musical intermixing  Once  an established Western artist might collaborate with an established African artist to produce an album or two  Now  new bands and new genres are built from the ground up by young performers  For example the Punjabi Irish fusion band Delhi 2 Dublin is from neither India nor Ireland  but Vancouver  Canada   In Vancouver  musicians and composers also work collectively to create original compositions for various combinations of ethnic and western instruments  The JUNO nominated is a trio of two Chinese instruments and the marimba  plus other percussion instruments   It has been touring across North American since 1997  stages musicians and instruments from China  Taiwan  India  Iran  Africa  Vietnam      with Canadian western orchestral players   There is also Canada s most famous Traditional Indian Classical Musician  Cassius Khan who is an award winning internationally renowned as the world s only Ghazal singer who accompanies himself on the Tabla a two piece hand drum indigenous to India  Khan himself has not made his views unknown on his dislike to Robert E Brown s term  World Music  by publicly stating he found the term  Colonial and Oppressing  and he has been a hot issue in most underground meetings of the musical elites in Canada   8  World Music Month  October 1987 was designated  World Music Month   A music festival  Crossing the Border  was held at the Town & Country Club in London  and it was the start of the winter season for both WOMAD and Arts Worldwide  The main press release stressed the issues inherent in the campaign   Since the early 1980s the enthusiasm for music from  outside  Western pop culture has been steadily mounting  More and more international artists  many of whom are big stars in their own countries  are coming to England and North America on tour  They started off  like the Bhundu Boys  playing small clubs and pubs  but now many acts are so popular that they are filling larger venues   Examples of radio shows that feature world music include World of Music on Voice of America  Transpacific Sound Paradise on WFMU  The Planet on Australia s ABC Radio National  DJ Edu presenting D N A  DestiNation Africa on BBC Radio 1Xtra  Adil Ray on the BBC Asian Network  Andy Kershaw s show on BBC Radio 3 and Charlie Gillett s show on the BBC World Service   9  Today  World music radio programs today often play African hip hop or reggae artists  crossover Bhangra and Latin American jazz groups  etc  Common media for world music include public radio  webcasting  the BBC  NPR  and ABC  Australian Broadcasting Corporation   The scope of what is considered world music has increased  By default  non region specific or multi cultural world music projects are often listed under the generic category of world music   10  Criticisms  The generally accepted geographic standard for what designates world music is withstanding criticism for its universal asymmetry  where nearly every classifiable region under the term is defined  relative to Western music culture  this is primarily due to the fact that dominant corporate structures for music distribution and promotion originate in and   as do the forums for establishing industry genre categories  Therefore  in market context   ethnic  music is synthetically defined by a radius that extends from a Western center   Some musicians and curators of music have come to dislike the term  world music   To these critics   world music  is a parochial  catch all marketing term for non Western music of all genres  In   label founder and ex Talking Heads frontman David Byrne wrote an    editorial in explaining his objections to the term  Byrne argued that the labelling and categorization of other cultures as  exotic  serves to attract an insincere consumption and deter other potential consumers   11  Awards  The BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music was an award given to world music artists between 2002 and 2008  sponsored by BBC Radio 3  The award was thought up by fRoots magazine s editor Ian Anderson  inspired by the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards  Award categories included  Africa  Asia Pacific  Americas  Europe  Mid East and North Africa  Newcomer  Culture Crossing  Club Global  Album of the Year  and Audience Award  Initial lists of nominees in each category were selected annually by a panel of several thousand industry experts  Shortlisted nominees were voted on by a twelve member jury  which selected the winners in every category except for the Audience Award category  These jury members were appointed and presided over by the BBC  The annual awards ceremony was held at the BBC Proms and winners were given an award called a  Planet   In March 2009  the BBC made a decision to axe the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music   In response to the BBC s decision to end its awards program  the British world music magazine Songlines launched the Songlines Music Awards in 2009  to recognise outstanding talent in world music    The WOMEX Awards were introduced in 1999 to honor the high points of world music on an international level and to acknowledge musical excellence  social importance  commercial success  political impact and lifetime achievement  Every October at the WOMEX event  the award figurine—an ancient mother goddess statue dating back about 6000 years to the Neolithic age—is presented in an award ceremony to a worthy member of the world music community   12  Festivals  Many festivals are identified as being  world music   here is a small representative selection   The WOMAD Foundation organizes festivals in countries around the world
