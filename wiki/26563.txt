Marine archeology in the Gulf of Khambhat   earlier known as Gulf of Cambay   centers on findings made in December 2000 by the National Institute of Ocean Technology  NIOT   NIOT came across palaeo river channels in the sea  These were seen by the scientists involved to be the extension of the present day major rivers of the area  In a similar marine survey  in a Coastal Research Ship during 1999 2000 when Dr S Badrinaryan was the Chief Scientist  several unusual frames of Side Scan Sonar images were encountered  These had square and rectangular features in an arranged geometric fashion which are not expected by the scientist in the marine domain  As per the scientist involved such features are unlikely to be due to natural marine geological processes  This made the scientists suspect that human workmanship must have been involved here  The surveys were followed up in the following years and a couple of palaeo channels of old rivers were discovered in the middle of the Khambhat area under 20 40m water depths  at a distance of about 20 km from the present day coast   1  Initial Discovery  In 19 May 2001  India s Union Minister for Human Resource Development  Science and Technology division  Murli Manohar Joshi  announced that the ruins of an ancient civilization had been discovered off the coast of Gujarat  in the Gulf of Khambhat  The site was discovered by NIOT while they performed routine pollution studies using sonar  and was described as an area of regularly spaced geometric structures  It is located 20 km from the Gujarat coast  spans 9 km  and can be found at a depth of 30â€“40 meters  In his announcement  Joshi represented the site as an urban settlement that pre dates the Indus Valley Civilization  Further descriptions of the site by Joshi describe it as containing regularly spaced dwellings  a granary  a bath  a citadel  and a drainage system  However it was later in 22 of May  reported that the discovery has not been dated and the discovery resembles Harrapan civilization dating 4 000 years ago  Such as  great baths Furthermore the Indus civilization port Lothal is located at the head   Gulf of Khambhat   2  Follow up excavations  A follow up investigation was conducted by NIOT in November 2001  which included dredging to recover artifacts and sonar scans to detect structures  Among the artifacts recovered were a piece of wood  pottery sherds  weathered stones initially described as hand tools  fossilized bones  and a tooth  Artifacts were sent to the National Geophysical Research Institute  NGRI  in Hyderabad  India  the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleobotany  BSIP  in Lucknow  India  and the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad  India  The piece of wood was carbon dated to an age of 9 500 years old   NIOT returned for further investigation in the Gulf from October 2002 to January 2003  During these excavations  NIOT reported finding two paleochannels flanked by rectangular and square basement like features  Artifacts were recovered by means of dredging  including pottery sherds  microliths  wattle and daub remains  and hearth materials  These artifacts were sent for dating at the laboratories of Manipur University and Oxford University  The wattle and daub remains are composed of locally available clay  reed  husk  pottery pieces  and pieces of fresh water shell  The wattle and daub also shows evidence of partial burning   The most recent work in the Gulf of Khambhat took place from October 2003 to January 2004 and was primarily a geologic study  Techniques used during this investigation include bathymetry survey  sub bottom survey  side scan survey  and magnetic survey  One of the major findings from this investigation concerns the orientation of sand ripples at the site  NIOT researchers claim that there are two sets of ripples visible at the site  One set is a natural feature formed by tidal currents  whilst they say the other set has formed in relation to underlying structural features   3  Controversies  3 1  Carbon Dates  One of the main controversies surrounding the GKCC is the dated piece of wood  Dr  D P  Agrawal  chairman of the Paleoclimate Group and founder of Carbon 14 testing facilities in India stated in an article in Frontline Magazine that the piece was dated twice  at separate laboratories  The NGRI in Hyderabad returned a date of 7190 BC and the BSIP in Hannover returned a date of 7545 7490 BC  Some archeologists  Agrawal in particular  contest that the discovery of an ancient piece of wood does not imply the discovery of an ancient civilization  Agrawal argues that the wood piece is a common find  given that 20 000 years ago the Arabian Sea was 100 meters lower than its current level  and that the gradual sea level rise submerged entire forests   3 2  Artifacts  Another controversial issue are the artefacts retrieved from the site during the various excavations  It is disputed that many of the items that have been identified as artefacts by the NIOT investigators are actually man made  Instead their artificial nature is contested and they are argued to be stones of natural origin   Researchers report finding sherds of pottery as indicative of hand made and wheel turned pottery traditions  The reported sherds have simple rims with small incised lines  All of the pottery fragments found so far are small or miniature sherds  Part of the controversy is that some of the  sherds  are natural geofacts and others lack any proof of any connections  as with the dated pieces of wood  with the purported  ruins  found by NIOT researchers  In addition  their small size also raises the possibility that the real sherds have been transported from elsewhere by local  strong tidal currents  But if the pottery is genuine  researchers say it should show some similarities to Harappan pottery  which is typically red and black and stamped with seals  Based on the current pottery collection  a stylistic continuity of Harappan civilization isn t evident  The small size of the artefact collection makes it difficult to analyse the pottery conclusively   3 3  Geography  The Gulf of Khambhat was formed by a major rift that resulted in a down sliding of the Khambhat region  The area is very tectonically active today  and several faults can be found in the gulf  Periodic earthquakes also occur here  This knowledge has led several archeologists to state that the site is not in a secure enough context to be reliably dated  Because of the tectonic activity and strong currents  these archeologists claim that there is not sufficient stratification to be sure the recovered artifacts can be associated with the site   3 4  Collection Methods  Complaints have arisen because NIOT recovered artefacts by dredging the sea floor of the site  This method might allow errant artefacts to be collected along with those that actually correlate with the site  Analysing stratification is virtually impossible with this method as well   4  See also  Dwaraka Kingdom  Archaeological Survey of India  Mahabharata  Indology  Historiography and nationalism  Pseudoarchaeology  5  References  6  External links
