In physics  radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium  This includes electro magnetic radiation such as radio waves  visible light  and x rays  particle radiation such as α  β  and neutron radiation and acoustic radiation such as ultrasound  sound  and seismic waves  Radiation may also refer to the energy  waves  or particles being radiated   The word arises from the phenomenon of waves radiating  i e   travel outward in all directions  from a source  This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that are applicable to all types of radiation  Because such radiation expands as it passes through space  and as its energy is conserved  in vacuum   the power of all types of radiation radiating from a point source follows an inverse square law in relation to the distance from its source  While it is most common that radiation may be emitted radially from a point source  such as a light bulb filament or a microwave antenna  there are other modes of radiation  Some examples are radiation from a phosphorescent panel  chaotic   a laser beam  coherent   and emitted from a parabolic mirror  parallel   in which cases adherence to the inverse square law is violated   EMR is energy transferred by waves of combined electric charge and magnetic monopole  capable of traveling through a vacuum and traveling at the universal speed of light in whatever media it is passing through  the speed is dependent on the media  and is fastest in vacuum  In quantum mechanics these waves have been shown to have particle structure as well as wave structure  these particles are called photons  EMR includes radio and microwave signals  infrared  radiant heat   visible light and ultraviolet  and x rays and gamma rays  These are differentiated from one another by the frequency of the waves  which directly correlates with the energy carried in each type s photons  This is the first definition of radiation stated in the opening paragraph   Notice that the differentiation of radiation into the classes above is somewhat arbitrary  The classes overlap at the meeting points  and the distinctions are strictly man made  not directly apparent in the physics of the waves under study  There is  for example  no difference between an X ray and a gamma ray except a relative difference in frequency  and thus energy   This spectrum of radiant energy can be divided into ionizing and non ionizing  according to whether it ionizes or does not ionize the atoms in ordinary chemical matter  Ionization is the removing of electrons from atoms  and it may be partial  in which the weaker held outer electrons are removed  grading upwards to removal of all electrons from an atom  The energy required to do this varies with the kinds of atoms and their physical state  such as temperature  chemical binding and so on  Some overlap of ionizing and non ionizing radiation exists in the domain of ultraviolet where materials experience first simple thermal heating in the infrared and visible light  then excitation of electrons in  softer  UV  and then partial to total ionization as the energy increases with frequency  The second definition of radiation in the opening paragraph is used in reference to ionizing radiation in hard UV  x rays  and gamma rays   Both ionizing and non ionizing radiation can be harmful to organisms and can result in changes to the natural environment  In general  however  ionizing radiation is far more harmful to living organisms per unit of energy deposited than non ionizing radiation  since the ions that are produced  even at low radiation powers  leave behind atoms which  due to charge imbalance  are eager to combine in semi random ways with other atoms in the environment  these are called free radicals  Such random chemical action in a cell may result in anything from harmless reactions  to degradation of important structures in the cell  to killing it outright or triggering suicide  apoptosis   or modifying the DNA in harmful  but yet temporarily viable ways  By contrast  most non ionizing radiation is harmful to organisms only in proportion to the thermal energy deposited  a prime example is microwaves generated in a microwave oven   and is conventionally considered harmless at low powers that do not produce a significant temperature rise  Ultraviolet radiation in some aspects occupies the overlap in a middle ground  as it has some features of both ionizing and non ionizing radiation  Although nearly all of the ultraviolet spectrum that penetrates the Earth s atmosphere is non ionizing  this radiation does far more damage to many molecules in biological systems than can be accounted for by heating effects  such as sunburn   These properties derive from ultraviolet s power to alter chemical bonds  even without having quite enough energy to ionize atoms   The question of harm to biological systems due to low power ionizing and non ionizing radiation is not settled  Controversy continues about possible non heating effects of low power non ionizing radiation  such as non heating microwave and radio wave exposure  Non ionizing radiation is usually considered to have a safe lower limit  especially as thermal radiation is unavoidable and ubiquitous  By contrast  ionizing radiation is currently conservatively considered to have no completely safe lower limit  although at some energy levels  new exposures do not add appreciably to background radiation  The evidence that small amounts of some types of ionizing radiation might confer a net health benefit in some situations is called radiation hormesis   1  Ionizing radiation  Radiation with sufficiently high energy can ionize atoms  that is to say it can knock electrons off atoms and create ions  as well as lower energy damage such as breaking chemical bonds within molecules  Ionization occurs when an electron is stripped  or  knocked out   from an electron shell of the atom  which leaves the atom with a net positive charge  Because living cells and  more importantly  the DNA in those cells can be damaged by this ionization  exposure to ionizing radiation is considered to result in an increased chance of cancer  Thus  ionizing radiation  is somewhat artificially separated from particle radiation and electromagnetic radiation  simply due to its great potential for biological damage  While an individual cell is made of trillions of atoms  only a small fraction of those will be ionized at low to moderate radiation powers  The probability of ionizing radiation causing cancer is dependent upon the absorbed dose of the radiation  and is a function of the damaging tendency of the type of radiation  equivalent dose  and the sensitivity of the irradiated organism or tissues  effective dose    If the source of the ionizing radiation is a radioactive material or a nuclear process such as fission or fusion  there is also particle radiation to consider  Particle radiation is quantities of subatomic particles accelerated to relativistic speeds by nuclear reactions  Because of their momenta they are also quite capable of knocking out electrons and ionizing materials  but since most have an electrical charge  they don t have the penetrating power of ionizing radiation  The exception is neutron particles  see below  There are several different kinds of these particles  but the majority are alpha particles  beta particles  neutrons  and protons  Roughly speaking  EM photons and particles with energies above about 10 electron volts  eV  are ionizing  and that includes most cases for all these particles   Ionizing radiation originates from radioactive materials  X ray tubes  particle accelerators  nuclear weapons  nuclear reactors  space  cosmic rays  and is naturally present in the environment  since most rock and soil has small concentrations of radioactive materials  The radiation is invisible and not directly detectable by human senses  as a result  instruments such as Geiger counters are usually required to detect its presence  In some cases  it may lead to secondary emission of visible light upon its interaction with matter  as in the case of Cherenkov radiation and radio luminescence  Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine  research and construction  but presents a health hazard if used improperly  Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue  high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome  ARS   with skin burns  hair loss  internal organ failure and death  while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage  a particular form of cancer  thyroid cancer  often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product  I 131  However  calculating exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based on data from the atomic bombing in Japan and from reactor accident follow up  such as with the Chernobyl disaster  The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that  The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values    Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment  and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections  and  in particular  the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective eﬀective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided    1 1  Ultraviolet radiation  Ultraviolet of wavelengths from 10 nm to 125 nm ionizes air molecules  and this interaction causes it to be strongly absorbed by air  ozone  O3  in particular  Ionizing UV therefore does not penetrate Earth s atmosphere to a significant degree  and is sometimes referred to as vacuum ultraviolet  There is a zone of the atmosphere in which ozone absorbs some 98% of UV  starting about high and extending upward  Although present in space  this part of the UV spectrum is not of biological importance  because it does not reach living organisms on Earth  thanks to this ozone layer   Some of the ultraviolet spectrum that does reach the ground  the part that begins above energies of 3 1 eV  or wavelength less than 400 nm  is non ionizing  but is still biologically hazardous due to the ability of single photons of this energy to cause electronic excitation in biological molecules  and thus damage them by means of unwanted reactions  An example is the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA  which begins at wavelengths below 365 nm  3 4 eV   which is well below ionization energy  This property gives the ultraviolet spectrum some of the dangers of ionizing radiation in biological systems without actual ionization occurring  In contrast  visible light and longer wavelength electromagnetic radiation  such as infrared  microwaves  and radio waves  consists of photons with too little energy to cause damaging molecular excitation  and thus this radiation is far less hazardous per unit of energy   1 2  X ray  X rays are electromagnetic waves with a wavelength less than about 10−9 m  greater than 3x1017 Hz and 1 240 eV   A smaller wavelength corresponds to a higher energy according to the equation E hc λ    E  is Energy   h  is Planck s constant   c  is the speed of light   λ  is wavelength   When an X ray photon collides with an atom  the atom may absorb the energy of the photon and boost an electron to a higher orbital level or if the photon is very energetic  it may knock an electron from the atom altogether  causing the atom to ionize  Generally  larger atoms are more likely to absorb an X ray photon since they have greater energy differences between orbital electrons  Soft tissue in the human body is composed of smaller atoms than the calcium atoms that make up bone  hence there is a contrast in the absorption of X rays  X ray machines are specifically designed to take advantage of the absorption difference between bone and soft tissue  allowing physicians to examine structure in the human body   X rays are also totally absorbed by the thickness of the earth s atmosphere  resulting in the prevention of the X ray output of the sun  smaller in quantity than that of UV but nonetheless powerful  from reaching the surface   1 3  Gamma radiation  Gamma  γ  radiation consists of photons with a wavelength less than 3x10 −11 meters  greater than 1019 Hz and 41 4 keV   Gamma radiation emission is a nuclear process that occurs to rid an unstable nucleus of excess energy after most nuclear reactions  Both alpha and beta particles have an electric charge and mass  and thus are quite likely to interact with other atoms in their path  Gamma radiation  however  is composed of photons  which have neither mass nor electric charge and  as a result  penetrates much further through matter than either alpha or beta radiation   Gamma rays can be stopped by a sufficiently thick or dense layer of material  where the stopping power of the material per given area depends mostly  but not entirely  on the total mass along the path of the radiation  regardless of whether the material is of high or low density  However  as is the case with X rays  materials with high atomic number such as lead or depleted uranium add a modest  typically 20% to 30%  amount of stopping power over an equal mass of less dense and lower atomic weight materials  such as water or concrete   The atmosphere absorbs all gamma rays approaching Earth from space  Even air is capable of absorbing gamma rays  halving the energy of such waves by passing through  on the average     1 4  Alpha radiation  Alpha particles are helium 4 nuclei  two protons and two neutrons   They interact with matter strongly due to their charges and combined mass  and at their usual velocities only penetrate a few centimeters of air  or a few millimeters of low density material  such as the thin mica material which is specially placed in some Geiger counter tubes to allow alpha particles in   This means that alpha particles from ordinary alpha decay do not penetrate the outer layers of dead skin cells and cause no damage to the live tissues below  Some very high energy alpha particles compose about 10% of cosmic rays  and these are capable of penetrating the body and even thin metal plates  However  they are of danger only to astronauts  since they are deflected by the Earth s magnetic field and then stopped by its atmosphere   Alpha radiation is dangerous when alpha emitting radioisotopes are ingested  breathed or swallowed   This brings the radioisotope close enough to sensitive live tissue for the alpha radiation to damage cells  Per unit of energy  alpha particles are at least 20 times more effective at cell damage as gamma rays and X rays  See relative biological effectiveness for a discussion of this  Examples of highly poisonous alpha emitters are all isotopes of radium  radon  and polonium  due to the amount of decay that occur in these short half life materials   1 5  Beta radiation  Beta minus  β−  radiation consists of an energetic electron  It is more penetrating than alpha radiation  but less than gamma  Beta radiation from radioactive decay can be stopped with a few centimeters of plastic or a few millimeters of metal  It occurs when a neutron decays into a proton in a nucleus  releasing the beta particle and an antineutrino  Beta radiation from linac accelerators is far more energetic and penetrating than natural beta radiation  It is sometimes used therapeutically in radiotherapy to treat superficial tumors   Beta plus  β+  radiation is the emission of positrons  which are the antimatter form of electrons  When a positron slows down to speeds similar to those of electrons in the material  the positron will annihilate an electron  releasing two gamma photons of 511 keV in the process  Those two gamma photons will be traveling in  approximately  opposite direction  The gamma radiation from positron annihilation consists of high energy photons  and is also ionizing   1 6  Neutron radiation  Neutrons are categorized according to their speed energy  Neutron radiation consists of free neutrons  These neutrons may be emitted during either spontaneous or induced nuclear fission  Neutrons are rare radiation particles  they result in large amounts only where chain reaction fission or fusion reactions are active  this happens for about 10 microseconds in a thermonuclear explosion  or continuously inside an operating nuclear reactor  the neutrons stop almost immediately in the reactor when it goes non critical   Neutrons are the only type of ionizing radiation that can make other objects  or material  radioactive  This process  called neutron activation  is the primary method used to produce radioactive sources for use in medical  academic  and industrial applications  Even comparatively low speed thermal neutrons  will cause neutron activation  in fact  they cause it more efficiently   Neutrons do not ionize atoms in the same way that charged particles such as protons and electrons do  by the excitation of an electron   because neutrons have no charge  It is through their absorption by and the creation of unstable nuclei that they cause ionization  Such neutrons are  indirectly ionizing   Even neutrons without significant kinetic energy are indirectly ionizing  and are thus a significant radiation hazard  Not all materials are capable of neutron activation  in water  for example  both of the normal atoms present will capture neutrons and become heavier but still stable forms of those atoms  Only the absorption of more than one neutron  a statistically rare occurrence  can activate a hydrogen atom  while oxygen requires two additional absorptions  Thus water is only very weakly capable of activation  The sodium in salt  as in sea water   on the other hand  need only absorb a single neutron to become Na 24  a very intense source of beta decay  with half life of 15 hours   In addition  high energy  high speed  neutrons have the ability to directly ionize atoms  One mechanism by which high energy neutrons ionize atoms is to strike the nucleus of an atom and knock the atom out of a molecule  leaving one or more electrons behind as the chemical bond is broken  This leads to production of chemical free radicals  In addition  very high energy neutrons can cause ionizing radiation by  neutron spallation  or knockout  wherein neutrons cause emission of high energy protons from atomic nuclei  especially hydrogen nuclei  on impact  The last process imparts most of the neutron s energy to the proton  much like one billiard ball striking another  The charged protons  and other products from such reactions are directly ionizing   High energy neutrons are very penetrating and can travel great distances in air  hundreds or even thousands of meters  and moderate distances  several meters  in common solids  They typically require hydrogen rich shielding  such as concrete or water  to block them within distances of less than a meter  A common source of neutron radiation occurs inside a nuclear reactor  where a meters thick water layer is used as effective shielding   2  Cosmic radiation  There are two sources of high energy particles entering the Earth s atmosphere from outer space  the sun and deep space  The sun continuously emits particles  primarily free protons  in the solar wind  and occasionally augments the flow hugely with coronal mass ejections  CME   The particles from deep space  inter  and extra galactic  are much less frequent  but of much higher energies  These particles are not yet well understood  but seem to be remnants of supernovae and especially gamma ray bursts  GRB   which feature magnetic fields capable of the huge accelerations measured from these particles  They may also be generated by quasars  which are galaxy wide jet phenomena similar to GRBs but for their much larger size  and which seem to be violent part of the universe s early history   3  Non ionizing radiation  The kinetic energy of particles of non ionizing radiation is too small to produce charged ions when passing through matter  For non ionizing electromagnetic radiation  see types below   the associated particles  photons  have only sufficient energy to change the rotational  vibrational or electronic valence configurations of molecules and atoms  The effect of non ionizing forms of radiation on living tissue has only recently been studied  Nevertheless  different biological effects are observed for different types of non ionizing radiation   Even  non ionizing  radiation is capable of causing thermal ionization if it deposits enough heat to raise temperatures to ionization energies  These reactions occur at far higher energies than with ionization radiation  which requires only single particles to cause ionization  A familiar example of thermal ionization is the flame ionization of a common fire  and the browning reactions in common food items induced by infrared radiation  during broiling type cooking   3 1  Non ionizing electromagnetic radiation  The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible electromagnetic radiation frequencies  The electromagnetic spectrum  usually just spectrum  of an object is the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by  or absorbed by  that particular object   The non ionizing portion of electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves that  as individual quanta or particles  see photon  are not energetic enough to detach electrons from atoms or molecules and hence cause their ionization  These include radio waves  microwaves  infrared  and  sometimes  visible light  The lower frequencies of ultraviolet light may cause chemical changes and molecular damage similar to ionization  but is technically not ionizing  The highest frequencies of ultraviolet light  as well as all X rays and gamma rays are ionizing   The occurrence of ionization depends on the energy of the individual particles or waves  and not on their number  An intense flood of particles or waves will not cause ionization if these particles or waves do not carry enough energy to be ionizing  unless they raise the temperature of a body to a point high enough to ionize small fractions of atoms or molecules by the process of thermal ionization  this  however  requires relatively extreme radiation intensities    3 1 1  Ultraviolet light  As noted above  the lower part of the spectrum of ultraviolet  called soft UV  from 3 eV to about 10 eV  is non ionizing  However  the effects of non ionizing ultraviolet on chemistry and the damage to biological systems exposed to it  including oxidation  mutation  and cancer  are such that even this part of ultraviolet is often compared with ionizing radiation   3 1 2  Visible light  Light  or visible light  is a very narrow range of electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength that is visible to the human eye  or 380–750 nm which equates to a frequency range of 790 to 400 THz respectively  More broadly  physicists use the term  light  to mean electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths  whether visible or not   3 1 3  Infrared  Infrared  IR  light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0 7 and 300 micrometers  which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 to 1 THz respectively  IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light  but shorter than that of microwaves  Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by  feel   Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads  called  pits   Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per square meter at sea level  Of this energy  53% is infrared radiation  44% is visible light  and 3% is ultraviolet radiation   3 1 4  Microwave  Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths ranging from as short as one millimeter to as long as one meter  which equates to a frequency range of 300 GHz to 300 MHz  This broad definition includes both UHF and EHF  millimeter waves   but various sources use different other limits  In all cases  microwaves include the entire super high frequency band  3 to 30 GHz  or 10 to 1 cm  at minimum  with RF engineering often putting the lower boundary at 1 GHz  30 cm   and the upper around 100 GHz  3mm    3 1 5  Radio waves  Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light  Like all other electromagnetic waves  they travel at the speed of light  Naturally occurring radio waves are made by lightning  or by certain astronomical objects  Artificially generated radio waves are used for fixed and mobile radio communication  broadcasting  radar and other navigation systems  satellite communication  computer networks and innumerable other applications  In addition  almost any wire carrying alternating current will radiate some of the energy away as radio waves  these are mostly termed interference  Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth s atmosphere  long waves may bend at the rate of the curvature of the Earth and may cover a part of the Earth very consistently  shorter waves travel around the world by multiple reflections off the ionosphere and the Earth  Much shorter wavelengths bend or reflect very little and travel along the line of sight   3 1 6  Very low frequency  VLF   Very low frequency  or VLF  refers to a frequency range of 30 Hz to 3 kHz which corresponds to wavelengths of 100 000 to 10 000 meters respectively  Since there is not much bandwidth in this range of the radio spectrum  only the very simplest signals can be transmitted  such as for radio navigation  Also known as the myriameter band or myriameter wave as the wavelengths range from ten to one myriameter  an obsolete metric unit equal to 10 kilometers    3 1 7  Extremely low frequency  ELF   Extremely low frequency  ELF  is radiation frequencies from 3 to 30 Hz  108 to 107 meters respectively   In atmosphere science  an alternative definition is usually given  from 3 Hz to 3 kHz  In the related magnetosphere science  the lower frequency electromagnetic oscillations  pulsations occurring below ~3 Hz  are considered to lie in the ULF range  which is thus also defined differently from the ITU Radio Bands  A massive military ELF antenna in Michigan radiates very slow messages to otherwise unreachable receivers  such as submerged submarines   3 1 8  Thermal radiation  heat   Thermal radiation is a common synonym for infrared radiation emitted by objects at temperatures often encountered on Earth  Thermal radiation refers not only to the radiation itself  but also the process by which the surface of an object radiates its thermal energy in the form black body radiation  Infrared or red radiation from a common household radiator or electric heater is an example of thermal radiation  as is the heat emitted by an operating incandescent light bulb  Thermal radiation is generated when energy from the movement of charged particles within atoms is converted to electromagnetic radiation   As noted above  even low frequency thermal radiation may cause temperature ionization whenever it deposits sufficient thermal energy to raises temperatures to a high enough level  Common examples of this are the ionization  plasma  seen in common flames  and the molecular changes caused by the  browning  during food cooking  which is a chemical process that begins with a large component of ionization   3 1 9  Black body radiation  Black body radiation is an idealized spectrum of radiation emitted by a body that is at a uniform temperature  The shape of the spectrum and the total amount of energy emitted by the body is a function the absolute temperature of the body  The radiation emitted covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum and the intensity of the radiation  power unit area  at a given frequency is described by Planck s law of radiation  For a given temperature of a black body there is some frequency at which the maximum amount of radiation is emitted  That maximum radiation frequency moves toward higher frequencies as the temperature of the body increases  The frequency at which the black body radiation is at maximum is given by Wien s displacement law and is a function of the body s absolute temperature  A black body is one that emits at any temperature the maximum possible amount of radiation at any given wavelength  A black body will also absorb the maximum possible incident radiation at any given wavelength  A black body with a temperature at or below room temperature would thus appear absolutely black  as it would not reflect any incident light nor would it emit enough radiation at visible wavelengths for our eyes to detect  Theoretically  a black body emits electromagnetic radiation over the entire spectrum from very low frequency radio waves to x rays  creating a continuum of radiation   The color of a radiating black body tells the temperature of its radiating surface  It is responsible for the color of stars  which vary from infrared through red  2 500K   to yellow  5 800K   to white and to blue white  15 000K  as the peak radiance passes through those points in the visible spectrum  When the peak is below the visible spectrum the body is black  while when it is above the body is blue white  since all the visible colors are represented from blue decreasing to red   4  Discovery  Electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than light were discovered in the early 19th century  The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to William Herschel  the astronomer  Herschel published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London  Herschel  like Ritter  used a prism to refract light from the Sun and detected the infrared  beyond the red part of the spectrum   through an increase in the temperature recorded by a thermometer   In 1801  the German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter made the discovery of ultraviolet by noting that the rays from a prism darkened silver chloride preparations more quickly than violet light  Ritter s experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography  Ritter noted that the UV rays were capable of causing chemical reactions   The first radio waves detected were not from a natural source  but were produced deliberately and artificially by the German scientist Heinrich Hertz in 1887  using electrical circuits calculated to produce oscillations in the radio frequency range  following formulas suggested by the equations of James Clerk Maxwell   Wilhelm Röntgen discovered and named X rays  While experimenting with high voltages applied to an evacuated tube on 8 November 1895  he noticed a fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass  Within a month  he discovered the main properties of X rays that we understand to this day   In 1896  Henri Becquerel found that rays emanating from certain minerals penetrated black paper and caused fogging of an unexposed photographic plate  His doctoral student Marie Curie discovered that only certain chemical elements gave off these rays of energy  She named this behavior radioactivity   Alpha rays  alpha particles  and beta rays  beta particles  were differentiated by Ernest Rutherford through simple experimentation in 1899  Rutherford used a generic pitchblende radioactive source and determined that the rays produced by the source had differing penetrations in materials  One type had short penetration  it was stopped by paper  and a positive charge  which Rutherford named alpha rays  The other was more penetrating  able to expose film through paper but not metal  and had a negative charge  and this type Rutherford named beta  This was the radiation that had been first detected by Becquerel from uranium salts  In 1900  the French scientist Paul Villard discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating type of radiation from radium  and after he described it  Rutherford realized it must be yet a third type of radiation  which in 1903 Rutherford named gamma rays   Henri Becquerel himself proved that beta rays are fast electrons  while Rutherford and Thomas Royds proved in 1909 that alpha particles are ionized helium  Rutherford and Edward Andrade proved in 1914 that gamma rays are like X rays  but with shorter wavelengths   Cosmic ray radiations striking the Earth from outer space were finally definitively recognized and proven to exist in 1912  as the scientist Victor Hess carried an electrometer to various altitudes in a free balloon flight  The nature of these radiations was only gradually understood in later years   Neutron radiation was discovered with the neutron by Chadwick  in 1932  A number of other high energy particulate radiations such as positrons  muons  and pions were discovered by cloud chamber examination of cosmic ray reactions shortly thereafter  and others types of particle radiation were produced artificially in particle accelerators  through the last half of the twentieth century   5  Uses of radiation  5 1  In medicine  Radiation and radioactive substances are used for diagnosis  treatment  and research  X rays  for example  pass through muscles and other soft tissue but are stopped by dense materials  This property of X rays enables doctors to find broken bones and to locate cancers that might be growing in the body  Doctors also find certain diseases by injecting a radioactive substance and monitoring the radiation given off as the substance moves through the body  Radiation used for cancer treatment is called ionizing radiation because it forms ions in the cells of the tissues it passes through as it dislodges electrons from atoms  This can kill cells or change genes so the cells cannot grow  Other forms of radiation such as radio waves  microwaves  and light waves are called non ionizing  They don t have as much energy and are not able to ionize cells   5 2  In communication  All modern communication systems use forms of electromagnetic radiation  Variations in the intensity of the radiation represent changes in the sound  pictures  or other information being transmitted  For example  a human voice can be sent as a radio wave or microwave by making the wave vary to correspond variations in the voice  Musicians have also experimented with gamma sonification  or using nuclear radiation  to produce sound and music   5 3  In science  Researchers use radioactive atoms to determine the age of materials that were once part of a living organism  The age of such materials can be estimated by measuring the amount of radioactive carbon they contain in a process called radiocarbon dating  Similarly  using other radioactive elements  the age of rocks and other geological features  even some man made objects  can be determined  this is called Radiometric dating  Environmental scientists use radioactive atoms  known as tracer atoms  to identify the pathways taken by pollutants through the environment   Radiation is used to determine the composition of materials in a process called neutron activation analysis  In this process  scientists bombard a sample of a substance with particles called neutrons  Some of the atoms in the sample absorb neutrons and become radioactive  The scientists can identify the elements in the sample by studying the emitted radiation   6  See also  Background radiation  which actually refers to the background ionizing radiation  Čerenkov radiation  Cosmic microwave background radiation  3 K
