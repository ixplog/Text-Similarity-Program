The chicken or the egg causality dilemma is commonly stated as  which came first  the chicken or the egg   To ancient philosophers  the question about the first chicken or egg also evoked the questions of how life and the universe in general began   Cultural references to the Chicken and Egg intend to point out the futility of identifying the first case of a circular cause and consequence  It could be considered that in this approach lies the most fundamental nature of the question  A literal answer is an egg according to some people  as egg laying species pre date the existence of chickens  To others  the chicken came first  seeing as chickens are merely domesticated Red Junglefowls  However  the metaphorical view sets a metaphysical ground to the dilemma  To better understand its metaphorical meaning  the question could be reformulated as   Which came first  X that can t come without Y  or Y that can t come without X    An equivalent situation arises in engineering and science known as circular reference  in which a parameter is required to calculate that parameter itself  Examples are Van der Waals equation and the Colebrook equation   1  History of the dilemma  Ancient references to the dilemma are found in the writings of classical philosophers  Their writings indicate that the proposed problem was perplexing to them and was commonly discussed by others of their time as well   Aristotle  384–322 BC  was puzzled by the idea that there could be a first bird or egg and concluded that both the bird and egg must have always existed   If there has been a first man he must have been born without father or mother 舑 which is repugnant to nature  For there could not have been a first egg to give a beginning to birds  or there should have been a first bird which gave a beginning to eggs  for a bird comes from an egg  The same he held good for all species  believing  with Plato   that everything before it appeared on earth had first its being in spirit    Plutarch  46–126  referred to a hen rather than simply a bird  Plutarch discussed a series of arguments based on questions posed in a symposium  Under the section entitled  Whether the hen or the egg came first   the discussion is introduced in such a way suggesting that the origin of the dilemma was even older      the problem about the egg and the hen  which of them came first  was dragged into our talk  a difficult problem which gives investigators much trouble  And Sulla my comrade said that with a small problem  as with a tool  we were rocking loose a great and heavy one  that of the creation of the world     Macrobius  early 5th century   a Roman philosopher  found the problem to be interesting   You jest about what you suppose to be a triviality  in asking whether the hen came first from an egg or the egg from a hen  but the point should be regarded as one of importance  one worthy of discussion  and careful discussion at that   In System of Nature by Baron D Holbach  1770  translated into English in 1797   he asks  was the animal anterior to the egg  or did the egg precede the animal    part 1  chapter 6    Stephen Hawking and Christopher Langan argue that the egg came before the chicken  though the real importance of the question has faded since Darwin s On the Origin of Species and the accompanying Theory of Evolution  under which the egg must have come first  assuming the question intended  egg  to mean an egg in general rather than an egg that hatches into a chicken  According to Popular Science  the egg came first as it evolved prior to birds   2  Responses to the dilemma  2 1  Proteins  Professor Charito Sulatar and David Quigley  from the University of Warwick  who helped develop a study with colleagues from Sheffield University  point out that in fact a key chicken protein  ovocleidin 17  which helps in the formation of the egg s hard shell  actually comes both before and after the egg shell  They say that this chemical quirk actually makes the question of which came first even more pointless than before  As Professor Mark Rodger says   Does this really prove the chicken came before the egg   This science does give new insight into an efficient and fast method of crystallization  It will help in research to devise better synthetic bone and research into how to store sequester CO2 as limestone    A previous analysis which came to another conclusion  Professor John Brookfield and Professor David Papineau argue since there was a  first  chicken  it must have come from an egg which pre dated that chicken  An even earlier analysis which also came to another conclusion was made by Roy A  Sorensen in his one page article in 1992  He argued that although it is indeterminate which animal was the first chicken  the question of whether the chicken or the chicken egg came first has a determinate answer  Since an animal does not evolve into another species during its lifetime  and since organisms can fail to breed true  it is biologically necessary that the chicken egg came first  Biologist PZ Myers points out a further flaw in the  protein argument   in that other birds make use of different kinds of proteins for producing eggs  and that the evolution of ovocleidin was not coincident with the evolution of eggs  ovocleidin developed from prior proteins  which were used to form eggs since before birds branched away evolutionarily from reptiles   2 2  Science  The theory of evolution states that species change over time via mutation and sexual reproduction  Since DNA  deoxyribonucleic acid  can be modified before and after birth  it can be argued that a mutation must have taken place at conception or within an egg such that a creature similar to a chicken  but not a chicken  laid the first chicken eggs  These eggs then hatched into chickens that inbred to produce a living population  Hence  in this light  both the chicken and the structure of its egg evolved simultaneously from birds that  while not of the same exact species  gradually became more and more like present day chickens over time   However  no one mutation in one individual can be considered as constituting a new species  A speciation event involves the separation of one population from its parent population  so that interbreeding ceases  this is the process whereby domesticated animals are genetically separated from their wild forebears  The whole separated group can then be recognized as a new species   The modern chicken was believed to have descended from another closely related species of birds  the red junglefowl  but recently discovered genetic evidence suggests that the modern domestic chicken is a hybrid descendant of both the red junglefowl and the grey junglefowl  Assuming the evidence bears out  a hybrid is a compelling scenario that the chicken egg  based on the second definition  came before the chicken   This implies that the egg existed before the chicken  but that the chicken egg did not exist until an arbitrary threshold was crossed that differentiates a modern chicken from its ancestors  Even if such a threshold could be defined  an observer would be unlikely to identify that the threshold had been crossed until the first chicken had been hatched and hence the first chicken egg could not be identified as such   A simple view is that at whatever point the threshold was crossed and the first chicken was hatched  it had to hatch from an egg  The type of bird that laid that egg  by definition  was on the other side of the threshold and therefore not a chicken—it may be viewed as a proto chicken or ancestral chicken of some sort  from which a genetic variation or mutation occurred that resulted in the egg being laid containing the embryo of the first chicken  In this light  the argument is settled and the  egg  had to have come first  However  whether this was defined as a chicken egg or proto chicken egg is debatable  So technically the egg came before the chicken  but the chicken may have come before the chicken egg  So it depends on whether the question is  What came first  the Chicken or the egg  or  what came first  the Chicken or the Chicken egg    Logically the final conclusion can be drawn that the egg indeed came before the chicken  as a bird that was not a chicken could accumulate germline mutations in a single sperm or ovum to produce the first genetically identifiable chicken  but a non chicken egg is much less likely to produce a non chicken which accumulates enough identical somatic cell mutations across its cells to create a chicken spontaneously   3  Chicken and egg problem  The term  chicken and egg problem  is further commonly used to describe a situation that is not a philosophical dilemma  but one in which it is impossible to reach a certain desired outcome because a necessary precondition is not satisfied  while to meet that precondition in turn requires that the desired outcome has already been realized  For example  it has been argued that the transformation to alternative fuels for vehicles faces a chicken and egg problem   it is not economical for individuals to purchase vehicles using alternative fuels absent sufficient refueling stations  and it is not economical for fuel dealers to open stations absent sufficient alternative fuel vehicles   This is closely related to the economic concept of vicious circle  but in this kind of situation one that becomes a virtuous circle upon reaching a tipping point   4  References in popular culture  In the TV special The Easter Bunny Is Comin  To Town  the
