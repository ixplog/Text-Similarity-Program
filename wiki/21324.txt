Nepal measures about along its Himalayan axis by across  With it slightly outranks the state of Arkansas in the United States  Nepal is landlocked by India on three sides and China s Tibet Autonomous Region to the north  West Bengal s narrow Siliguri Corridor or Chicken s Neck separate Nepal and Bangladesh  To the east are India and Bhutan  Nepal depends on India for goods transport facilities and access to the sea  even for most goods imported from China   1  The land  For a small country  Nepal has tremendous geographic diversity  It rises from as low as elevation in the tropical Terai—the northern rim of the Gangetic Plain  beyond the perpetual snow line to some 90 peaks over including Earth s highest Mount Everest or Sagarmatha  In addition to the continuum from tropical warmth to cold comparable to polar regions  average annual precipitation varies from as little as in the rainshadow north of the Himalaya to as much as on windward slopes   Along a south to north transect  Nepal can be divided into three belts  Terai  Hill and Mountain Regions  In the other direction it is divided into three major river systems  from east to west  Koshi  Gandaki Narayani and Karnali  including the Mahakali Sarda along the western border   all tributaries of the Ganges  The Ganges Yarlung Zangbo Brahmaputra watershed largely coincides with the Nepal Tibet border  however several Ganges tributaries rise inside Tibet   1 1  Terai Region  The Terai  also Tarai  or Madhesh region begins at the Indian border and includes the southernmost part of the flat  intensively farmed Gangetic Plain called the Outer Terai  By the 19th century  timber and other resources were being exported to India  Industrialization based on agricultural products such as jute began in the 1930s and infrastructure such roadways  railways and electricity were extended across the border before it reached Nepal s hill regions   The Outer Terai is culturally more similar to adjacent parts of India s Bihar and Uttar Pradesh than to the hill region of Nepal  although government offices are largely staffed by Paharis  Nepali is taught in schools and often spoken in government offices  however the local population mostly uses the languages spoken across the border in Bihar and U P   The Outer Terai ends at the base of the first range of foothills called the Siwaliks or Churia  This range has a densely forested skirt of coarse alluvium called the bhabhar  Below the bhabhar  finer  less permeable sediments force groundwater to the surface in a zone of springs and marshes  In Persian  terai refers to wet or marshy ground  Before the use of DDT this was dangerously malarial  Nepal s rulers used this for a defensive frontier called the char kose jhadi  four kos forest  one kos equalling about three kilometers or two miles    Above the bhabhar belt  the Siwaliks rise to about with peaks as high as   steeper on their southern flanks because of faults known as the Main Frontal Thrust  This range is composed of poorly consolidated  coarse sediments that do not retain water or support soil development so there is virtually no agricultural potential and sparse population   In several places beyond the Siwaliks there are dūn valleys called Inner Terai  भित्री मधेश  Bhitrī Madhesh   These valleys have productive soil but were dangerously malarial except to indigenous Tharu people who had genetic resistance  In the mid 1950s DDT came into use to suppress mosquitos and the way was open to settlement from the land poor hills  to the detriment of the Tharu   The Terai ends and the Hills begin at a higher range of foothills called the Mahabharat Range   1 2  Hill Region  Situated south of the Mountain Region  the Hill Region  Pahar in Nepali  is mostly between altitude  This region begins at the Mahabharat Range  Lesser Himalaya  where a fault system called the Main Boundary Thrust creates an escarpment high  to a crest between    These steep southern slopes are nearly uninhabited  thus an effective buffer between languages and culture in the Terai and Hill regions  Hindu Paharis mainly populate river and stream bottoms that enable rice cultivation and are warm enough for winter spring crops of wheat and potato  The increasingly urbanized Kathmandu and Pokhara valleys fall within the Hill region  Newars are an indigenous ethnic group with their own Tibeto Burman language  The Newar were originally indigenous to the Kathmandu valley but have spread into Pokhara and other towns alongside urbanized Pahari   Other indigenous janajati ethnic groups  — natively speaking highly localized Tibeto Burman languages and dialects  — populate hillsides up to about   This group includes Magar and Kham Magar west of Pokhara  Gurung south of the Annapurnas  Tamang around the periphery of Kathmandu Valley and Rai  Koinch Sunuwar and Limbu further east  Temperate and subtropical fruits are grown as cash crops  Marijuana was grown and processed into Charas  hashish  until international pressure persuaded the government to outlaw it in 1976  There is increasing reliance on animal husbandry with elevation  using land above for summer grazing and moving herds to lower elevations in winter  Grain production has not kept pace with population growth at elevations above where colder temperatures inhibit double cropping  Food deficits drive emigration out of the hills in search of employment   The Hill region ends where ridges begin substantially rising out of the Temperate climate zone into subalpine climate above    1 3  Mountain Region  The Mountain Region or Parbat begins where high ridges  Nepali  लेख  lekh  begin substantially rising above into the subalpine and alpine zone which are mainly used for seasonal pasturage  A few tens kilometers further north the high Himalaya abruptly rise along the Main Central Thrust fault zone above the snow line at   Some 90 of Nepal s peaks exceed and eight exceed including Mount Everest at and Kanchenjunga at    Unlike the Mahabharats  the Himalaya are not continuous across Nepal  Instead there are some 20 subranges including the Kanchenjunga massif along the Sikkim border  Mahalangur Himal around Mt  Everest  Langtang north of Kathmandu  Annapurna and Manaslu north of Pokhara  then Dhaulagiri further west with Kanjiroba north of Jumla and finally Gurans Himal in the far west   1 4  Trans Himalayan Region  The main watershed between the Brahmaputra  called Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet  and the Ganges system  including all of Nepal  actually lies north of the highest ranges  Alpine  often semi arid valleys—including Humla  Jumla  Dolpo  Mustang  Manang and Khumbu—cut between Himalayan subranges or lie north of them  Some of these valleys historically were more accessible from Tibet than Nepal and are populated by people with Tibetan affinities called Bhotiya or Bhutia including the famous Sherpas in Kumbu valley near Mount Everest  With Chinese cultural hegemony in Tibet itself  these valleys have become repositories of traditional ways  Valleys with better access from the hill regions to the south are culturally linked to Nepal as well as Tibet  notably the Kali Gandaki Gorge where Thakali culture shows influences in both directions   Permanent villages in the mountain region stand as high as with summer encampments even higher  Bhotiyas graze yaks  grow cold tolerant crops such as potatoes  barley  buckwheat and millet  They traditionally traded across the mountains  e g   Tibetan salt for rice from lowlands in Nepal and India  Since trade was restricted in the 1950s they have found work as high altitude porters  guides  cooks and other accessories to tourism and alpinism   2  Climate  2 1  Altitudinal Belts  Nepal s latitude is about the same as that of Florida  however with elevations ranging from less than to over and precipitation from to over the country has eight climate zones from tropical to perpetual snow   The tropical zone below experiences frost less than once per decade  It can be subdivided into lower tropical  below 300 meters or 1 000 ft   with 18% of the nation s land area  and upper  18% of land area  tropical zones  The best mangoes and well as papaya and banana are largely confined to the lower zone  Other fruit such as litchee  jackfruit  citrus and mangoes of lower quality grow in the upper tropical zone as well  Winter crops include grains and vegetables typically grown in temperate climates  The Outer Terai is virtually all in the lower tropical zone  Inner Terai valleys span both tropical zones  The Sivalik Hills are mostly upper tropical  Tropical climate zones extend far up river valleys across the Middle Hills and even into the Mountain regions   The subtropical climate zone from occupies 22% of Nepal s land area and is the most prevalent climate of the Middle Hills above river valleys  It experiences frost up to 53 days per year  however this varies greatly with elevation  proximity to high mountains and terrain either draining or ponding cold air drainage  Crops include rice  maize  millet  wheat  potato  stone fruits and citrus   The great majority of Nepal s population occupies the tropical and subtropical climate zones  In the Middle Hills  upper caste Hindus are concentrated in tropical valleys which are well suited for rice cultivation while Janajati ethnic groups mostly live above in the subtropical zone and grow other grains more than rice   The Temperate climate zone from occupies 12% of Nepal s land area and has up to 153 annual days of frost  It is encountered in higher parts of the Middle Hills and throughout much of the Mountain region  Crops include cold tolerant rice  maize  wheat  barley  potato  apple  walnut  peach  various cole  amaranthus and buckwheat   The Subalpine zone from occupies 9% of Nepal s land area  mainly in the Mountain and Himalayan regions  It has permanent settlements in the Himalaya  but further south it is only seasonally occupied as pasture for sheep  goats  yak and hybrids in warmer months  There are up to 229 annual days of frost here  Crops include barley  potato  cabbage  cauliflower  amaranthus  buckwheat and apple  Medicinal plants are gathered   The Alpine zone from occupies 8% of the country s land area  There are a few permanent settlements above 4 000 meters  There is virtually no plant cultivation although medicinal herbs are gathered  Sheep  goats  yaks and hybrids are pastured in warmer months   Above 5 000 meters the climate becomes Nival and there is no human habitation or even seasonal use   Arid and semi arid land in the rainshadow of high ranges have a Transhimalayan climate  Population density is very low  Cultivation and husbandry conform to subalpine and alpine patterns but depend on snowmelt and streams for irrigation   Precipitation generally decreases from east to west with increasing distance from the Bay of Bengal  source of the summer monsoon  Eastern Nepal gets about annually  the Kathmandu area about and western Nepal about   This pattern is modified by adabiatic effects as rising air masses cool and drop their moisture content on windward slopes  then warm up as they descend so relative humidity drops  Annual precipitation reaches on windward slopes in the Annapurna Himalaya beyond a relatively low stretch of the Mahabharat Range  In rainshadows beyond the high mountains  annual precipitation drops as low as    2 2  Seasons  The year is divided into a wet season from June to September—as summer warmth over Inner Asia creates a low pressure zone that draws in moist air from the Indian Ocean—and a dry season from October to June as cold temperatures in the vast interior creates a high pressure zone causing dry air to flow outward  April and May are months of intense water stress when cumulative effects of the long dry season are exacerbated by temperatures rising over in the tropical climate belt  Seasonal drought further intensifies in the Siwaliks hills consisting of poorly consolidated  coarse  permeable sediments that do not retain water  so hillsides are often covered with drought tolerant scrub forest  In fact much of Nepal s native vegetation adapted to withstand drought  but less so at higher elevations where cooler temperatures mean less water stress   The summer monsoon may be preceded by a buildup of thunderstorm activity that provides water for rice seedbeds  Sustained rain on average arrives in mid June as rising temperatures over Inner Asia creates a low pressure zone that draws in moist air from the Indian Ocean  but this can vary up to a month  Significant failure of monsoon rains historically meant drought and famine while above normal rains still cause flooding and landslides with losses in human lives  farmland and buildings  The monsoon also complicates transportation with roads and trails washing out while unpaved roads and airstrips may become unusable and cloud cover reduces safety margins for aviation  Rains diminish in September and generally end by mid October  ushering in generally cool  clear  and dry weather  as well as the most relaxed and jovial period in Nepal  By this time  the harvest is completed and people are in a festive mood  The two biggest and most important Hindu festivals—Dashain and Tihar  Dipawali —arrive during this period  about one month apart  The post monsoon season lasts until about December   After the post monsoon comes the winter monsoon  a strong north easterly flow marked by occasional  short rainfalls in the lowlands and plains and snowfalls in the high altitude areas In this season the Himalayas function as a barrier to cold air masses from Inner Asia  so southern Nepal and northern India have warmer winters than would otherwise be the case  April and May are dry and hot  especially below where afternoon temperatures may exceed    3  Environment  The dramatic changes in elevation along this transect result in a variety of biomes  from tropical savannas along the Indian border  to subtropical broadleaf and coniferous forests in the hills  to temperate broadleaf and coniferous forests on the slopes of the Himalaya  to montane grasslands and shrublands  and finally rock and ice at the highest elevations   This corresponds to the Terai Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion   Subtropical forests dominate the lower elevations of the Hill Region  They form a mosaic running east west across Nepal  with Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests between and Himalayan subtropical pine forests between   At higher elevations  to   are found temperate broadleaf forests  eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests to the east of the Gandaki River and western Himalayan broadleaf forests to the west   The native forests of the Mountain Region change from east to west as precipitation decreases  They can be broadly classified by their relation to the Gandaki River  From are the eastern and western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests  To are the eastern and western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows   3 1  Environmental concerns    Natural hazards   4  River systems  Nepal has three categories of rivers  The largest systems  — from east to west Koshi  Gandaki Narayani  Karnali Goghra and Mahakali—originate in multiple tributaries rising in or beyond the high Himalaya that maintain substantial flows from snowmelt through the hot  droughty spring before the summer monsoon  These tributaries cross the highest mountains in deep gorges  flow south through the Middle Hills  then join in candelabra like configuration before crossing the Mahabharat Range and emerging onto the plains where they have deposited megafans exceeding area   The Koshi is also called Sapta Koshi for its seven Himalayan tributaries in eastern Nepal  Indrawati  Sun Koshi  Tama Koshi  Dudh Koshi  Liku  Arun  and Tamur  The Arun rises in Tibet some beyond Nepal s northern border  A tributary of the Sun Koshi  Bhote Koshi also rises in Tibet and is followed by the Arniko Highway connecting Kathmandu and Lhasa   The Gandaki Narayani has seven Himalayan tributaries in the center of the country  Daraudi  Seti Gandaki  Madi  Kali  Marsyandi  Budhi  and Trisuli also called Sapta Gandaki  The Kali Gandaki rises on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and flows through the semi independent Kingdom of Mustang  then between the 8 000 meter Dhaulagiri and Annapurna ranges in the world s deepest valley  The Trisuli rises north of the international border inside Tibet  After the seven upper tributaries join  the river becomes the Narayani inside Nepal and is joined by the  East  Rapti from Chitwan Valley  Crossing into India  its name changes to Gandak   The Karnali drains western Nepal  with the Bheri and Seti as major tributaries  The upper Bheri drains Dolpo  a remote valley beyond the Dhaulagiri Himalaya with traditional Tibetan cultural affinities  The upper Karnali rises inside Tibet near sacred Lake Manasarovar and Mount Kailash  The area around these features is the hydrographic nexus of South Asia since it holds the sources of the Indus and its major tributary the Sutlej  the Karnali—a Ganges tributary—and the Yarlung Tsangpo Brahmaputra  It is the center of the universe according to traditional cosmography  The Mahakali or Kali along the Nepal India border on the west joins the Karnali in India  where the river is known as Goghra or Ghaghara   Second category rivers rise in the Middle Hills and Mahabharat Range  from east to west the Mechi  Kankai and Kamala south of the Kosi  the Bagmati that drains Kathmandu Valley between the Kosi and Gandaki systems  then the West Rapti and the Babai between the Gandaki and Karnali systems  Without glacial sources  annual flow regimes in these rivers are more variable although limited flow persists through the dry season   Third category rivers rise in the outermost Siwalik foothills and are mostly seasonal   None of these river systems support significant commercial navigation  Instead  deep gorges create obstacles to establishing transport and communication networks and de fragmenting the economy  Foot trails are still primary transportation routes in many hill districts   4 1  River management  Rivers in all three categories are capable of causing serious floods  Koshi River in the first category caused a major flood in August 2008 in Bihar state  India after breaking through a poorly maintained embankment just inside Nepal The West Rapti in the second category is called Gorakhpur s Sorrow for its history of urban flooding  Third category Terai rivers are associated with flash floods  Since uplift and erosion are more or less in equilibrium in the Himalaya  at least where the climate is humid  rapid uplift must be balanced out by annual increments of millions tonnes of sediments washing down from the mountains  then on the plains settling out of suspension on vast alluvial fans over which rivers meander and change course at least every few decades  causing some experts to question whether manmade embankments can contain the problem of flooding  Traditional Mithila culture along the lower Koshi in Nepal and Bihar celebrated the river as the giver of life for its fertile alluvial soil  yet also the taker of life through its catastrophic floods   Large reservoirs in the Middle Hills may be able to capture peak flows and mitigate downstream flooding  to store surplus monsoon flows for dry season irrigation and to generate electricity  Water for irrigation is especially compelling because the Indian Terai is suspected to have entered a food bubble where dry season crops are dependent on water from tubewells that in the aggregate are unsustainably  mining  groundwater  Depletion of acquifers without building upstream dams as a sustainable alternative water source could precipitate a Malthusian catastrophe in India s food insecure states Uttar Pradesh and Bihar   with over 300 million combined population  With India already experiencing a Naxalite–Maoist insurgency in Bihar  Jharkhand and Andra Pradesh  Nepalese reluctance to agree to water projects could even seem an existential threat to India   As Nepal builds barrages to divert more water for irrigation during the dry season preceding the summer monsoon  there is less for downstream users in Bangladesh and India s Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states  The best solution could be building large upstream reservoirs  to capture and store surplus flows during summer monsoon as well as providing flood control benefits to Bangladesh and India  Then water sharing agreements could allocate a portion of the stored water to be left to flow into India during the following dry season   Nevertheless  building dams in Nepal is controversial for several reasons  First  the region is seismically active  Dam failures caused by earthquakes could cause tremendous death and destruction downstream  particularly on the densely populated Gangetic Plain  Second  global warming has led to the formation of glacial lakes dammed by unstable moraines  Sudden failures of these moraines can cause floods with cascading failures of manmade structures downstream  Third  sedimentation rates in the Himalaya are extremely high  leading to rapid loss of storage capacity as sediments accumulate behind dams  Fourth  there are complicated questions of cross border equity in how India and Nepal would share costs and benefits that have proven difficult to resolve in the context of frequent acrimony between the two countries   5  Area    Coastline   6  Resources and land use    Natural resources   7  Forests  25 4% of Nepal s land area  or about is covered with forest according to FAO figures from 2005  FAO estimates that around 9 6% of Nepal s forest cover consists of primary forest which is relatively intact  About 12 1% Nepal s forest is classified as protected while about 21 4% is conserved according to FAO  About 5 1% Nepal s forests are classified as production forest  Between 2000 2005  Nepal lost about of forest  Nepal s 2000 2005 total deforestation rate was about 1 4% per year meaning it lost an average of of forest annually  Nepal s total deforestation rate from 1990 2000 was or 2 1% per year  The 2000 2005 true deforestation rate in Nepal  defined as the loss of primary forest  is  0 4% or per year   Deforestation is driven by multiple processes  Virtually throughout the nation  over harvest of firewood remains problematic  Despite the availability of liquefied petroleum gas in towns and cities  firewood is sold more at energy competitive prices because cutting and selling it is a fallback when better employment opportunities aren t forthcoming  Firewood still supplies 80% of Nepal s energy for heating and cooking  Harvesting construction timber and lopping branches for fodder for cattle and other farm animals are also deforestation degradation drivers in all geographic zones   Illegal logging is a problems in the Siwaliks  with sawlogs smuggled into India  Clearing for resettlement and agriculture expansion also causes deforestation as does urban expansion  building infrastructure such as schools  hospitals  electric transmission lines  water tanks  police and army barracks  temples and picnic areas   In the Middle Hills road construction  reservoirs  transmission lines and extractive manufacturing such as cement factories cause deforestation  In the mountains building hotels  monasteries and trekking trails cause deforestation while timber smuggling into the Tibet Autonomous Region and over grazing cause degradation   8  Boundaries  8 1  Border crossings with India  While India and Nepal have an open border with no restrictions on movement of their citizens on either side  there are 23 checkpoints for trade purposes  These are listed in counterclockwise order  east to west  The six in italics are also used for entry exit by third country nationals   8 2  Border crossings with Tibet Autonomous Region  China  These are listed west to east  Third country nationals cross at Tatopani and in guided groups at Simikot Hilsa  The Mustang crossing is mainly used by traders   9  See also  Nepal  List of mountains in Nepal  10  References  11  External links  bn নেপালের ভূগোল
